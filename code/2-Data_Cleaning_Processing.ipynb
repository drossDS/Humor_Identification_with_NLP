    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "This project is conducted from the standpoint of a data scientist hired by a university researching the relatability of AI chat bots and their ability to identify nuances of human language, particularly humor.  Some statements are considered funny, but are not necessarily presented as a joke.  The task is to come up with a language model that can identify humorous strings of text which are not structed in the format of a joke but are of similar structure to factual information.  Text must sourced to train and test a model which can differentiate between humorous and non-humorous statements.\n",

    "# Project Approach:\n",
    "The Onion is a satirical news organization which produces news titles and news stories often relevant to real, current events that are satirical or would otherwise be classified as absurdist humor.  For clarity **news articles and titles from The Onion are not real.**  The tiles are however, formated in the format of actual news titles and articles which, from legitimate news agencies - are not humorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the titles of posts to the subreddit r/TheOnion against the subreddit r/worldnews provides a way to compare strings of text which share many of the same formatting characteristics, but have completely different goals with respect to humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These subreddits are to be scraped and the data processed to see if a language model can idenifty the humorous Onion titles from the factual World News titles."

    "# Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing Approach\n",
    "In this notebook the news titles from both subreddits are explored and cleaned.  Ideally, when making this comparison, as little processing would be done as possible.  However, as will be shown below, the data collected suffer from a few issues:\n",
    "* Not all of the titles sourced through the 'pushshift' API are legitimate Onion or World News posts given that users are allowed to contribute what they want, and the pushshift API sources the information before the subreddit moderators are able to remove illegitimate news titles\n",
    "* Not all of the titles sourced are in English, which if not removed, would make a language model far more difficult to train\n",
    "* The data contain character errors \n",
    "* The titles contain information that would directly indidcate which subreddit the title is from\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the data cleaning and pre-processing was broken down into two stages:\n",
    "* A first stage - **ocurring in a previous notebook** - where only issues that would severly affect the model performance were removed such as bad characters, different languages\n",
    "    * After this, a few models were run to ensure that the models were capable of running on the collected data, and to baseline their performance on minimally processed data.  The hope in doing this was to uncover any issues that would prevent the word vectorizing or modeling methods from working prpoperly so that they could be identified early.\n",
    "* **A second stage of processing was performed in this notebook** and focused on isolating the true title text as much as possible and removing any identifiers in the titles that the model could be trained to recognize to immediately classify the model without considering the rest of its content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the goal is to process the titles in such a way that the true news article title content is isolated for comparison (as best as possible without manually examining and cleaning each title)."

    "In this notebook and the previous notebook, ALL data are processed BEFORE the train-test-split occurs.  The data are processed, and a models are run in between pre-processing stages to be retrained after the second stage of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a concern for data leakage.  However, as the ultimate goal of this task is to focus on the conent in the subreddit posts which are the ACTUAL titles of the news articles (and not the names of the news agencies, emjois, etc.), it will be argued that processing all data simultaneously (including those which will end up in the test dataset) is acceptable as long as the processing/cleaning only serves to isolate the true title content.  On the other hand, viewing titles that would end up in the test dataset and creating features which would specifically identify humor would not be acceptable and will be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differntly, this task is going beyond the subreddit designation and is focusing on humor.  Part of the challenge is to make this less about differntiating between subreddits and more about truly comapable pure news article titles.  Thus, viewing data that end up being in the test dataset for the purpose stripping away features which ONLY serve to idenify the reddit and have notthing to do with the news article title should be fair game for removal.\n",
