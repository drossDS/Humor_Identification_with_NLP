    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "This project is conducted from the standpoint of a data scientist hired by a university researching the relatability of AI chat bots and their ability to identify nuances of human language, particularly humor.  Some statements are considered funny, but are not necessarily presented as a joke.  The task is to come up with a language model that can identify humorous strings of text which are not structed in the format of a joke but are of similar structure to factual information.  Text must sourced to train and test a model which can differentiate between humorous and non-humorous statements."

    "# Project Approach:\n",
    "The Onion is a satirical news organization which produces news titles and news stories often relevant to real, current events that are satirical or would otherwise be classified as absurdist humor.  For clarity **news articles and titles from The Onion are not real.**  The tiles are however, formated in the format of actual news titles and articles which, from legitimate news agencies - are not humorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the titles of posts to the subreddit r/TheOnion against the subreddit r/worldnews provides a way to compare strings of text which share many of the same formatting characteristics, but have completely different goals with respect to humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These subreddits are to be scraped and the data processed to see if a language model can idenifty the humorous Onion titles from the factual World News titles."
