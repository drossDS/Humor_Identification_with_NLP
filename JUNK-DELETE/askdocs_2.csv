Yesterday morning I noticed a bump on the back of my upper right arm that looked like a spider bite. It was itchy and started oozing some pus as the day went on. I went to the doctor today after it got worse, and he told me that he doesn’t think it’s a spider bite. I mentioned to him that I had MRSA when I was 12, and he believes it could be coming back. I previously had some itchy spots on my other arm and leg, but those got better with another cream I was prescribed and they never had pus. The doctor collected some of the pus and is sending it off to be studied. It’ll take a few days for the results to come back. He gave me a couple prescriptions for pills and an ointment, but those don’t seem to be helping. The spot on my arm keeps getting worse. It’s now almost the size of a baseball. My arm is losing it’s strength and is starting to become numb with pins and needles. Does anyone know what this is and how to help it get better while I wait for results?

2,AskDocs,"Hi there,

(M30) Starting last Thursday (4/13), I started having a pain when I was coughing in my left upper quadrant and left flank. I had a kidney stone last July and though it might be another one, so I went to urgent care on Monday (4/17) and received a urinalysis, culture and was sent for an ultrasound. Additionally, I was prescribed Cipro. The PA who was helping me did a test where she tapped on my back on the left side and I had a reflex, so she said it may be a kidney infection. The UA, Culture and Ultrasound all came back normal and didn’t show any abnormalities. 

I started the antibiotics on Monday night but ended up vomiting about an hour and a half later, and didn’t vomit yesterday or today after taking the antibiotics. I followed up with the clinic I went to on Monday, however they seemed dismissive of my concerns that I’m still having pains despite all tests not showing anything. 

I believe it’s somewhat kidney related because the pain is in the same area when I initially had a kidney stone, but it seems different as it only hurts when coughing or moving excessively. My lower left flank is more of a dull constant and I’m not seeing blood or anything in my urine. My body temperature also seems to get super hot occasionally followed by being cold, so it almost feels like I’m fighting something internally. 

Happy to provide my vitals and UA if that would help, but ultimately wondering if anyone has any advice or could point me in the right direction.

4,AskDocs,"Hey all. This is a weird one.

I'm a male in my early 30's. Back in 2009 I had just clued up my last of three surgeries for a recurring pilonidal cyst, the previous two being left open to heal with packed dressings (and the last surgery was sutured).

I do remember the doctor saying they were going to have to get very close to my sphincter on the final surgery and they were worried about future use of my sphincter. 

Anyways, fast forward to 2023. I've been having periods of bleeding during bowel movements that come and go (maybe a couple times a year ever since 2009) and some periodic sharp pains around my anus. Also, as expected, some slight problems with ""leakage"" if I had too much fiber or something, also periodic. I also sometimes felt something hard down there when cleaning myself in the shower.

Anyways, my SO of 10 years is a nurse and I mentioned the above issues so she took a look which was all bad enough. Then she said she could see *a suture* right on my sphincter. Still intact after all these years, and I presume this was the hard thing I've been feeling for years (I thought it might have been hemorrhoids).

I'm obviously going to go to the doctor but I just wanted to see if you all thought this could be the cause of some or all of my issues in the region?

5,AskDocs,"Hello to all, 
  I really need help! To start off I'm a 22 year old white female, I have had some crazy things happen since June 16th, 2021. One night I had awoken from my sleep with the right side of my upper lip swollen! I thought maybe I got bit by a spider or something. I didn't have any other symptoms at the time. Went to the er. However I was given antibiotics and nothing more. They didn't know the cause. Fast forward to when the swelling went down.... it turned to blisters on that side, fluid filled but not really clusters... my whole mouth turned into oral lesions. My tongue, inside lips, hard palate. It was painful. I was in so much pain and couldn't get to see my primary care until it was almost gone. Magic mouthwash then colchicine. It was almost healed but I couldn't tell if it helped or not. They lasted about 8 days then healed. I could not eat, drink. I lose 8 pounds each time almost. Water burns, they burn so bad. 
October 2021, same thing. I was brushed off again by the er. I got some mouthwash to help. (It doesn't make it any more bearable.) Fast forward to December 22. It came back with a vengeance. I was in the er on Christmas, more antibiotics. Mind you I was already on antibiotics where I had a tooth extracted. They gave me clindamyecin and ordered me to continue the amoxicillin as well. It didn't help at all. I ended up having one vaginal ulcer as well. It was crazy!! I went to urgent cure and they assumed yeast infection. I was given fluconazole. It kind of helped. Then, in February less than a month later I got a UTI, I've never had one before!!! I was prescribed more antibiotics. After finishing the antibiotics two days later it happened again. Same swelling, same placement of ulcers. It was even harder that time. Magic mouth wash didn't even help it actually made my teeth hurt!! I had just got composite fillings in and it was just awful. I was also experiencing jaw pain as well. After this time it hasn't come back. I'm scared to eat, breathe, take medicine. I don't know what's causing this. Doctors aren't really trying to help me. My primary suspected behcets. I'm not sure. The gene test came back negative. My autoimmune panel came back negative mind you I wasn't flaring. My CRP protein was high for my age. My sugar also has been fluctuating. My gi tested me for stomach problems as I have IBS and colitis. I do not have IBD, or celiac. I'm getting both scopes soon but he recommended an ENT. It'll take a year just to see rheumatologist. I'm scared. It's awful. I also have joint pain and I'm always exhausted. I could sleep at any time for long times. I really don't feel validated at all. I'll attach photos as well. Someone help me point me in a direction! I can't find anyone on the internet like me at the moment. Any advice helps. Thank you for reading!

14,AskDocs,"Earlier this month I suddenly had a tingling sensation on the right side of my face. I went to a doctor, he orderd some blood tests to check for any deficiency. It came out normal so he mentioned it could be temporary, they also did some physical motor sensory tests to rule out stroke. I have been taking THC edibles about 2/3 times a week(usually on the weekends) for the past year and a half and I do drink some beer once a week. the next week I started getting the tingling on my left arm and fingers of both hands. So I went to the doctor again to see if there's any other test that could be done. I was asked to do blood work for magnesium, that came out normal. They also referred me to do an MRI, the MRI is scheduled for coming Saturday morning. 

Now, I know that I shouldn't Google these symptoms and self diagnose but everything pointed out to a possible brain tumor. I have been stressing out about this and waking in the middle of the night to just check if I can still fill my hands and arms. So last weekend onwards I have been feeling tingling reaching to my feet, mainly toes and my head feeling heavy and kind of lightheadedness, also having some difficulty focusing at work. So I went to see the doctor again. They did the motor test again and checked my blood sugar, it came out normal. And they referred me to a Neurologist to find out more. But since then, the twitching in my legs and toes has become more prominent and the more I think about it the worse it gets not sure if it's a seizure or not as it's pretty much constant as of now, it goes away for a few hours when I am concentrating at work or cooking. The doctor has prescribed me a very low dose of gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day to help with the tingling. I have also tried scheduling a neurologist appointment but the latest available is in August. 

With all things considered I know that I won't find out more until I get that MRI done.

15,AskDocs,"Hi! I apologize ahead of time if you find run-on sentences or all over the place information- I'm tired after a 12 hour shift lol. 

I've (24F) recently noticed that I am always so forgetful to the point of genuine concern. I will be having a conversation with someone, get distracted for 5 seconds with something around me, and I will forget what I was talking about and would have to ask the person what we were just talking about. I work in healthcare and I find it often that I have to go back at times and ask my patients, ""I'm sorry if I already asked this but xyz?"". Anytime someone speaks to me, I can never sustain attention, so information basically goes into one ear and out the other. Yesterday, I had an appointment w/ my dermatologist and the entire time she was consulting me with information pertaining to a diagnosis, the words could not stick to my brain. This resulted in a super blanked out stare at my derm and she went ""don't worry, I'll send out a message with everything I just said"". The inattentiveness occurs a lot especially when I am focused on one thing and am no longer aware of other things surrounding me. I can be busy charting and will not respond to someone dropping a coffee mug right behind me (happened a few weeks ago). I feel like it's put a lot of strain at work since it's so difficult for me to recall the smaller details. It's a whole lot of ""I remember being told to do something, but I can't remember what it is exactly"". 

I have discussed this with my PCP already, and she referred me to a psychiatrist specializing in ADHD (that appointment never happened because they wanted to speak to someone who can advocate my symptoms during my childhood. I did not feel comfortable authorizing anyone to discuss my medical info). Now I am wondering if I should actually be seeing a neurologist instead of a psychiatrist? Or maybe I should continue to pursue seeing a psychiatrist (my EPO insurance allows me to seek out mental health without referrals). If it's a psychiatrist, is there a certain psychiatrist I should seek out? 

Thank you!

History - 5’6, 145lbs, perfectly healthy childhood/teenage years. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 19yo, diagnosed agoraphobic with panic disorder at 21yo, and later diagnosed Bipolar 2 at 24yo (last summer). I have had weight fluctuations of 70+ pounds in either direction over the past 3 years (no medication or dieting). Over the last year, I went on many different APs that didn’t work, and had a toxic reaction to Lithium last December (2022). I took a beta blocker to help with the tremor until my PCP advised me to stop last month. Currently, I take 10mg Baclofen 2x/day to help with symptoms because Flexeril didn’t work.

The main symptom started out as mild face twitching near my brow and within weeks progressed to full on, painful half face spasms that can last up to a minute. Headaches have gotten worse and so has my since of balance. Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen both don’t help. 

Bloodwork has come back clear with the exception of a slightly elevated anion gap (19). CT of sinuses is clear if that matters.

21,AskDocs,"Hello ,

This is about my wife:

Caucasian female, 5’2”, 130lbs.

Regular drinker, no drugs or tobacco.

My wife is a RN in a med surge unit in a large hospital.

COVID was particularly rough for her and she finally agreed to therapy after very dark depressive episode in late 2022/early 2023.

She is seeing both a psychiatrist and therapist and was prescribed lexapro 10mg/day. It was upped to 20mg last Wednesday.

She’s napping a lot now. She’s never napped before. We’ve been married 6/together 10, and I can count on one hand the number of naps of I’ve seen her take a nap before. She’s doubled that number in a week. She says she feels foggy. If I didn’t know better I’d swear she was on something or drunk. I tried going on a walk with her today but she was just too tired even though she’s been off work and getting like 10 hrs of sleep. 

She called off work today. The only time she called off before was when she literally had COVID. 

Today she went back to 10mg of the lexapro and sent a message to her psych via the patient portal but we haven’t heard back yet. She started the 10mg 3 months ago and no issues but thought it wasn’t working. 

Part of her agreeing to getting help is a no questions asked policy about it. I drive her to the appointments and she keeps a lot of it to herself. That way I know she’s going and she gets to do this at her own pace. Which I’m fine with but I’m in the dark about these meds.

37,AskDocs,"24Y male. No issues health wise except mild asthma and SVT that’s well controlled. 

Two days ago (4/17) my stomach started hurting. Not bad pain, just uncomfortable. Like a bad stomach ache. Ignored it as it started late at night and I fell asleep. Woke up the next day (4/18) and the feeling is there but now is more actual spurts if legit pain. Like I went to my knees at one point when it felt like a was being stabbed randomly. 

Then through the day the pain got better. But I noticed that when having a bowel movement, the pushing motion made the lower right quadrant hurt like hell. I couldn’t use the bathroom for an hour until the Tylenol I took started to work. Also noticed a low grade fever (100.5) at this time. Started getting nausea and vomited a few times as well. No appetite either. I have a kidney stone in my right kidney so I thought that could be the cause. 

My mom convinces me to go to the er and get checked out. We go and immediately are put in a room and they’re thinking appendicitis as well. Pain and nausea meds and a CT later and no obvious signs of appendicitis. They said a lot of stool in my intestines that can mimic appendicitis pain. 

While being discharged the PA treating me comes back into my room alone and tells me to watch the pain and if the bentyl they prescribed doesn’t help to come back. She said I wouldn’t be the first to leave like this to come back a day or two later with true appendicitis. 

Am I thinking too much into what the PA said at the end? Maybe she suspected it really was appendicitis and her MD didn’t? Also they’re was was issue with them verifying my insurance. They kept getting a connection error. The registration lady said she knew it would be good and covered, but the hospital has to treat me as self pay until it’s verified, which it wasn’t at that point. 

I’ve been home about twelve hours and slept about ten of those. Woke up feeling overall terrible, still tender where they pushed on my abdomen. Fever also got to 102 before Tylenol I took a bit ago. 

What do I do? I don’t wanna go back and make a deal out of this if I’m fine and it’s a stomach bug, but I’m also afraid of something happening and me getting worse.

It was the third time of it happening that I clearly remember despite the short term memory loss from ECT treatments… it’s horrifying waking up before the paralytic has worn off; people standing over your body and you can’t move or speak (history of sexual abuse makes this worse); two of the three times I felt like I was choking on my spit and they kept telling me to take a deep breath through the oxygen they were giving me and then I was back asleep until I woke up normally in recovery. 


The psychiatrist in charge of my procedures noted this in my chart as an anomaly all. four. times. I’m fairly certain once or twice is an anomaly; it should NOT keep happening. They do this at a cancer center that has plenty of anesthesiologists trained in many types of procedures available so he should not keep using the brevitol. I’m supposed to do two more months of weekly then bi-weekly treatments but I will not consent if he won’t change to a different anesthetic. Even without a history of sexual trauma; waking up too early with your body paralyzed and multiple people standing over you is traumatizing in itself.

39,AskDocs,"This past Saturday, I (30F white) started having this gnawing annoying pain in my upper abdomen by my ribs, dead center where my esophagus begins I believe. It annoyed me almost all day until the evening. I came home, ate dinner, noticed the pain was subsiding, and went on about my weekend happily.

I did a 24 hour fast (for religious purposes) and came home and ate dinner. Felt fine, albeit maybe slightly unsettled afterwards. Yesterday, I began to notice that my appetite wasn’t that great and any time I’d go to eat something, I’d feel somewhat nauseous and couldn’t finish my food. Today, I couldn’t really eat at all and the pain from Saturday is back except it isn’t as severe. My stools look normal and I’m not running any sort of fever.

41,AskDocs,"Hey all. I (19M) have been suffering from hypothesized chronic exertional compartment syndrome bilaterally in the anterior and lateral compartments of my lower legs since May of 2022. I’ve seen four orthopedists, and all agree on the diagnosis given that all imaging/tests conducted have been negative (three MRIs collectively lasting 6 hours, two ultrasounds, CT scan, nerve conduction study, prob some others I’m forgetting) so something like popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is ruled out. Have also seen a neurologist and vascular surgeon to cover all my bases.


I experience symptoms from even moderate walking, so it is a serious detriment to my quality of life as a college student. Haven’t been able to walk to class really at all the last two semesters - have been relying on the college disability service vans which are nice but would love to get around on my own. I’ve also tried physical therapy, acupuncture, and deep tissue massage - they did nothing or even made it worse. Been eyeing a fasciotomy for quite a few months since that seems like the only thing that could help. I cleared a 6-week period this summer where I don’t have any classes so I have time to recover. However, since my condition is bilateral, I eventually need both legs done.


I would really like to get both legs done at the same time since if all goes well, I could return to normal life in the fall. Two of the orthopedists say doing both legs is reasonable, and the other two highly caution against it. There shouldn’t be a difference in cost for two separate surgeries versus the one due to my insurance workings, but I would love to get both done at the same time if it’s feasible. I know it’s probably not going to be comfortable, just asking if it’s doable (like will I have the strength to go to the bathroom by myself, can I get out of a car w/o a wheelchair, etc.).

Over the past few (3ish) years my fainting spells have come back and I'm  trying to write them down now. I used to faint in college regularly. I used to be a heavy marijuana user and didn't drink enough water, eat healthy, so I chalked it up to that. But when I say regularly, there was a time in college when I couldn't sit up from lying down without fainting unless I took it very, verrrrrry slow.

I went a few years and was fine but now it has started again. I've written down as much as I can remember. Do you have any idea what might be causing this (I had an ultrasound on my heart as well as an ekg and both came back ""textbook normal"" per the doctor). I'm curious if this is normal. Also what kind of details to record to bring to a doctor.

December 2022:

Time of day: began around 2:30

Two drinks (pina coladas), split a mofungo with skirt streak

After walking outside, I suddenly felt extremely nauseous, light headed, body felt like jelly, I personally felt very hot but NOT hot to the touch, acid reflux, some burping, fast heartbeat, body felt shaky, sensation of tight clothing (my buttoned shorts) was very uncomfortable, any weight on stomach or chest (even my own hand felt uncomfortable)

I felt that if I didn't lie down, I'd pass out or throw up

Had to lie down. When i could get to a batnroom, i then had diarrhea. At that point if I stood up too fast I saw stars/got really dizzy and was worried I'd pass out.

Whole thing lasted about two hours (when I stayed seated or lying down) then another hour of lingering effects (some dizziness, body felt weak/like jello)

55,AskDocs,"22F. One of my wisdom teeth is, in the doctor’s words, “slightly infected”. It’s causing some moderate jaw pain that’s been easily managed with ibuprofen. I’m getting it and another one removed next week. Doc said to only start antibiotics two days before the surgery so I’m not taking those yet. 

I am so exhausted and weak today. I have a history of hypothyroidism, anemia, an eating disorder, and severe depression (all being managed with medication right now), so I feel like I know fatigue pretty well. This tiredness is really extreme and seems strange in the absence of any other symptoms except the jaw pain. I don’t have a fever or literally any other symptoms. Just the toothache from a “slightly infected” wisdom tooth and the exhaustion.

Is this normal? It’s making it really hard to function. If it’s just a normal symptom of tooth infection I’m considering pushing the surgery up.

Complaint: Male who presents with chronic bilateral neck pain, right upper extremity C6/7 radiculopathy. He has previously been in physical therapy continues daily HEP for the past multiple months with little relief. He uses ibuprofen with little relief. He has previously had cervical epidural multiple years ago with 100% relief of his symptoms for over a year. MRI cervical 2/3/2023 images/report reviewed demonstrates C5/6 moderate central stenosis, C6/7 bilateral severe foraminal stenosis, multiple disc protrusions.

Doctor has booked a C5-C7 ACDF for 5/11.

Questions before diatribe;

* How does one go about getting a second opinion? PPO so I don't need referrals. Do I just call up another practice and say I'm looking for a second opinion? Should I start in the same physician group or is it best to go elsewhere?
* What kind of doctor would I look for? I'm aware of the specialists who treat this but is there a specific one which might have more insight.

As soon as I felt the pain come back in my arm in December knew exactly what it was, as I had the same thing in 2018. At the time a cervical epidural worked perfectly but was only c6-7 with a problem and obviously has progressed significantly. Tried the conservative treatment again this time but didn't work.

I came in to this expecting to need surgery but went from going back to the surgeon and having surgery booked in about 5 minutes with no opportunity to ask questions. He did say I would have an opportunity to ask questions at a pre-surgical visit in a couple of weeks.

Usually I don't let my mental health diagnosises get in the way and they are very well managed but flustering when bombarded by information like this is one of them. I usually think through anxiety and get to why which settles it down but in this case im struggling as I don't understand why it's a fusion rather than a disc replacement. At an early meeting he said he prefers fusions as disc replacements usually calcify.

Hello, everyone. I am 22\[M\], 5'1, 110 lbs, Asian, and my primary complaint is should I be worried about contracting HIV through my encounter that I described below and if my current yeast infection has anything to do with it?

So, to give you some background information, I'll start off with that I do have the tendency to over react and escalate situations when they perhaps don't need to be escalated. I often let my anxiety overwhelm me and influence my decisions. I'm sorry in advance if my thought process was a little silly, logically, I know I might have overreacted

About three weeks ago, I wanted to hook-up with someone. I don't hook-up very often as in the past it has always freaked me out. Someone I used to hook-up with on Grindr initiated and asked if I wanted to do anything. I obliged but I let him know that I'm currently waiting to try and get PReP at my next healthcare appointment and would not be comfortable doing oral or anal sex with him until I can get access to it. He agreed and we participated in kissing, mutual masturbation, but where he caught me off guard was when he tried to rub my anus. After realizing, I pushed his fingers away and let him know that I wasn't comfortable with that. He said okay and we proceeded and that was that, I had a decent time.

But, as my brain does every time I have ever had any sexual contact with someone, it overthought. What if his fingers had precum on them and it went through my anus? What if he was HIV+ (I asked these questions prior, he said he was HIV negative, but got tested three months ago and had on and off again hook-ups with or without condoms in the past three months so I told him, definitely no oral or anal sex then). So, consumed in my anxiety and regret I went to my local urgent care and talked to someone about what just happened. They recommended that I didn't need PEP per se because my exposure was extremely limited, but they prescribed it to me anyway (Truvada once daily and Isentress 400mg twice daily). I started PEP within 20 hours and I have been taking it for the past three weeks. For the past three weeks, I have been freaking out and going into the cyclical mindset of: did I really get HIV from that encounter? I don't have it? I do have it. Is the medication even working? Did I even need the medication?

Fast forward to this morning. I woke up and was getting ready to brush my teeth when I noticed this weird sticky white/clear gooey substance on my lower lip and lower lip only. I peeled it off and it had like, the consistency of AquaPhor (which, I haven't been using in a while). I asked my sister what it was and she said she thinks it's a yeast infection and prescribed me with fluconazole. I contacted a nurse if there were going to be drug interactions and if it was safe with my PEP and she said there were no drug interactions so it was safe to take. (If this helps, the nurse asked me if I felt any pain, if there was any canker sores, if there was anything on my tongue, the answers to all those questions are no)

But, then I went into a rabbit hole of research. And, of course, I saw that a yeast infection can come from HIV and now I'm spiraling down a really deep hole of anxiety. So, I guess what I'm asking is, is it likely that I contracted HIV from my initial encounter and did I need PEP in the first place? Additionally, is my yeast infection just an unfortunate coincidence that likely comes from something unrelated and is not a sign of acute HIV? Oh, PS, the gooey substance came back on my lower lip in the evening

TL;DR: I had a brief hook-up with someone with an unknown HIV status that didn't involve anal or oral but involved a brief massage to my anus. I took PEP as soon as I could within 20 hours but three weeks later, I think I have a yeast infection (white gooey stuff that I personally thought was just an oral mucosa peeling). Should I start panicking?

That is my story and my thoughts.

77,AskDocs,"So my main question is in the title. I’d really appreciate more in depth advice abt what’s going on w my health. I know this is long but I’m struggling. 

I’m having neck pain in what feels like my c1. The whole right side of my neck and head hurt. There is a bump/knot on the right side of whatever vertebrae this is. It’s on the right of my c1/c2 I *think*. I’ve been feeling really sick for three months and can’t figure it out. I’ve had a CBC, thyroid, and metabolic panel but no other tests. An mri of the brain and a CT scan of my abdomen. They found a sclerotic lesion in my hip. I had to go to the er a few weeks ago bc I had SVT: I was relaxing and felt my heart start to pound and skip beats, I got sweaty and lightheaded, then my pulse shot up to 180bpm for a half hour. I thought I was dying so I went to the er. I was given an ekg, chest X-ray, and ct scan of my abdomen. They kept me overnight bc my troponin levels were rising. I was released w a ZIO patch and have to see a cardiologist in a few weeks. That’s when they saw the sclerotic lesion. I really need help; I feel horrible.

My symptoms are synonymous w a brain tumor, Lyme disease, or something nasty. I’m losing weight, dizzy, lightheaded, muscle weakness, and vertigo. I have pain on the right side of my neck/head, behind my right eye, and my eye itself. I have pulsatile tinnitus: I can hear my blood pumping w my pulse. Sometimes it’s a swooshing noise, sometimes it’s static, sometimes my ears feel/sound plugged. It’s constant and more pronounced in my right ear. When I stand up, I get lightheaded and dizzy. If I don’t bend down and I try to keep walking, my spine will tingle down to my tailbone and my legs get weak. I can push thru it w/o falling but my legs shake.

I had an mri of my brain/brain stem w no findings. “Mild mucosal thickening right maxillary sinus” was the only remark. My right ear canal is very sore/feels raw: I can’t put a qtip in there. I can clean my left ear and it feels good, if I try to do my right ear, it feels like the qtip has razor blades on it. Idk how long that’s been happening, at least 3 months. Pain on the right side of my neck, my right temple, and around my right eye. The chiro I saw said “my c1 has shifted to the right”. It definitely *feels* like that, there’s a hard bump or knot on the right side of my c1/c2. The neurologist said that’s not possible. He saw my MRI. I asked if I should go to an ent and he said no. I’m hoping I can get some advice here, where do I go, what should I do? I feel like I have to advocate for my own health to my doctors bc they aren’t making any suggestions but I’m like DEBILITATED.

Relevant meds: occurs with different antibiotics 


I had what I now know is ALEP/AGEP from amoxicillin about 7 years ago, when I was in my early 20s after being able to take it without an issue my entire life. 

Since then I have seemingly developed sensitivity and get an ALEP rash after taking multiple different antibiotics including clindamycin, cefpodoxime, cefdinir (more mild than the other antibiotics) and most recently doxycycline. Some antibiotics I’ve developed this rash taking it for the first time (no prior exposure) and others I’ve taken before without an issue but then develop this rash, which is what happened with clindamycin, cefdinir,amoxicillin, and doxycycline. 

Every time I’ve gotten this rash it’s tiny pimple like pustules mostly on my face, neck, chest, shoulders and sometimes back. From my understanding it’s rare for this type of reaction to happen from just one medication, let alone several. Why is this happening with different antibiotics and is there any way i can become desensitized? Is there anything underlying that could be causing this?

I’ve had a weird feeling in my right abdomen since January. I have a suspicion that it came after a course of antibiotics for a cat bite. It comes and goes but there are instances where it is extremely noticeable:

•When driving, my seatbelt causes me to be very aware of my right side.
•When lying down, it is sometimes noticeable.
•After driving for a while (I’m a delivery driver for work) the feeling is there when standing and sitting.
•And (this probably goes without saying due to my mental conditions) it seemingly seems to worsen and become more noticeable the more I think about it.

I’ve also recently begun working out very recently and abdominal exercise I think has caused me to be hyper conscious of my abs.

Timeline of events:

3/19/23 - Dull pain in my upper right abdomen and back after spaghetti dinner. 
3/20/23 - pain worsens (9/10) and I go into the ER in the early morning hours. Nauseous as well. Ultrasound is negative for stones. Lab work WNL. Chest and back radiographs all normal. Pregnancy/STD negative. Sent home on course of antibiotics in case it’s early urinary infection. 
3/22/23 - Pain and nausea worsens again after being dull on Tuesday (after eating pork chops). Yellow diarrhea. Goes to Urgency Room. Ultrasound clear for stones, Labwork WNL, CT scan normal. Given IV fluids for dehydration and Diludid for pain while in clinic. Discharged with Zofran for nausea and Oxycodone for pain. 
3/25/23 - Develops low grade fever. Still nauseous, not eating much and yellow diarrhea. Calls primary doctor hotline. Advised to go back in to ER. Goes to ER. Doctor was very unhelpful. Refused to do any testing or give me IV fluids or pain/nausea meds. Says it’s either a muscle strain or menstrual cramps. Discharged while crying and begging for help. 
3/27/23 - Primary doctor - refers me to HIDA scan. Fills Zofran and Vicodin as needed until scan date. 
3/28-4/10 - Uses Zofran 1-3x a day, used Vicodin PRN (not much, maybe every few days), cuts out dairy, caffeine and meat. Mostly living off English Muffins or Vegan Chicken Tenders. Anytime I try something else the pain comes back for hours. Yellow stools, solid. 
4/10 - HIDA scan - results given to me on 4/17 - 76.4% 

The pain continues when I eat. Severity and how long it lasts depends on what I eat. Mostly goes away when not eating. When I eat it worsens and can get very sharp. (I experienced the same sharp feeling and nausea when getting the CCK of the scan). 

I don’t have diarrhea but the yellow stools remain. 

I am working and exercising and the pain does not worsen with either of those activities so I’m suspicious still of GI/gallbladder. 

My cousin had an emergency gallbladder removal on 4/10 and I did a family check, we have 5 people with removals/issues of gallbladder. I’d like to avoid the position of being where Laura was and having it become emergent if this is the issue.

94,AskDocs,"My friend hadls a at home blood sugar tester (Dario). Which she got from Amazon. 
Just out of curiosity I figured I'd check mine too. So I washed my hands, replaced the lancet ( the needle thingy) inserted the test stirip and added a drop of blood. 

The first test showed 397 mg/dl. I thought that was odd. 

Tested again 9 mins later it showed 445 mg/dl

I waited an hour and half and test again and it shows 392 mg/dl. 

This was immediately concerning. My friend is saying I need to go to ER right now. 



I feel no symptoms. No fatigue, no nausea, lightheadedness, blurred vision etc. I'm sincerely concerned should I be going to ER ASAP or should I wait untill tomorrow morning and test again after fasting the night? Is it actually diabetes? 

For background- prior to 3 hrs before test I had an egg salad sandwich. Then me and my friend were drinking I had 3 whiskey sodas. 

I don't eat a lot of sugar or anything sweet. I tend to like bitter more than sweet.
 I work in a high stress environment and have been struggling with sleep issues for couple of years.
 My urine is usually clear but last few days it's been translucent to dark yellow. 
I don't eat meat except breakfast meat only on the weekends. 
I consume 2-3 drinks a day (red wine, brandy, bourbon).
 I smoke cigars 2 time a week. ( Friday night and Sunday afternoon)

Medications - 

I'm on wellbutrin 150 MG once every morning
Lamotrigine 100 MG once every morning
Trazodone 50 MG once every night

The few days after my period it dips as low as 40 when sitting(asymptomatic) and down to 38 when sleeping per my apple watch. I know athletes can have a low resting heart rate but I am overweight and don't have the best endurance. So I don't know that my resting HR is due to my athleticism. I had an EKG, echo and halter monitor and everything can back normal.

I'm not sure if this is related but I think I have episodes of hypoglycemia. I felt dizzy, palptations and anxious/panicky at work one day. I drank a whole Powerade and 2 apple juices which helped a lot. After about 30 minutes, I had my blood sugar checked and it was 100. So I have to imagine before I had 75g of sugar it was probably on the lower end of normal or low in general. I've been very anxious lately but I haven't been able to pinpoint the source. It feels random and untriggered but eating or drinking a sugary drink helps within 10 minutes. I'm not sure if I'm stress eating or if my blood sugar is out of wack.

106,AskDocs,"Hi! So bit of back story. I am disabled from a car accident from 2012. Currently have a spinal cord stimulator implant from March 2020. I got covid August 2022. After I continued feeling awful, horrible headaches to the point I was wearing sunglasses in doors, complete and total exhaustion, like sleeping 18+ hours and not feeling rested. I still have no taste or sleep. Despite being sick I was going weight and had a lot of hair loss. In November I went to a primary care doctor. I haven't seen a primary care doctor in a really long time. I got really turned off from doctors after the car accident, I was fairly young and LOOKED ok and no one wanted to listen or be involved. I can't tell you how many doctors offices I left in the months following the accident I left just sobbing from the experience.


Anyway I visited a PC who I absolutely love. She did blood work and a brain ct to make sure nothing else was going on. I have a couple of that if needed, but basics were b12 and vit d were severely deffecient. My tsh was pretty high. I believe it was 18ish then. The head ct was all clear. She immediately started me on levothyroxine and did the full thyroid panel. I did bi weekly b12 injections for 3 months and oral supplements after and oral vit d supplements also. By the time we did the next blood work my tsh was 24ish. She raised my dose and sent me a referral to a endo. 

I saw the endo in January. My tsh had come down but not enough so we did another dose raise. I saw her again last week and it only came down from 8 8 to 7.7. I'm now at 88 mcg. She says we are being extra careful with upping the dose because I naturally have a high heart rate (resting is around 100, it's been like that almost my whole life) and if I flipped hyper it could be very dangerous. When we do the next round of blood work she also wants to check for lupus. I saw my PC yesterday for a 3 month checkup and she did another round of blood work. Just about a month ago my 14 year old went into unknown to us dka, and has since been diagnosed as type 1 diabetic. Because it was so severe we had our 2 younger children also check. 13 yo came back with a a1c of 5.7, but glucose level was good, positive for thyroid antibodies, but tsh was good. 12 yo came back with tsh 17 and high thyroid antibodies. So endo referrals they both got but we're still waiting for their appointments.


So with all this going on my PC wanted to check everything she could. I got the blood work back but I probably won't hear from her for a few days if not next week.  I'm mostly wondering about the high potassium low ish sodium, and the cholesterol results. Specifically how can the total cholesterol be good but the others not. 


.info and meds are:
37f, 138 lbs., oxycodone 7.5/325, baclofen 10mg, levothyroxine 88mcg, b12 25mcg, vit d 125mcg. I have a spinal cord stimulator no other surgeries or hospitalizations. The muscle relaxer and pain meds have been the same dose for a couple years, only new additions is the levo increase. 

Thank you!!

Any existing relevant medical issues previous dx of PCOS at the time of scan. Have since been diagnosed with Spondyloarthritis, anemia of chronic disease 

Current medications had hormonal IUD at the time and sometimes took acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Now currently take Humira for a few months, Celecoxib as needee, and metformin ER for PCOS/insulin resistance. 

My CRP and ESR are typically very elevated due to arthritis. 

I went to the ER awhile back with left side pelvic pain. I do normally experience painful periods and cramping, as well as pelvic pain between periods and abnormal bleeding which is what led to my workup for PCOS. This was sharper and more severe than my normal pain and I was afraid my IUD had perforated. 

They did an ultrasound and found a simple cyst on my left ovary. The doctor thought this was the cause of the pain and gave some pain medication. I do not recall them mentioning anything about a possible mass or following up with my doctor (that doesn’t mean they didn’t, I was very tired and painful and may not be recalling that part)

It’s been some time now and I found this in the report on MyChart. I do have a gynaecologist appointment in a few months and I haven’t seen one since this scan, but in the meantime for my own peace of mind I was hoping a doctor could chime in on this and what the possibilities are (I would love to be told it’s probably nothing) 

Is this likely to be a mass, and if so what could it represent? They mention small bowel loop as a possibility but from my understanding this would be causing bowel symptoms or a blockage. I haven’t experienced anything like that in the year since this happened. Is it normal for regular bowel to show up this way on ultrasound? 

I do still regularly get pelvic pain, sometimes it is similar to the sharper pain I had that night or sometimes just feels like my “normal” pain, but I’ve been brushing it off as more cysts or just the same pain I’ve always had. 

I understand it’s harder to give an opinion without the images but unfortunately I only have access to the radiology report. I apologise for the length of this post, just trying to give any possibly important context. Thank you in advance!

115,AskDocs,"I'm a 32 year old female, 5'2"" 125lbs currently taking Carafate, Omeprazole, and Allegra. I don't smoke or drink, no use of recreational drugs. I have been complaining about pain in my lower right abdominal area but have not been diagnosed with anything yet. I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy scheduled for next week. I have had my tonsils and appendix removed, recently was told that my most recent pap showed HPV, and for the last year and a half have been getting sick every month but otherwise I have no other known health issues.


 Around March 20th I noticed a series of red patches at the back of my throat forming. They didn't really bother me but about a week afterward I started feeling really sick. Fevers, lots of sneezing, runny nose, some white dots at the back of my throat, etc. On day ten I went to my doctor who said she though it was an upper respiratory infection. I tested negative for strep and covid. Had a telehealth appt with another doctor about a week later who thought my symptoms presented as allergies and not a URI. He told me to start taking allergy meds, which I did, and I put an air purifier and cool air humidifier in my room. I went back to my doctor during week 3 and we retested for strep and covid: still negative. Also tested for mono and that came back negative as well. Went to an urgent care doctor some time after who thought maybe it could be oral thrush since I told him I have GI issues but I had also coincidentally seen my dentist around that time and he never mentioned thinking I had oral thrush so I didnt take the medicine prescribed. I went to the ER this weekend and told them I'd been sick for almost a month and that I was feeling shortness of breathe and heaviness in my chest, the white spots were not really noticeable at that point but the rash in the back of my mouth was still there. They did a chest X-ray that showed what they thought were several granulomas around my lungs but otherwise nothing of note. All my blood work came back relatively normal.  My urine tests were abnormal, showing an infection, but there was no bacterial growth in the culture so they didn't think it was a UTI. I'll post a pic of the results of both. I don't think they felt it was relative to whatever is going on with this continued illness so we never discussed what that could mean. I told the ER NP that saw me about the white spots that were no longer very visible (there is a very angry looking one where my left tonsil used to be) but he didn't think it looked too bad. He said he thought it could be allergies and went about the route that the telehealth doctor went. I went and saw my normal doctor on Monday and we discussed the possibility of me having an autoimmune disorder and potentially beginning to screen for cancers but she didn't take a look at the back of my throat. I was feeling relatively better in the sense that walking wasn't making me feel winded quite as much but yesterday I made the mistake of standing in 67 degree weather and having a conversation with a coworker in the shade and my lungs felt super distressed. I felt like I couldn't even talk afterwards. I woke up with a stiff neck and headache, which I attributed to the stress of still being sick but in case it's not I'll mention it here. I made an appointment with an ENT specialist for next Monday but I feel terrible, with no resolution in sight, and I'm feeling pretty defeated by the medical system. I have been waiting forever to see this GI specialist and I'm almost positive that my procedures are going to get pushed back thanks to my lungs. Any ideas out there what this could be? Or maybe how to speak to my medical providers about my concerns? I have been taking vitamin c and zinc trying to push this out of my system, using a steam inhaler-humidifier thing and occasionally salt water gargles.

I (31F) noticed this darker spot under my nail about 3-4 days ago and I am wondering what it is/could be. It seemingly came out of nowhere. It DOES hurt a bit when pressure is applied. Also, the white part of the nail has this translucency like it is wet even when it is not. (The pronounced vertical line running up the nail and the odd growth shape are due to the nail getting smashed in a door when I was a child.)

I have no recollection of hitting my finger or dropping something on it, though I often get hurt without noticing so it being a bruise is not out of the question. On the other hand, I'm wondering if it isn't a fungus. I usually wear gel nail polish; however, I try to give my nails a break often and haven't worn any nail polish for about 6 weeks (and the spot wasn't there before this oast week as far as i recall.)

127,AskDocs,"So I'm 22F, on Dexedrine and Tizanidine and I get Aimovig monthly. I've had blood drawn 2-4 times a month for the past 6 months, usually 8-12 vials of it. I always feel MUCH healthier after having a lot of blood drawn.

I went in for blood and urine screening today. I'm not dehydrated, I drink a LOT of water. I've always had good veins, but for the past couple months, when they try to draw blood, it's... difficult. The phlebotomist will try to stick me, she'll get a few drops in the vacuum bottles and it stops. They'll reposition the needle, take it out and try another vein/arm, try different needle types, etc. They often need 2 lab techs just to get a sample. A couple months ago they just had to try several times, but now they can't get the vacuum tubes to work AT ALL. 

So they have to use a syringe to manually pull the blood out, then they inject it into the various tubes for tests.

I've seen several doctors for severe fatigue and lower leg weakness over the past few months. I generally can't walk much due to spasticity, but I move around and stretch all day. I have lost 40lbs in a couple months (I'm 5'9"", around 135lbs now). I make myself eat, but still losing weight. Doctors are concerned but limited in their capacity, I've got a primary doc and I've seen 3 neurologists, endocrinology, and rheumatology. 

Things that usually pop up in lab work are high blood protein, elevated RBC. HCT and platelets are always high. Blood calcium has been high for years but TSH is normal. 

I'm usually mildly tachycardic (120-140bpm when sitting), and I've had low diastolic BP lately (regular systolic so the numbers are usually around 110/55 or so).

On brain MRIs, I have about 10 white matter hyperintensities and a 9mm cerebellar herniation without syrinx. They haven't explained the WMH to me, a year ago I only had a couple.


Doctors are saying labs aren't crazy enough to explain symptoms, they say it's a ""very unclear etiology"". They've been looking at very specific neuromuscular diseases.

129,AskDocs,"29, male, white, 6 foot 1--longstanding mild anemia with no obvious cause.

Just got CBC results with the lowest results I've had...

RBC 4.12 (Range 4.20-6.0)

Hgb 13.0 (Range 12.5-17.5)

HCT 37.8 (Range 38.0-52.0)

White Blood cells, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RBC are all totally normal. Full results here: [CBC Results](https://imgur.com/a/bipd5TL)

For the last five years I've had RBC results in the 4.12-4.40 Range, Hgb in the 13.0-14.0 range, and HCT in the 37.8-41.0 Range.

The doctors don't know what's causing this. They say it's nothing to worry about since my other CBC results are so normal, but I'm concerned. I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy which came back normal. My iron, TIBC, Transferrin levels were normal (middle of the ref range). I eat a healthy diet (plenty of vegetables and fish), and I have no symptoms of anemia.

I do have low Vitamin D and I have been taking Omeprazole for 2 months due to dyspepsia (my doctor thinks this is due to anxiety as my stomach looks fine). I have a lot of anxiety in general and health anxiety in particular.

Any idea what could be causing these low numbers? I was okay with them being at the low end of the range, but with this last test they are now below the range--so I'm worried they are dropping. I'm of course worried about some sort of serious underlying disease or condition.

Are there any other helpful blood tests I could request? How soon can I get my CBC tested again, and is there anything I can do to boost my red blood cell numbers?

Pain radiating throughout the whole front of my chest. Then the pain moved up and down my esophagus.

**EBV VCA IgM 135.0 (0-35.9) HIGH**

**EBV Early Antigen IgG &lt;5 (0-8.9) Normal**

**EBV Nuclear Antigen IgG 218.0 (0-17.9) HIGH**

With *slightly* high white blood cell count, but still in the range of normal.

Which I treated as a reactivated EBV. Resolved itself in about two months. Got back to the gym (I lift heavy), everything was fine. But I notice every time I travel, which has been often, I get colds/sick way more easily. In addition, I simply can't drink anymore, or stay out late, etc. I feel like a fragile child with my immune system. I eat impeccably or as close to it as possible (meal prep), drink fluids, try to get as much sleep as possible. 

Fast forward to March 2023. I believe I get COVID again--never tested. Once the initial symptoms resolve itself (3 weeks--chest, cold, fatigue, weird digestion, etc), I am slammed again with tiredness and I get tested April 7 for EBV reactivation.

Again, numbers are:

**EBV VCA IGM 116 (HIGH)**

**EBV VCA IgG 51 (HIGH)**

Again, with *slightly* high white blood cell count. All my other blood work looks great.

My doctor said to not worry about it, and that my spleen isn't inflamed (even though I feel like I feel it..), and continue with what I was doing (resting, vitamins, etc). I am at a loss. I am taking it easier, trying to relax, but worried this will follow me every time I get COVID? I had an extremely stressful 2021, and never, ever had this reactivation until COVID. And now two in less than a year. I've read so much on IgG levels, but no one seems to mention a steady iGM level issue....

I'd like to look on the bright side of this, I'm young and seemingly ""healthy"". I want to believe I won't get sick at the drop of the hat. But I just wondered if I was missing something, and if there's a reason these levels are persisting after months--thanks so much.

\*my lingering symptoms include fatigue more easily (I am someone who is constantly going/working/etc), chest pain while working out (already got this checked out, fine), and still that nagging pain under left rib (spleen?)",t2_9deuf2q8e,0,IGM EBV Reactivation--question.

137,AskDocs,"Hey there, first-time posted. Male, 35 years old, 5'10"", 155lbs. I'm very active (bike 50+ miles a week, jog, do yoga, surf, hike), and have no current medical issues.

My right ankle is veiny (see [photos](https://imgur.com/a/eWM7y1I)), and has looked like this for 4-5 years. I've never sprained or broken it, and my left ankle looks fine. Neither have ever given me any trouble, or feel painful at all. It just looks weird.

However, from time to time, I've taken off my shoes and people have asked me whether I sprained my ankle (apparently this is what it might look like?). I usually just shrug it off and say that it's not a problem, but this past weekend a friend  saw it and was more concerned than people have been in the past. 

So, my question is: is this something I need to be concerned about? Should I see a doctor about it? If so, what doctor should I even see?

All of these symptoms seem to match strep, however when I took a strep test yesterday, it came back negative. The doctor told me it was likely viral and to just give it time.

150,AskDocs,"Hello! Posting on behalf of a friend (29F) who fell on concrete yesterday and scraped up her knee and elbow pretty badly. I'll include a picture I took of her knee, there's a similar mark on her forearm near her elbow that's just a bit smaller. 

What we've done so far: cleaned it with soap and water and 70% isopropyl, then dressed it with gauze. She was having issues earlier today especially with the knee one, since it's on a bend point the skin gets stretched from everyday movement which is preventing a scab from forming. 

I'm just wondering if anyone here can give advice on the best way to dress it to prevent infection and scarring. We're considering getting some huge hydro-colloid bandages for it, but I don't know if that's recommended for such a huge area that's still weeping.

Occasionally I have pain and numbness. There has been no changes since it appeared; no crusting, oozing or scabbing. Sometimes it is more pale than other times, but it is always paler than the skin on my lips. No other flue like or cold symptoms. 

I've never had a cold sore before, but people in my family do have it, so when it first appeared I assumed this. I got cold sore ointment with in the second day of appearance, Abreva, and applied for 10 days as directed. No changes were noted.  At 6 weeks was able to see my primary care doctor. She admitted that they were unusual symptoms for a cold sore but said that was the most likely candidate for the cause. I was prescribed an antiviral, ValACYclovir and given a referral to see a dermatologist. 

I've finished the antiviral and still no changes. I have a referral to see a dermatologist and my appointment is 4 weeks out.

 Is it still possibly a cold sore? Is it possible for a cold sore to stay in the first stage and not progress for 7.5 weeks? What else? Thank you for reading!

Father is 76M with a history of heart problems (MI in his late 40s), high blood pressure, kidney disease, and colon polyps. Healthy weight. His father passed from colon cancer. Based in the US. 

In Oct last year he had serious bleeding that was diagnosed as diverticulosis that hospitalized him due to blood loss; they did an additional colonoscopoy (he had his preventative one earlier in the year) and found nothing concerning beyond the diverticulosis. They considered surgery, but determined it would resolve on its own. He was fine for a couple of months, and then it flared up again with another bleeding episode - Dr said clear fluids for a few days and allow it to heal, it did. Saturday, it flared again with another significant bleeding episode and Dr again advised clear liquids while it healed. By Tuesday he was still bleeding, and Dr ran blood test - HGB was 8.2 but he/my mother decided to get a good nights rest before heading to the hospital today.  This morning he was so weak he fell twice (I'm told no injuries), and HGB was 7.1.  He is now hospitalized and is being given 2 units of blood but after 8 hours in the ER he has yet to see a GI, and likely won't now until tomorrow morning. 

My concerns/questions are the following:

\-It concerns me that his Dr is letting him bleed to this point without intervention, is this normal practice?

\-He went 5 days without food, at Dr's advice. He did have some bone broth, but that seems like a very long time to not be recieving anything significant in terms of calories or nutrition, particuarly while he is bleeding so heavily. Is this normal advice, is it safe?

\-How might this impact his kidney disease? He is not yet on dialysis, but has been advised to begin the process to get on the donor registry so that if/when his numbers drop a bit more then he would be in line. I don't know much more than that.

\-Could this be something other than just diverticulosis that they're missing? His brother has had the same symptoms in the past year, but also recently diagnosed with a small pancreatic tumor.

\-Are there questions I should be asking him/my mother/his doctors to get more clarity on this? 

\-Is it fair to assume that if the ER is not rushing him to a doc, allowing him to wait until tomorrow to be seen, that its not wildly urgent? He is staying overnight at the hospital.

Any clarity or suggestions would be helpful as I'm 700 miles away and am trying my best not to stress my mother out more.

162,AskDocs,"Hi, I am wondering if anyone has thoughts about this. I have an ultrasound tomorrow afternoon but am very worried and want as much information as possible to best advocate for myself.

I’m 39 yo female, no significant medical history. Currently take 100mg doxycycline daily for alopecia. 

Two weeks ago, I developed tenderness on palpation of the lower cervical portion of my trachea. No pain when swallowing. I believe the pain was also on both sides of the trachea but I didn’t pay much attention.

Five days ago, the pain became localized to one spot in the area of the right thyroid. 

A few days later, I felt a small firm immobile discrete nodule develop in this area that was very tender when touched. I went to a doctor who suspected thyroiditis, but all thyroid labs returned normal. ESR was only mildly elevated at 30.

Since then, that nodule and tenderness has persisted, but today, one or two nodules - what I suspect to be lymph nodes - on the right side above the nodule (just lateral to the larynx) are enlarged. I’m a veterinarian so I palpate a lot of masses and lymph nodes.

Of course, you know that Google tells me that the only thing that causes a painful thyroidal nodule that progresses rapidly is anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

This clinical presentation does not appear to fit with SAT, papillary or follicular cancer, cyst, etc.

170,AskDocs,"I'm not exactly sure if I'm in the right sub for this, but it's the closest I could find.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year. Since the beginning, I've noticed he does this thing where he habitually clears his throat, or sort of twitches his head, but back when we first met it wasn't really noticeable. I didn't really even make note of it all to be honest.

About a month after we started dating, my dad asked if he had Tourette's, and though I replied no I feel like I've been more in tuned to things since then.

His head twitching episodes have gotten longer, with our friends even noticing him doing it while in class together. Most things he only does when we're alone and he relaxes more; he does a series of short, high pitched hums for anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds, during which he's like locked down and I can't get his attention at all. He taps things twice; when we're walking close to a wall, he'll occasionally tap it with his knuckle twice, or when he comes through the door he'll tap it with his foot twice before closing it.

Similarly, but much more severely, he'll have episodes where he majorly spaces out. This has began to impact his academic performance. I've timed it because I noticed it suddenly getting worse, and the longest episode I've timed was about 32 minutes. He just sits there, spaced out, staring at nothing. I shake him, and he'll just go ""Hm?"" even though he doesn't actually hear me. During this whole time he is also usually doing a quiet throat clear.

Most of these things are like small tics that he can't help but do. He'll come in through a door, space out for a second, then walk out through the door just to walk back in again. He'll close the door, then space out for a second, then reopen to close it again. When he calls someone, he presses their contact, then hangs up, then calls them again, then repeats this several times before actually letting the call ring. He will click his pen dozens of times before using it. He often lets out short bursts of breath.

This has begun to impact his grades. I notice most of these things don't really happen if he is in a large group or doing something that occupies his complete attention. It's like something has ALL of his attention or NONE at all.

Our teacher, who is very close to both of us and is a wonderful mother-like figure at out school, has severe ADHD and has spoken with him about seeing a doctor. My mom said she didn't notice anything until recently when he was spaced out with his head twitching during dinner. My dad said he's always noticed this stuff.

basically my problem is for the last 2-3 weeks I’ve been suffering with severe anxiety throughout the day and panic attacks and insomnia throughout the night mainly due to stress about college and finding an apprenticeship, I only mention this because I feel like I should point out I have done everything in my power to resolve the cause of my anxiety and insomnia (looking/applying for apprenticeships ect) but have been unsuccessful so I know that it is just a case of having to wait and see what happens now.

Until yesterday I tried to just work through it on my own with breathing  exercises ect but nothing was working so yesterday (Tuesday) morning I made an emergency appointment with my gp (general practitioner) and explained to her the issues I was having, she prescribed the propanolol for my anxiety/panic attacks and the phenergan for my insomnia, I do feel like the phenergan is somewhat working as it is sending me to sleep but I do still keep waking up through the night, for example yesterday the first pill I took was a propranolol this was as soon as I collected my prescription roughly 10:30am, I then came home from college around 4pm I had a bath, got changed ect and at about 5pm I took 1 of the phenergan pills after about 30min I fell asleep however i then woke up at around 00:30am and could not get back to sleep for about 30-45min so I took another of the phenergan as I had read the leaflet and it said that it was safe to take up to 50mg (2 pills per night) I also took another one of the propranolol pills because when I read the leaflet for that earlier in the day I saw that it completely wears of after around 8h and I had took my first one roughly 14h before that so i think that is why I kept waking up because the propranolol had wore off, so at this point it was some time around 1:30am and I fell back to sleep and didn’t wake up until 3:30pm today.

However even though I slept that long I can still remember waking up multiple times while I was asleep, obviously I will discuss all of this with my gp when I go back for a check up in the next week or so but I was just hoping to get some other opinions, I think that the phenergan that she gave me for my insomnia is working fine but I need a stronger anxiety medication because I have still been experiencing severe anxiety through the day, to be clear it isn’t as bad as it has been for the last couple of weeks but it is still very noticeably there, I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what medication could better treat my condition and also what would be the best way to suggest this to my gp (I don’t want to come across as one of those people that reads an article on the internet and thinks they know better than someone with x years of experience and training), any advise would be very much appreciated thank you in advance.",t2_rt1qtddd,0,Anxiety and insomnia prescription advice,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12seucc,True,ymxbgq,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12seucc/anxiety_and_insomnia_prescription_advice/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12seucc/anxiety_and_insomnia_prescription_advice/,475977,1681948152,0,,False,1681948169,1681948169,2023-04-19 23:49:12,,,

186,AskDocs," Hi. 

New here (27M, Swedish, roughly 230 lbs).

So my physiotherapist sent me go the doctor after they didn't know what was causing the cracking in my shoulders and shoulder blades when I move them (either when I roll them, lift them upwards or pull them backwards) but neither did the doctor I got to meet. Any ideas what might be causing it?

I can move my shoulders in shoulder blades indefinitely without it hurting and it cracks every single time. It does exhaust (if that makes sense?) my shoulders after a while however. My doctor asked her colleague who'd just told her ""it's normal""....

For reference, I've tried resistance training at the gym and at home for about half a year, after the physiotherapist game me some exercises and told me to be in touch a few months later if it didn't help (upon which they sent the appointment to the doctor). I, my friends and the doctor all feel something(s) moving when I crack the shoulders or shoulder blades as well.

I have been experiencing intense, constant aching hip and lower back pain on my left side for at least 6 to 9 months now. I thought it was general muscle weakness, but exercise exacerbated the pain too much so I had to stop. I tried glute bridges and felt physically unable to bring my left hip level to my right. Left side would collapse under my weight.

Now I just feel… lopsided. It’s hard to explain, When I sit down, it feels like I’m leaning toward the left, and I can really feel my “sit bone” in the left side, to the point where sitting on a hard surface hurts, which does not happen in my right leg. I constantly feel the urge to crack or pop my lower back on the right side, and I do it many times a day for relief, but sometimes it does not “pop” despite feeling like it needs to - sometimes it feels like my femur is being held out of place? My left quad feels rock hard and aches where my right is normal. And often, when standing, walking or even moving a certain way, I’ll feel a “snapping” sensation in the front of my hip. Physically my hip goes “in” more on the left side than the right - like I have a bigger hip dip there vs. none on the right. Recently it feels more and more stuck out of place, and I’m wondering if it’s possible to have a hip dislocated for 6+ months? 

If it’s relevant, my whole life I have experienced moments of excruciating hip pain when moving a slightly wrong way. The movements don’t cause it every time but sometimes lifting my leg up or standing etc will cause a twinge of 7/10 pain, I often feel my hip lose strength and kind of push out under my weight, when it happens I freeze and can’t focus on anything but the pain. But it only lasts for maybe 5-10 seconds before going away completely. 

I am on waiting for a PT appointment but it’s 3 months away. Same with my PCP to get an ortho referral. I don’t even know if this possible, but it’s disrupting my day to day and I’d like some insight while I wait to be examined.",t2_hrvwesh9,0,Can a hip be dislocated for many months without knowing?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12seek7,True,iseekaprophet,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12seek7/can_a_hip_be_dislocated_for_many_months_without/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12seek7/can_a_hip_be_dislocated_for_many_months_without/,475977,1681947150,0,,False,1681947165,1681947165,2023-04-19 23:32:30,,,
191,AskDocs,"Hello.

I am a 21 year old male and recently, I’ve been having to use the restroom (number 2) about once every two to three days. For the past week or so, I have felt very constipated and it would take a long time to finish using the restroom. Last week in particular, I had to pass a very hard and painful stool, and a little bit of blood was found on the toilet paper. I’ve had this happen from particularly rough stools in the past, but it was very rare for this to happen. However, since that incident last week, every time I use the restroom now it is very painful and also has small amounts of blood on the toilet paper. 

There is never any blood “pouring out” or any in the toilet bowl itself. The blood has always been bright red, just as if I were to cut my hand right now and see blood. I have not had any abdominal pain. 

Today however, I had another painful bowel movement and noticed that my stool had some (bright red) blood on it. Not covering the whole thing, but enough to see what was happening. It’s the first time this has actually happened, and I noticed it quickly because I’ve been keeping a much closer eye at my bowel movements ever since last week when it first started. 

Could it be that my anus had gotten injured from last week, and all the subsequent bowel movements have just made it worse/irritated it? Almost all of my stool has been very hard and painful since then, and usually only had very small amounts of blood seen on the toilet paper. 

I’m very sorry if this is gross (it is to me). I’m quite worried. After all of this has happened, you can bet I’m going to be eating much healthier and drinking a lot more water.

Well, I started noticing some tightness on my foreskin (back in january) and a white'ish ""ring"" when I tried to pull back the foreskin. Also, during sex I would feel a slight pain (probably because my foreskin was tight) and I would notice some really really small cuts only on the foreskin after. I did not feel itching or anything like that tho.

I decided to go to a doctor to see what this was, and he said it was lichen sclerosus. He did not explain much, only that having a circumcision would be good and I got a little nervous/curious about everything.

When I got back home I did some research and found out it was a progressive disease (which he didnt tell me it was).

So now I am really curious about everything (***And i know I should be questioning a real doctor, not the internet but until I get another appointment at the hospital, I would like to hear from people who may have LS like me***).

**So what i am curious about is:**

Is circumcision the better option? (especially at my age and time of diagnosis).

Can LS lead to something worse, if so what are the chances of it getting worse? (I feel like this is a stupid question)

And I would love to hear personal experiences (specially from people who got LS on their foreskin and got a circumcision after)

But mostly because I suffered with occasional migraine aura as a teenager.

They “ran out of room for her” in ICU and sent her home with 2hrs notice, and offered resources for “home check in services” who haven’t made a huge deal of what is shown in the photos.

I was abit shocked and scared but reassured by my nurse it usually clears itself but we will see in 1 years time. It's abit confusing how HPV is actually spread. Can anyone help me understand? I don't know if it's important to disclose to partners or not have sex until its gone, but was told I don't need to tell sexual partners but I can pass it on to a man 🙈 

My nurse said if a man has HPV and masturbates then he touches me sexually, I can then get HPV.

I picked her up from school today and when we got home she told me she hit her head on the elementary school's cinder block walls while rough housing in the hallway. She said it was pretty hard and even her classmates were surprised. Then she told me about five minutes after she hit her head, her nose started bleeding and kept bleeding for like ten minutes. She said she went through a lot of tissues. She didn't tell a teacher about hitting her head. I felt and looked where she says it hurts and it's not swollen or bruised.    

I freaked when she told me, but she isn't taking it super seriously and it's made me question if I've just been binging too much House. But at the same time, she's 11 so her word on most things means nothing, and ""nose bleed after hitting head"" never ever sounds good.

For the past 2 days i’ve also gotten hot randomly for a few minutes at a time but generally lower fevers.

• I am also fatigued throughout the day and feel more weak than usual.

• My upper eyelids have been somewhat swollen for the past three days.

• I can feel many of my lymph nodes in neck (not sure if swollen as i don’t know how they feel usually) but at least one about the size of a small grape? 

+ (Potentiallyrelated) 9 days before first fever started, I had similar ‘fevers’ for 3 days without other symptoms

222,AskDocs,I have been trying to do some research. Daughter has been off BCPs now for at least 7 years since 2016. Did well on them for a very long time—loestrin and then loloestrin. Gyno would always want and try to do a complete pelvic exam and all that involves every year but of course it was a no go with my daughter not sedated or anything. One of the reasons why I stopped giving her the BCPs plus she was no longer out and about in the public—around strangers. Her cycle remained stable and consistent off the pills—not heavy painful or anything abnormal. Fast forward to Nov. 2022–bivalent booster and then 2 weeks later Covid infection itself. The weird cycles started happening in December 2022. Daughters PCP did what she could—hormone blood work and then abdominal ultrasound. Both things came back normal and PCP did not want to take things further. I got daughter into her old gynecologist office at end of February. I was told many women affected by the Covid stuff but of course not certain for sure. She wanted to try 3 month trial of loloestrin which daughter is currently taking. First pack was a breakthrough period in middle of pack because I started them way late in her cycle. Finishing up 2nd pack and has been lite spotting now for 12 days which began in middle of pack. At visit her gyno of course brought up again the need for complete pelvic exam and Pap test—the works Even though my daughter is not and has never been “active”.   I don’t know how they think they are going to be able to do this without giving her something to be able to get this done. I understand some forms of sedation can be dangerous. I know I don’t want her to undergo general anesthesia—I think that is overkill. Can they give her something like what me and my husband get when we get colonoscopies by IV?  Or is there something that she can take by mouth? By mouth maybe would be the easiest way but I just don’t know if it would be enough.

As the title says - I experienced a blunt force trauma sports injury to the right side of my ribs, and from that evening on I began experiencing pain and discomfort on my right side. 

Four weeks later the pain became more severe so the doctor sent me for an X-ray and ultrasound: nothing but a ‘slightly fatter liver’ showed up on the latter, but the doctor said the pain was likely caused by unseen hairline rib fractures.

Here’s the thing - I regularly exercise (intensely 3-4 times a week), I have a balanced diet (though I could definitely do better, make improvements and eat less red meat) and I don’t eat a lot of cheese or have cream. Oh and I also drink on average 2-3 pints a month.

These aren't classic menstrual migraine because of their timing. In researching online, I've come across some literature that points to low iron status as a possible cause of this type of headache. I asked my PCP to check my ferritin (hemoglobin has always been normal). She agreed, but added that low iron probably isn't the cause of my headaches and had suggested oral contraception - which, of note, has made my headaches worse in the past. I also have a history of aura.

My lab results just came back - ferritin is 26 ng/mL. The reference range for the lab is 12-252 ng/mL. She wrote me a message and said my value is fine and suggested oral contraception. Much of what I'm seeing out there is that a value under 30 ng/mL in symptomatic patients requires iron supplementation with a ferritin target of 100 ng/mL. What are your thoughts?

Nothing too bad but something that was in the back of my mind when going.

We arrive in Ibiza and everything was ok until the last day. I got severely sunburnt and for some reason got myself into a right panic about it. Bear in mind I was fine before this. 

We board our plane home and I didn’t feel right at all. Spaced out, brain fog, sense of doom and a constant tight pressure in the front of my head.

I haven’t felt right since this occasion and over these 10 months I have been crying about 3-4 times a week for no real reason. I still have the constant head pressure, and feel like death is just around the corner even though I know it’s not. I went to the doctors for a blood test and everything was fine apart from my red blood cells were a little elevated but wasn’t a concern for the doctor.

Every day is a struggle now and I have completely changed as a person. I used to do happy and focus on the greatness of life. Now I feel like death is gonna haunt me every day and can’t seem to get rid of this forehead pressure. It’s draining me completely. 

Sorry for the rant but I feel a bit lost with it all.

Ovarian cyst lasting over a year and newly found retroverted uterus (previously normal)
relevant info: I have had a CT scan done last year (Jan 2022) when I had a kidney infection that showed a 2.5cm ovarian cyst and a normal uterus-i know that is normal and go away in a few months and not a cause for concern. I also recently (April 2023) had one done while in the ER presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and change in bowel habits (diarrhea) that all lasted about 3 weeks and started off mild and gradually got to be unbearable. The CT showed a 3.5cm cyst internally larger than previous exam. Blood work was completely normal besides elevated platelets (556 10*3/uL ref range is 150-375 10*3/uL )I was sent home with a diagnosis of a stomach bug. 

However, on the second CT it was noted that the cyst on my ovary was “intervally larger” and also showed a retroverted uterus-previously shown as normal. I will post the entire copied report as it leads to believe it is the same cyst and not a different one. There was no defining characteristics of the cyst labeled otherwise. 


My question is- I was previously told small cysts go away on their own- why would one last for more than a year? And can a uterus retrovert itself? Or is it all just difference in radiologist writings? 
I have already scheduled an appt with an OBGYN but can’t be seen for over a month.

i’m concerned about multiple things, but firstly, i do have fibromyalgia (both pain and ~3/4 of the other symptoms) so if that causes any of this it would be great to know that, I do get migraines, and i havé à fluctuating bp and bpm. i also have ADHD and take medication for that, as well as pregabalin, tizanidine (both for fibro), and generic allergy meds. there’s a history of eye problems and cancer (though not eye-related) in my family and i want to make sure i’m not like dying or something

i was trying to figure out if i had heterochromia when i noticed some weird things, firstly, some of my eyelashes are curling inward and/or growing down, and i also have eyelashes growing on my waterline and above my lash line, they are causing me to feel like i have something in my eye all the time and also causing random blurry spots

next there are some random white eyelashes and a BUNCH over my other lashes that are super thin and pretty transparent. also, apparently white roots aren’t normal and that happens too. ive also noticed that a lot of my eyelashes are blonder more towards the tip

next with my eyes, i havé a lot of light sensitivity and also these random grey rings in my iris? they’re super thin and there’s a bunch of them and it looks like i’m wearing contacts honestly(i have dark brown and amber eyes, one of them is bordering on hazel) (i don’t wear contacts i only wear glasses).

does anyone recognize this??

Gender: female

Relevant meds: occurs with different antibiotics 


I had what I now know is ALEP/AGEP from amoxicillin about 7 years ago, when I was in my early 20s after being able to take it without an issue my entire life. 

Since then I have seemingly developed sensitivity and get an ALEP rash after taking multiple different antibiotics including clindamycin, cefpodoxime, cefdinir (more mild than the other antibiotics) and most recently doxycycline. Some antibiotics I’ve developed this rash taking it for the first time (no prior exposure) and others I’ve taken before without an issue but then develop this rash, which is what happened with clindamycin, cefdinir,amoxicillin, and doxycycline. 

Every time I’ve gotten this rash it’s tiny pimple like pustules mostly on my face, neck, chest, shoulders and sometimes back. From my understanding it’s rare for this type of reaction to happen from just one medication, let alone several.

273,AskDocs,"Hi all!
Just wondering whether this summary of my 24 hour holter looks ok? 

30f, 5' 4"", 78kg. Ex smoker and casual drinker. No illegal drugs. Take 30mg lansoprazole daily and currently on a trial of amitriptyline at 10mg a day (1 week into the trial.. building up to 50mg as per consultants directions).

My ongoing symptoms are neuropathic pain (literally everywhere, like electric shocks), racing heart, livedo-type rash, petechiae on arms, white flashes in right eye and occasional blurred vision/large black spot in vision, also sensations that feels like spiders crawling on me daily, toenails lifting off, current psoriasis flare up, breathlessness, extreme fatigue. 

Diagnoses: hypermobility spectrum disorder, gastrosophageal reflux disease, psoriasis (guttate, plaque, inverse and nail psoriasis all at the same time right now. Have previously only ever had guttate, which I've had for 10 years). Rheumatologist also thinks I may have low-grade psoriatic arthritis. 

Recent blood tests include FBC/CBC, Magnesium, B12/Folate, ANA, ENA, dsDNA, anticoag, c3/c4, antiphospholipid, amongst some other autoimmune tests. All came back fine except MCV which always comes in at around 104.

I was sent for a 24 hour ECG for the racing heart and have received this back. 
Id be really grateful to hear of anyone's opinion on whether it looks all good, as my next appointment isn't for 4 weeks yet. 


Many thanks!

As part of a physical therapy programme to alleviate hip pain, five nights ago I was doing slow yoga. 

The next morning I woke to some intense lower back pain that hasn’t gone away since. 

The pain seems to occasionally wrap around to my right side and abdomen. Definitely worse in the morning after sleep, gets better throughout the day if I’m active and standing but will start being more painful if laying or twisting.

I’ve had lower back pain before, but never this type of pain so any advice or suggestions would be great.

277,AskDocs,"Hi there, I am a 25 year old female. 

I have quite a long medical history related to this issue but I’m going to be very brief for the sake of sparing your time. 

I was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension &gt;2 years ago. This has led to chronic pain and the reason I already have a neurologist and am on cymbalta and being treated for anxiety and depression. 

Fast forward to 6 months ago, I began having episodes which at the time were believed to be focal seizures. After an EEG, this was ruled out. I had a psychiatrist and neurologist evaluation and was told I was having non-epileptic seizures or functional seizures.

I have since started CBT with a Psychologist, my cymbalta has been increased to 120mg and I am actively practicing mindfulness as best as I can for short periods every day. I try to not let myself get depressed, though admittedly it does happen but I do have a great mental health team that supports me. 

The issue remains that I am still having these episodes. I wouldn’t be so worried but they are very debilitating; I cannot speak or move, my eyes don’t move and I get hyper emotional after. I have had issues where I have complete confusion, I don’t recognise where I am, or who is around me. It’s happening weekly, a few times a week sometimes. 

I have a great team but I was wondering if any of you have some experience in dealing with functional disorders and if so, if you have any more advice for me?

I am 23F. My maternal grandfather and uncle both had stomach cancer before they were 40. My uncle had a diffuse gastric cancer but I’m not sure about my grandfathers. A test for the CDH1 gene mutation came back negative. 

For the past 6 months I’ve had ongoing nausea. I’ve seen doctors for it and been prescribed zofran. I’ve now developed extremely frequent belching, an involuntary gagging thing, occasional regurgitation, a gurgling sound from my throat, mild pain in my upper left abdomen, and a complete loss of appetite / early satiety. I have lost about 15 pounds in around 4 months (145 -&gt; 132, height 5’5) but I am not sure when the weight loss started, it seems to be becoming more rapid. Fatigue is moderate but I assume it’s due to not eating enough, I often have pre-syncope. 

Now have 3 bumps that feel exactly like swollen lymph nodes limited to left epigastric region and more towards the left. Two of the bumps are larger and are tender and the third is not. I only noticed them yesterday. 

Both parents are doctors and confirmed feeling bumps but they’re psychiatrists so they’re not sure what it might be. 

I was hoping for some reassurance about what might cause these bumps, I have no signs of infection and the bumps are limited to that region.

289,AskDocs,"Id like to start off by saying i have a regular podiatrist I'm seeing, and has been helping me with the problem. I wont be using this thread to ""treat myself"" and only as a reference.

**Me:** 31, male, 5'9 220lbs no meds/medical issues

**My problem:** 

Extreme foot pain, burning and feels like I'm being jabbed with hundreds/thousands of hot burning needles. Feels like the entire bottom of my foot, but if i had to choose, the places where it hurts more/starts are the balls of my feet and the middle outer side. When it gets bad, I can barely stand, and it gets extremely painful, i shift my weight from one foot to the other to get some type of relief. If i sit down, the pain goes away in about 10 minutes or so, but if i start walking again the pain comes back very quickly. Other than having extremely wide, flatfeet. As flat possible, since childhood but no injuries and Both feet hurt exactly the same way. 

Ive been trying to figure it out for years... and from what I can tell, its when I put weight on them, specifically on the balls of my feet. The things that aggravate it the MOST are running, walking fast, and most most of all, calf raises/exercises, all where i put more weight on the balls of my feet. they start hurting and burning after just 1 set. the heavier i go, the faster they start, and more they hurt

**A little history:**

First time it came up was 9th grade (around 13/14 years old), pe class during track running. After running just a few minutes, they started burning hurting. My parents took me to doctors and spend hundreds on shoes but we couldn't figure it out or solve it.

I basically led a sedentary life cause of it. Weighed up to 330lbs at some point, walking and standing would hurt my feet tremendously, but i attributed that to my obvious weight problem. but the pain was exactly the same, as if they were (burning and being poked by needles).

Lost over 100 lbs., and am at 220 lbs now, and the pain is still present, hasnt gotten better at all. Wearing custom orthotics for a year, with little help if any. I really want to train legs, but i cant do any press/squat/calf because of the extreme foot pain. cant do treadmill, but elliptical actually doesn't hurt it at all, and stationary bike depends where I put my feet on the pedals.

My doctor's told me my feel seem fine, x-rays are normal, and they they are flexible, etc. They are ""normal"". So far, we tried a few things and we haven't been able to fix it. I don't know the exact terms, so ill try my best to describe it.

1)poor fitting shoes - this was 100% for sure correct. i have extremely wide feet.. and they seem to be getting wider. I buy 6e shoes and my feet still fall off the sides. I go through shoes very quickly because they start ripping at the sides.. but 6e was the widest i could find... he gave me orthotics for this, which helped, they feel great! I could finally step flat on the shoe! I thought this would fix it but it didn't.. they still burn.

2) Morton's neuroma, and that i should start taking gabapentin, but i explained to him that the problem started when i was in 9th grade, and probably earlier, its just that i only first started running in 9th grade and never noticed before. is it possible i had this when i was only 13/14 years old?

3) metatarsalgia, because of the weight loss, i loss the fat pad on the balls of my feet. The thing about this is, it hurt before i lost weight too... and my whole life. still, I've ordered the metatarsalgia pads and will be trying them soon

4)plantar fasciitis, but he pressed on my heel, arch, and even the balls of my feet and there was no immediate pain, not even soreness, but i haven't been on my feet at all that specific day, (early early morning appt). He doesn't think its this

5) erythromelalgia, but i dont think its this. i don't get random flareups. My feet do get very red, swollen, but its just when i put pressure on them.

**Conclusion:**

Does anyone have any opinion or idea what they think it could be? one of the mentioned above? or something else?

Hi everyone. For a few days I have been getting cramping feelings in my chest, throat and shoulders. It comes suddenly, usually in the evening while I’m not doing much and sat or laying down. It doesn’t last too long, a few minutes maximum. I have a strong history of acid reflux but have never experienced it like this before. My blood oxygen % is 99-100 during the episodes and my heart rate between 80-90bpm. I also feel my hard beating hard although I’m aware that may be anxiety.

303,AskDocs,"30 yr old male w/connective tissue disorder, dysautonomia, and mast cell disorder. I take zyrtec, cromolyn sodium, and use nicotine (oral pouches or gum). 

In May 2022 I had a bout of food poisoning, then chronic upper burning/gnawing pain below sternum. My doctor presumed gastritis. It never fully resolved on PPI. In August I had covid. The problem got significantly worse. I've learned to deal with the problem taking ppi or famotidine as needed.

For the past two months I've dealt with extreme nausea, vomiting bile nearly daily, and burning loose stools with rapid transit. Three days ago my upper abdominal pain became significantly worse while on a 20 minute walk. Every step felt like being stabbed in the stomach. I arrived back home and vomited a brownish liquid with a large amount of black blobs of congealed blood. 

I went to the ED because it was the first time I've ever vomited blood, and the pain was severe. They did labs and discovered nothing concerning. The abdominal x-ray done didn't reveal any clear perforations or anything significant. I was told to schedule an outpatient gastroenterologist visit for endoscopy (the soonest I can be seen is end of June). I can't see my PCP until the end of the month.

Since the ED visit I've been constipated. I finally had multiple bowel movements today that were darker than usual and smelled strongly of blood / iron, but weren't tarry black like absolute melena. My upper stomach still hurts quite badly, and am still perpetually nauseous despite being on prescribed pantoprazole. Based on my stool, I'm assuming there's still a slow active bleed, which is obviously concerning to me. 

Should I try to coordinate a sooner endoscopy? The ED doctors seemed annoyed that I even came in, so I'm not really sure what I should even be worried about in terms of symptoms or symptom progression. Because of my connective tissue disorder I'm also at higher risk for internal bleeding.

l am a 23M and I fractured my clavicle about a week and a half ago. I have gained a significant amount of mobility back since the break and can lift my arm up more then half way without any pain.

I have been to two orthopedic doctors and I had one tell me that it is recommended that I get surgery but is not needed and the other who told me I didn't need surgery. The ER i went to the day of the break also told me I didn't need surgery.

I do not want surgery and would like to take the non surgical approach. I would love to hear what others think as this situation is stressing me out a bit. I will provide a screenshot of my X-ray as well.

34F, 5'7"", 135lb. Currently on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and Ti-Sprintec. OTC generic brand Zyrtec for allergies. Non-smoker, currently on day 5 of symptoms, though some are thankfully gone now. 

In case it makes a difference, I was in Orlando last week for a conference. Did 2 days in Disney parks when the conference was not in session. Flew back to Texas Friday 4/14 and had no symptoms.

Saturday 4/15 I started running a 102 degree fever. Body aches, headache, night sweating while feeling like I was freezing, and a sore throat went along with the fever. Took 2 Naproxen around 2pm and the fever came down a little.

Sunday 4/16 the fever was down to high 99 degrees. Body aches and night sweats continued along with vivid fever dreams all night. Took 1 Naproxen before bed.

Monday 4/17 the fever was down to low 99 degrees. Body aches dull but still present and I still had night sweats and vivid fever dreams. I was able to get into a doctor to get tested for flu, COVID, and strep. These all came back negative. Doc thought maybe it was just a bad sinus infection even though I had no sinus issues. Tried taking a melatonin at bedtime to sleep better as I can normally take this without issue. Instead, I had the worst fever dreams of all.

Tuesday 4/18 I had no fever and body aches had disappeared. Still had night sweats and vivid fever dreams. The congestion started in my sinuses and all drainage and mucus is clear. Not even the lightest yellow tint. Did not take melatonin at bedtime but still had the fever dreams.

Wednesday 4/19 I am extremely fatigued but trying to do my thing at work. The worst symptoms are congestion and a periodic runny nose. Again, all drainage and mucus is clear, without any coloring.

Is this most likely just a really bad sinus infection that isn't discoloring the drainage? I was hoping one of the tests at the doctor would come back positive so that I would have something to blame the symptoms on. Maybe I'm just overthinking. I'm just miserable on day 5 of whatever this thing is and am ready to feel normal again. Especially ready for the fever dreams to go away.

About 1 month ago I experienced a very brief heart flutter(It felt as though my heart was shaking uncontrollably without rhythm for about 2-5 seconds. Since then, I've experienced brief periods of chest pain, usually lasting minutes. The best way I can describe it is a dull ache that sometimes builds in intensity. I've found myself increasingly short of breath after periods of walking or exercise I wouldn't have issues with prior, and my heart rate is typically elevated compared to where it was in the past, for example sitting doing work and my fitbit reading in the 90s-100s, where as it would typically range between 60-70.

I’m M19, and roughly 5 years ago i injured my lower back in a rugby game (guy picked me up and slammed me on the ground, i was kinda in a “U” shape so when i hit the ground it was lower back first) 

Since then, at the most random points there would be a day where movement of any kind hurts my lower back, Laying down, sitting, standing, walking, etc: just a constant pain as if someone just grabbed my lower spine and squeezed it, there have even been a few times where the pain was so bad i couldn’t move and had to lay in one place for a couple hours till it subsides/got easier to deal with.

I’m a healthy male (19, 5’8, 170ibs) who exercises quite often so as you can imagine the pain only comes and goes every once in a while, but the pain is extreme whenever it decides to start acting up.

320,AskDocs,"**I’ve been having post-nasal drip, phlegm, and throat irritation for about 9 months now, since a covid infection, with no improvement.** I’m working with my PCP on this (suspecting and treating for GERD right now), but would be really interested in other thoughts or avenues to pursue. I don’t want to get an endoscopy if it can be avoided, but that’s probably the next step if things persist.

**31F, Caucasian/Ashkenazi Jewish, 135lb, 5’5”.** I don’t drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. I’m sure my diet could be better, but it’s not bad and I don’t eat a lot of GERD-triggering foods.

**Medications:** Lithium (0.4 mEq/L), Bupropion (currently immediate release), Concerta (Methylphenidate)  
Then to address this, I take 40mg Prilosec, Zyrtec, and Pepcid Complete. I haven’t seen much of a change  
**Dx:** Bipolar II and ADHD. Physically I’m quite healthy. I do not have notable seasonal allergies

**Timeline:**

* July of 2022 - Covid infection, which was mild, and included a lot of phlegm/post-nasal drip (had none prior)
* Post-covid - Post-nasal drip and phlegm did not go away
* October - Took a course of doxycycline due to suspected sinus infection because of the drip – this did not help; symptoms persisted
* Nov - Made medication change to help with unrelated depression (bupropion immediate release → sustained release)
* Nov to Present - Nausea and other GERD symptoms (but no heartburn); still having drip

My doctor and I suspect GERD due to the drip/phlegm symptoms, persistent nausea, and some regurgitation into my throat. Except for my throat symptoms, which never changed, this worsened in Nov after the medication swap. I’ve been taking 40mg Prilosec a day for a little over two weeks now, and a few days ago I swapped my bupropion back to immediate release, to see if it would help with nausea. It did! But my throat symptoms remain. This looks like post-nasal drip, phlegm, and sore throats occurring almost every day. 

I’m supposed to update my doctor in about a week and am just so tired of feeling run-down from my throat and sinus issues, but don’t know what else I can change to address it.

Other possibly relevant notes:

* I've ruled out the Concerta is being an issue by pausing on it for a few weeks at a time, under the guidance of my psychiatrist. 
* I've attempted to increase my lithium dose a few times last winter, but every time I was met with intense and unrelenting nausea, and had to go back down. This is despite me previously being at that same higher dose with no issue at all in the past -- I've taken lithium for years with no other nausea. So seemed like it was exacerbating GERD and not the root problem?
* I've taken both Tums and pepto to address symptoms as needed and I don't think it has any effect at all. Similarly, nothing seemed to work on the nausea when I had that issue, not even zofran or compazine.

So my questions... 

Do the throat issues still sound like they're part of GERD, even though they started earlier and aren't improving? If so, can they take longer to go away than other GERD symptoms? Or have you seen this happen after a covid infection, even many months later? Is there anything I can or should be doing to help make things better?

Disclaimer: I have spoken to my doctor about this. However, I would like some more advice.

Hello! Looking for some opinions on what might be causing my palpitations, as I think it could be a couple of things.  For the past two weeks, I have been experiencing frequent palpitations. It started as a fluttering feeling that lasted 2-3 seconds when I went to sleep. However, this week they have gotten worse and more frequent. Several times a day (sometimes several “flutters” in a row) lasting 5-10 seconds.  I cannot identify a trigger/stressor for the palpitations; they seem to be random. I notice them less when moving around a lot (i.e. at work). I haven’t experienced palpitations this frequently or prolonged before. 

Additionally, my lips have been turning blue occasionally, especially when I’m cold (even though others in the room don’t feel particularly cold). My hands and feet are pretty much always cold as well. I know these could be symptoms of poor circulation, and the blue lips occur mostly when I’m sitting down/not as active. 

These are the things I think could be possible contributing factors:    


* I started Vyvanse (50mg daily) 5 weeks ago for ADHD. I didn’t have palpitations for the first three weeks on this medication. The medication works very well for my ADHD symptoms, so it would be disappointing if it is the cause. With the medication, I have to take my blood pressure regularly, which has remained within the normal range (&lt;120/80).
* If it isn't the medication on its own causing the palpitations, it could be the Vyvanse side effects, notably appetite decrease. This has caused me to eat less; however, I usually still eat when I am hungry in the evening when the effects wear off. I've been on a steady weight loss journey for the past year and a half anyway, so I have been living on a calorie deficit for a while. The Vyvanse has accelerated this though (I have lost around 8kg/18lbs since starting the medication five weeks ago).
* My sleep has also been poor this week, I've been getting less than 5 hours most nights just due to poor routine and stress.
* I usually get my blood checked every 6-12 months per my dietician's recommendation. I am prone to vitamin D and B12 deficiency, so I usually take a multivitamin daily. However, I haven't had a blood panel done for over a year.
* I have also been bruising very easily for the past three months.
* Other less significant medical conditions: 
   * I am diagnosed with PTSD and have ongoing therapy but no medication. 
   * I have a Nexaplon (progestogen-releasing) implant in my arm for birth control. 
   * I have some potential gynaecology issues, which I had an unaided visual cervix exam for. The doctor said it looked like I possibly had cervical ectropion and has referred me to a gyne specialist for a more thorough exam; however, this appointment isn't until late June. I could not get a pap smear due to my age (You have to be over 25 in the UK to get one).

I spoke to my doctor on Monday over the phone to speak about my palpitations and blue lips. As soon as I told them I started Vyvanse 5 weeks ago, they said that was probably the cause, and I should speak to my ADHD doctor and stop taking the medication, but they asked no other questions and didn't suggest any other causes or treatment.

I cannot get an appointment with my ADHD doctor until mid-May. It is my exam season starting next week, and I am hesitant to stop taking the Vyvanse as it has helped with my studies and my day-to-day productivity and energy levels.

I would like to ask my doctor to have my blood checked in case I am just low in iron or something and since I am overdue to have a blood panel done anyway. 

I thought it worthwhile asking here in the meantime to hear what the doctors on here think.

331,AskDocs,"So I'm hoping someone can help direct me on whether it's time to go see a physiotherapist at this point or not.

Male, 30s, average to athletic

I usually workout but took about 2 weeks off and definitely spend too much time sitting in front of screens. I worked out and felt a kink or pinched nerve of some kind and my back was horrible the next day and for months it was to the point where even sitting up in bed was painful. It got to a point where my front ribs on the right side became a bit numb feeling as well. 

I decided the only way to recover was to just get back to stretching, yoga and exercise in general and do about an hour each day. 

The sharp pain is mostly not an issue but my lower back right at the base and just above the hip bones is constantly feeling this sort of dull and tense kind of pain. It's somewhat better from the workouts but then it never really feels good like any other part of my body. I'm starting to lose hope that just stretching and exercise is really going to be able to heal my issue and is only just doing the bare minimal maintenance type of thing but am not sure what the issue is. Wouldn't strengthening the core and lower back and stretching those areas facilitate recovery in time? it's been about 5 months of this now.  


I was asking some people who said that maybe physio could do a deep tissue massage and break up the muscle so it can recover? I'm worried it may also be related to a surfing accident I had 10 years ago when a rock to the lower back broke my fall. Ever since whenever I get a bit worn out or low immune system wise my lower back flares up and I just feel like I have the back of a 60 year old now.

Maybe there is a disk issue? Does any of this sound familiar? Should I just book an appointment with the physiotherapist or go to the doctor for an x-ray? Have any of you had success with just doing more strengthening training or make sure you don't sit down as often?

332,AskDocs,"My Question: What, if anything, could this be and should I pursue figuring out a more concrete answer than I got 4 years ago? or would this be a waste of my and my Dr.’s time? 
(Please be nice, I’m super worried I’m making a big deal out of nothing)

Background:
I am 18F, I have been diagnosed with tension headaches as well as migraines with aura. I have also been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, ADHD and PTSD, for relevance to my medications.  

In terms of prescriptions, I take 50mg Imitrex, 600mg Trileptal, 10mg Prozac, 40mg Vyvanse,  10mg Dextroamphetamine, and 100mg Trazodone. I also take a combination of aspirin, sudafed, and acetaminophen for when my Imitrex runs out for the month. 

I first started getting headaches more than average when I was around 11-12. Sometime when I was 13, I started getting sporadic bouts of double vision during my headaches, and they would get so painful I’d cry and throw up. These headaches also included light and sound sensitivity. Then at 14, I woke up with double vision and it hasn’t gone away since, still with the very painful headaches. 

I have been to so many eye doctors who could not figure out why I was having double vision at such a young age. I was sent to a neurologist who did give me an MRI, even though it was not the normal type due to me having braces at the time. After I exhausted all the specialists in my area, they just settled on my eyes being “sensitive” with no solid explanation or test results and gave me prisms in my glasses to combat the double vision. 

This all came to a head when I was having what my family and I suspected to be a migraine, except this time when it reached it’s peak, I started to display stroke symptoms. I was speaking in gibberish, throwing up, couldn’t move around right, was numb in my right side, etc. 

My family took me to the ER because they thought I was having an actual stroke, but testing I got there showed it wasn’t a stroke. So they gave me a basic cocktail of migraine meds and sent me home with another neurologist referral. This neurologist just told us it sounded like migraines with aura and tension/stress headaches and gave me a prescription for Imitrex. I have never had another migraine of this type again.

Since then, I have not seen anymore doctors about these issues because of my family. I have been back to the eye dr. to change my prisms and prescriptions, but the last two times have done nothing for my eyesight. the prisms will kind of work until i get a migraine, and then pretty quickly my vision reverts back to double 24/7 with varying severity. 

Nowadays, I get migraines around 4 days out of the week, always with nausea, vomiting, light and noise sensitivity. I’ve developed severe jaw and ear pain that comes and goes pretty frequently throughout the week with no clear pattern relating to my migraines. I have very few days where I am not physically exhausted. I have spells of dizziness, air hunger, temperature intolerance, and brain fog that seem to coincide together independently as well.  
 
I’ve tried to look at possible explanations myself, but nothing seems to fit, which leads me to think I’m just paranoid. I am also very afraid of doctor’s appointments, so I probably will just keep putting it off unless things get really bad. I don’t want to embarrass myself and have my doctor think I’m a hypochondriac, but these symptoms are affecting my daily functioning pretty bad. 

Please let me know what you think it may be and if I should bother an in-person doctor about it!

**SYMPTOM HISTORY**

Jan 2021 - one night while using a THC oil vape cartridge I ended up getting a burning sensation in my stomach and just felt weird. Once I stood up I had a metallic taste in my mouth, my heart was pounding, I was shivering, sweating, and my pupils were dilated. For weeks afterward, I felt weak and my heart would beat rapidly if I did anything extraneous. This isn't when my abdominal pain started occurring but I still think it might have something to do with the problems I'm facing now.

2021 - After what seemed to be a panic attack? I started to feel less weak but I developed shortness of breath where I could not take a satisfying deep breath. This lasted for months. I had 2 pulmonary function tests done and my breathing capability was normal.

Jun 2021 - I would still get a rapid heartbeat occasionally when going upstairs or running, etc. Also while still dealing with the problem of not being able to take a satisfying deep breath I started getting a dull pain under my sternum that would come and go and would feel better if I crossed my arms against my chest and applied a bit of pressure. This is what I would do to fall asleep when it was bothering me.

End 2021 - Started taking omeprazole daily but it didn't seem to help at all. I started getting touch tenderness around my belly button. The stomach pain/discomfort has gotten worse. When moving around my stomach pain seems to get worse. Laying down made it more manageable. 

Mar 2022 - Went to the ER one day when it was incredibly uncomfortable and the pain kept me in bed. The doctors at the hospital told me there was nothing they can do since it wasn't deemed an emergency and sent me home with 

Jun 2022 - Had my first endoscopy which I was told showed chronic gastritis but no inflammation. Started taking 60mg omeprazole, 40mg famotidine, and sucralfate. I didn't get any relief but the doctors told me to do it for a few months. (It still didn't give any relief). I was also eating a bland diet. (Rice, Boiled Chicken, Plain Oatmeal) I maintained this diet for a few months but I didn't notice any improvement at all.

Aug 2022 - Had an ultrasound done that didn't find anything significant.

Jan 2023 - Started seeing a new doctor who wanted me to try omeprazole again... also had me use a laxative daily for 2 months. And put me on amitryptiline 25mg a day to try. (nothing helped). 

Feb 2023 - CT scan. Didn't show anything. Was put on metoclopramide 4 times a day.

Mar 2023 - Trying Buspar instead of amitryptaline. Had a endoscopy with this new doctor and no gastritis was found. But I was told I had a lot of gastric fluid in my stomach. Gastric emptying test done with normal results.

Apr 2023 - HIDA scan that showed low ejection fraction (26%). Currently waiting to have a consultation with a surgeon about getting it removed.

**TESTS**

Endoscopy #1 - Chronic Gastritis no inflammation

Ultrasound - Normal

CT Scan - Normal

Endoscopy #2 - Normal except for level of gastric fluid in my stomach.

Gastric Emptying Test - Normal

HIDA Scan - 26% Ejection Fraction

**MEDICATIONS/SUPPLEMENTS TRIED**

Omeprazole, Famotidine, Bentyl, Metoclopramide, Sucralfate, Amitriptyline, Buspar, Various Probiotics, DGL, Phazyme, Triphala, L-Glutamine, FDgard, GI-Encap, Ashwagandha, Mastic Gum, Slippery Elm, Various Laxatives, Psyllium Fiber, Beef Organs, Collagen, and probably more I cant think of. Most of the supplements were taken while thinking my main issue was gastritis.

Ah this will potentially sound a bit dumb, I'm not very educated about these things! But it's been bothering me. 

You know when you clench your abdomen muscle, and it ""sucks in"" your gut? Are you ""sucking in"" your actual organs or your belly fat? Or both? 

I've been getting more targeted weight loss adds/media and such (I was looking up veggie based recipes, rip me lol) that's been making me question both the logic of the adds/media and also own? For example, I thought muscles sat underneath body fat, so that if you clenched your abdomen, it would suck in your organs but not the fat? Maybe I'm wrong. 😅

Honestly I'm not even sure how I expected having abbs to work. I guess I never thought about it, but do people with visible abbs just not have belly fat? Can you have belly fat on top of strong abbs?

I went to my GP and she had no idea what it could be, and prescribed me antihistamines just in case it was an allergic reaction to something. 

I was just wondering if anyone has seen something similar and knows what it could be? I've Googled all kinds and nothing seems to fit!

Thanks so much in advance.

343,AskDocs,"For the past 12 years I’ve had a sensation in my lower chest/upper stomach area. It occurs almost daily, sometimes multiple times a day and lasts for one to two seconds. I have no dizziness and when I immediately check my heartbeat after, it feels normal.

I have had the following tests done, all of which came back normal: a stress test, an echocardiogram, a chest x-ray, multiple ekgs, multiple blood panels, and multiple holter monitors. I have been to the emergency room multiple times and have seen several cardiologists.

I am a 33 year old female. Normal BMI. Cholesterol good. Blood sugar good. Blood pressure good. I eat healthy, drink a lot of water, don’t do drugs or smoke, rarely drink, and exercise daily. I do have acid reflux and panic disorder. My family does not have any medical conditions that I’m aware of. With that said, my dad did pass away at 59 due to a heart attack (he lead a very unhealthy lifestyle).

The general consensus among my doctors was that I’m anxious and that it’s nothing heart related. I’ve accepted that this is likely benign but am wondering if someone can explain to me the exact mechanism of what is likely going on. Is my stomach spasming? Did I just feel my heart beat extra hard? It’s unnerving sitting at a desk and suddenly feeling the sensation.

So a little over a week ago (I think April 9th, 2023), my cat was walking on my lap and punctured my penis head with her claw. I'm not sure if it was directly on the head (like she went under the foreskin somehow) or from over top of the foreskin. Hopefully it was over top of my foreskin, so bacteria didn't get in there. But my foreskin looks fine itself. Now there is a bump on my penis head near my frenulum, under my foreskin, for over a week now, and it hurts to touch. The thing is I can't access the actual cut because I have tight foreskin, but I can feel and see the bump under there. I am worried about it. it doesn't seem infected, but I don't know how long it will take to heal and have regular function again.

I am a little worried that I gave myself a repeated strain injury. Could I have somehow moved one of my wrist bones out of place or something??

It's not painful at all, even to the touch, and it doesn't restrict my moment, thought my right hand feels a little stiffer than my left. (Could be imagining it.)

355,AskDocs,"My mum has a catheter following a stroke 6 months ago. Without the catheter she has urine retention so she'll most likely need it for the rest of her life. 

The catheter causes her pain that is affecting her quality of life as she can't sit in her wheelchair when it's hurting so she's stuck in bed. She is in a nursing home and we have not been able to get anyone really to take this pain seriously.

I asked her GP about the possibility of a suprapubic catheter instead but he dismissed that without a discussion. 

We are considering moving my mum to a new home for various reasons. During a pre-assessment, the staff at the new home learnt that the catheter is being flushed daily and they were very surprised. The current home says if they don't flush daily then it gets blocked.

Potential new home told us this is very unusual and they are surprised no investigation has been done into the pain or the cause of the blockages. The potential new home says it's a bad idea to flush daily due to the infection risk. They think potentially a suprapubic catheter could be better.

I feel like I constantly get told different and conflicting information by nurses and carers at the current home on all sorts of topics, so it's hard to know what is true.

Here are my questions:

- Is it likely that it's true the catheter gets blocked if not flushed daily? Is that common?
- If it is getting flushed daily, should they be investigating the underlying cause or is it just one of those things you have to deal with? 
- Is it normal for a catheter to cause pain? Is there anything that can be done? 
- Would a suprapubic catheter potentially be a solution? (I understand it would require a hospital trip to be installed and another for the first change)

Thank you for any insight.

Hello! My dr suspects I have some form of IBD after many years of symptoms. I just had my first colonoscopy on Monday, my results paperwork said “overall your colon looked healthy. Several biopsies were taken and results will be available in 2 weeks with your family dr.” Out of curiosity I looked at my blood work online from March 11 and I see that my CRP is quite high (82.15 to be exact) which I see can be common with IBD. I also understand that while IBD wasn’t visually seen during colonoscopy it can be diagnosed via biopsy so I am anxious for the results of those biopsies. My dr did not mention my high CRP levels to me, I’m wondering if I should be concerned about this number? 
Also will a dr always state whether or not they found polyps/ulcers/inflammation/etc on colonoscopy paperwork?

368,AskDocs,"My little boy is very almost 2 (birthday next month) and he’s has enlarged lymph nodes for 9 months. To find his lymph nodes a few months ago you had to feel round abit to find them but in the last 2 months they have been slowly growing and you can see them on his neck from across the room! He has other symptoms also which are; 

- Pale 
	- Lack of interest in playing 
	- Increased thirst - drinking 3-4 times the amount he has been since the weekend. He needs his nappy changed hourly as if not it leaks as it physically cannot hold anymore urine after one hour. Also having to change his sheets and PJs 2-3 times a night as he’s soaking through his night time nappies. These are nappies designed for the night that should be able to hold 12 hours worth of urine but he’s lay in a puddle of his own urine after only 3-4 hours
	- Refusal to walk - he no longer wants to walk anywhere, just wants to be carried or pushed in the pram where as previously he’d demand to walk everywhere. He has been able to walk confidently for 11 months and completely ditched crawling but this last week has regressed to crawling instead of walking more and more 
	- Tiredness - his ability to stay awake has shortened and his nap length has increased 
	- Rash - a red pin prick rash that appears on his stomach and chest with no other symptoms that fades after a few days. It appears at random with no known cause I can work out and doesn’t respond to priton 
- Hot to touch - recently he’s felt very warm to touch but his temperature is normal 
	- Always ill - this might not be anything and might just be his age but he doesn’t attend nursery or a child minders as I’m a stay at home mum so I wouldn’t of expected him to constantly be poorly.

I’m in the UK so have taken him to the GP numerous times but each time they’ve said they aren’t concerned!! The last time we went I came prepared with NHS guild lines for referral and our local children’s hospital referral process for enlarged lymph nodes, he ticks all the boxes for referral and has a couple “red flags” but they still refused to refer him to a paediatrician. The only test they’ve performed is a urine test which came back negative and they’re seeing this as case closed.

Previously got diagnosed with gastritis in January (with no cause but think it was caused by a couple of months of chronic stress) before this had never had stomach issues of any kind. 

My gastritis seemed to have healed as I am able to eat things without pain and am off ppis (I still don’t eat tomatoes, any caffiene, no sodas and coffee or spicy foods. Mostly out of fear but also because my current symptoms I don’t want to make worse) 

My current symptoms are a squeezing in my stomach and what feels like a rush of adrenaline and excessive burping. At first I thought it was anxiety as my doctor told me. I’ve changed my routine, I meditate, I try to jog when my symptoms aren’t acting up. I don’t have a very stressful life but these symptoms make my very uneventful life stressful. I feel anxiety could be part of this but not all of this. 

The squeezing and adrenaline rushes happen randomly but all day long. I get maybe 1-2 hrs of not feeling this but again it’s random. It almost feels like a constant stressful feeling in my body and it messes with my head. It also makes me feel weak and a little breathless. I don’t know if I’m getting heart palpitations as well or if it’s just making me much more aware of my heart.. I get pressure in my chest as well. I do breathing techniques which has always relieved my anxiety but breathing techniques/relaxing isn’t giving me any relief. What could this be? 



I’d like to follow up as well that for the anxiety I have a therapist appt tomorrow and I also am seeing a new doctor a month from now to get a second opinion because I don’t feel my doctor rn is taking my symptoms seriously and how much it’s affecting my everyday life. 

I’ve gotten thyroid tested it came back hypo but a few weeks later leveled out back to normal. 

I’ve had stress test done a few months back when I didn’t know I had gastritis I thought something was wrong with my heart.

Just want to let you guys know that my 5th EMG yesterday came back completely clean and normal :). My 3rd and 4th in July and October were nasty. Happy to send the EMG reports to anyone curious.

But I hope they begin to improve like all the other symptoms. Brain fog is completely gone too! And I’m beginning my MBA at Cornell this fall!

Body covered in potential poison ivy but it’s now all over my body (face so far is just on forehead) stomach and legs are covered and continue to spread hourly. Feet also yellowing over last few days (f29US). Thought possible exposure to poison ivy 5 days ago. Went with weeping wound that was only slightly purple at time and rash all over. They just told me again it was poison ivy (head Dr in ER nurses were wigged out, and doctor that I’m pregnant and other people only take the pills for asthma and poison doesn’t fall under that which made me feel bad for asking because the midwife had mentioned pills if it worsened when I called before heading over). I’ve never reacted to poison ivy like this in my life only a few spots. I’m 11 weeks and very concerned about infection for baby. She also told me my ankle wasn’t infected at all and to just eyeball it when it was oozing and red/puffy to return (but I came in with it like that so I am so confused). She seemed irritated. I’ve used calamine, benedryl cream, and now her steroid today which honestly none of it touched - I’ve been awake for nights insanely itchy! I pointed out my foot she said nothing and I noticed in my notes it said my blood pressure was 139/110 and had a warning sign to follow up which wasn’t discussed at all. The rash spread more today which is day 6 since potential exposure. Any ideas? I’m getting so scared only my ankle has the slight purple yesterday and it’s everywhere today. The steroid cream she gave me really doesn’t seem to even stop the itch. I did call midwives again to share the purple is spreading rapidly and foot yellowing further they didn’t want to see the pics but said it’s too early for cholostasis of pregnancy or whatever that rash is called.

I can feel it across my forehead, on top of my skull and the left side of skull. Initially only started on forehead but has spread since and now I can feel it behind my left eye and left ear. 

The symptoms: 
 • Warm/burning sensation with tingling/pins and needles
 • Dizziness/fuzzy feeling in head
 • High pitched frequency in ear and back of skull
 • Throbbing pressure/tightness inside head, almost like a heartbeat
 • Stiffness in neck and base of skull
 • Tunnel vision

There is no actual pain though. The burning makes me feel nauseous. The affected side feels quiet in my head or like its been muted somehow. It has destroyed my appetite and any attempts to eat seem to intensify the symptoms. It prevents me from sleeping and wakes me up throughout the night. It all seems to have come out of nowhere. One minute I was fine and the next it felt as though my head was on fire.

I have been to hospital multiple times and blood tests and CT results came back clear. Doctors have told me that it is simply a viral infection or even anxiety and told me not to worry but it seems to be getting worse rather than better. No type of pain relief is taking the burning/tingling sensation away.

Existing medical issues: ibs, hyperactive pelvic floor, ocd, panic disorder

I've been experiencing light headedness/dizziness (almost like I'm on a boat) for the past 6 months or so. It's accompanied by brain fog and I have a hard time focusing on anything. It lasts for a few hours and usually happens once or twice a week. It will usually start happening and won't go away until I've had a full night of rest and reset. 

I thought this was probably from my anxiety issues and assumed I was overstimulated/overwhelmed and my anxiety was morphing into light headedness. However, a friend told me to get my vitamin levels checked since apparently, this can be a symptom of certain deficiencies. I thought I would do an at-home test just in case although I was expecting healthy results. 

The at-home test said I had [12.3 ng/mL of vitamin D](https://imgur.com/a/rjI8rk0). I researched what I'm supposed to do about this and decided it was over my head and I made an appointment with my primary care physician. I showed him my test results and explained why I originally got the test. He told me vitamin D levels were not important and that 12.3 ng/mL is not that bad for living in Boston. I tried to push on it a little to get further reassurance but he kind of brushed me off and acted like I was asking about a field of hokey science. 

I'm not a doctor and maybe vitamin supplements are a hokey science - but I can't tell if my primary care physician is right that vitamin D levels don't really matter or if the internet is making 12.3 ng/mL seem lower than it actually is. 

I'm looking for some different perspectives on this because I'm hesitant to self-prescribe vitamin D (even though it's over the counter) since I wouldn't know how much to take and I would be kind of ignoring my doctor. But I also have this lingering feeling that the doctor was not listening to me and I need some reassurance that 12.3 really is not something to worry about.

I hadn't been touching it or anything the past couple days but it hurt a lot when I woke up so I took a pocket knife and made a small incision in the cuticle of the finger nail and a lot of puss came out. The bump did go down a decent amount but it's still quite inflamed. I figured its probably not a good idea to just go and keep making incisions until the lump is gone, but I am not sure if I can leave it alone. Also, prying my fingernail up and then purposefully poking through the skin was extremely painful and I don't want to do that again.

So I have been dealing with this inflammation for almost 3 years &amp; it's really bothering me. I am insecure over how puffy they look constantly (no matter what I try). Does anyone know what this is or what could treat it??

-thought it was an allergic reaction to my gel nails, no.
-I removed all product from my fingernails for 6 weeks with no change. No improvement, still red.

I also tried: betamethasone cream, hydrocortisone (which made it worse), bacitracin, &amp; hyaluronic acid... Nothing I do touches this puffy redness under all my cuticles &amp; I'm super sad.

Please help if there's any suggestions?

About two months ago I discovered a lymph node I thought was quite large. It really freaked me out and I seeked out a doctor ASAP. He felt it and said it was large but probably not serious. I saw a second doctor who said the same thing, mostly because of the fact that it had clearly defined border and could move around. Suggested I get an ultrasound for piece of mind. Ultrasound found 2 nodes, one measuring 2.7x1.4x.6cm, the other 1.6x.9x.4cm, with ""fatty centers suggestive of benign disease and  no vascular abnormality."" The radiologist suggested an ENT visit. ENT said it felt fine but was quite large, so he ordered a biopsy. While waiting for the biopsy, I ordered a CBC because I was feeling EXTREME stress. Kept touching my lymph nodes. CBC came back as follows: Absolute neutrophils: 4386, Absolute lymphocytes: 3130, Eosinophils: 456, Basophils 17. I noticed my lymphocytes on the higher end of the range. 

During all of this, I have been feeling extreme anxiety around my nodes that has triggered some pretty serious GERD. ENT said the bad of my tongue was burnt because of it. I also experienced some pretty extreme bloating and burping during anxiety relapses. 

Basically, is this stress warranted? I just wanted to throw my profile out there and get some opinions that might help me reduce my stress.

So I went on a trip to the DR last June and when I came back I had massive diarrhea which I hear can happen. It took almost a month for me to get back to normal but I did notice my stools never seemed to form back to regular. They seemed to always be changing in how they looked and they seemed to be soft or just break apart due to being so soft. 

Fast forward to last month I started looking up symptoms of colon cancer and it made me hyper focus on my stool and my body to where it has been giving me insane anxiety and stress which in return does not help my gut.

The symptoms I've been having is obviously the stool always being different (you can check post for photos)
Abdominal pain around my right ribs that radiates to the left, to the sternum, to lower middle. Usually dull or sharp and last a few seconds but can happen all day esp if I think about it..if I don't it actually tends to go away.

But for the past few days I've been very nauseous after I eat..it seems the food just sits and I can't throw up..if I do its just acidic and when I finally am able, it's just all the food I had the day before. This has also given me pains in my gut, mainly middle sternem area but still the random pains on my right and left side. I also pretty much shit exactly what I ate. 

Is this something that sounds like complications from colon cancer or something gi related that is less serious? I'm not sure if the nausea is from being sick on Thursday or not.

I also want to point out after I eat or if I don't eat I can hear and feel my stomach gurgling from the right side of my body kinda under the ribs.",t2_cbl4scec,0,Does this sound like colon cancer symptoms,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12s6uyf,True,Mrcsbud2,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12s6uyf/does_this_sound_like_colon_cancer_symptoms/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12s6uyf/does_this_sound_like_colon_cancer_symptoms/,475937,1681931578,0,,False,1681931591,1681931592,2023-04-19 19:12:58,,,

Don't drink nor smoke. No drugs.

I have had back pain since my university years. That pain improves with exercise and stretching and it has always been that way. My first hernia (left L2L3) appeared at 27 years old one day when waking up from bed. The second hernia (left L3L4) bursted with a lot of pain a couple of months ago simply by bending slightly carrying no weight to open a drawer.

I was fed up with my back pain and made a NMR by myself. My GP only prescribed me ibuprofen which I'm still having. It seems I have shiny corner signs in one of the vertebrae and the radiologist says it is indicative of spondylitis.

Have had constant colds in winters, intestinal issues and hypothyroidism since at university.

We have discovered recently that both my mother and me have been having acephalgic migraines (my mother since her 20s, and me since ever). That may explain difficulties understanding language that we both have been having some times. I also complain of memory and focus since I was a teenager. It seems arthritis may be related to migraines 

I have had pains in feet, shoulders, knees for the last 20 years. I walk bended for the first hours of the day till I stretch since some years ago... etc... etc...

So there is a big chance, I may have spondylitis.

I'm still weeks ago from the rheumatologist appointment and I haven't had any indication of what to do with the ibuprofen I was having for the second hernia. I was trying to reduce it since I have been having it since three months ago and the pain for the hernia and the weakness is much better but my left hip is burning (which didn't happen before, this is the first time I have this kind of pain in my hip), and I'm afraid trying to reduce NSAIDs may be a very bad idea.

Supposing I have spondylitis, what should I do with the dose of the Ibuprofen to reduce risks associated with spondylitis? What would it be a proper dose?

My upper back hurts in a very specific spot on my right side since September. The spot is between the spine and scapula, I would say thoracic not cervical area, closer to the spine. The pain was sharp mostly from the afternoon on (not during any type of activity) and started on a day I was doing an activity outdoors (a photo shoot with some moving around, nothing extreme though).

I didn't pay any mind as it seemed at times that it got slightly better and never worse.

I went a month ago to an orthopedic who said he thinks its neck related and asked for an MRI in the region. I did the MRI and should some issues in the A4-A5, A5-16 and A6-A7, vert. however on the left side. The doc asked me if I have any pain on the left side but I have none. Still he said he is certain the neck is the cause regardless of pain side.

I have my doubts though. Should I trust him or get another opinion?

I felt like his diagnosis is rushed, without actually listening to me.

418,AskDocs,"Hello! I sprained my ankle about 6 months ago and I am still dealing with lack of mobility. Details and timeline below:

Oct. 28: I tripped and sprained my ankle while hiking. Like completely ate it. I had to very slowly walk over a mile back to my car alone (lesson learned, don’t play with nature alone). Immediately went to urgent care to get an X-ray because my insurance was ending in a few days (switching jobs with a few weeks in between). X-ray came back clear. They told me to RICE and gave me crutches. 

After about 3-4 days I still wasn’t able to get my foot flat enough to bear weight. I reached out to a former chiropractor of mine who deals with a lot of foot/hand injuries. He told me to do ABCs, heel/toe raises, massage gun around the ankle, Achilles, and lower belly of calf, then said to muscle scrape these same areas and then do an ice dunk for 5 minutes. After doing this once I was able to walk. I did this a few times a day for a few months. It definitely helped but I was not back to normal.

End of December: My PC ordered an MRI. The MRI showed a high grade tear of ATFL and CFL, and also fraying of the peroneal brevis tendon. MRI was done on Jan. 3. About 10 weeks after the injury.

Jan. 16: Went to an Ortho surgeon. Ortho did another X-ray (clear) and sent me to PT 2x a week for 4 weeks. I did the exercises the chiro told me daily until I started PT.

Jan. 24: Started PT. It helped a lot with my pain, stiffness, and stability, but I still could not for the life of me get my knee past my toes when weighted (like when squatting or going down stairs). The PTs just kept trying to jam it forward and have me do the same stretches for weeks for it even though it was NOT helping. When trying to get my knee past my toes, I don’t feel a stretch, pain, or anything like that. It’s like it’s just stuck. I have continued to do my PT exercises 4-5x a week at home. 

Feb. 13: Follow up with Ortho. I told him the above info. He ordered me a Dynasplint for dorsiflexion.

Feb. 28: I got the Dynasplint. I was instructed to wear it 6-8 hours a day. I had the most progress within the first few weeks (mostly noticed going down stairs was slightly better). But still little to no progress with knees over toes/stairs are still weird. 

March 29: Follow up with Ortho. He said keep wearing it and to come back in a month. 

Today: I have almost maxed the Dynasplint out. (I started at a 7.5, which is a high starting point but I had also done a lot of work with my ankle prior to getting it). I bumped up to an 11 early last week. (I have been going up in half increments every 7-10 days ish. But never going up until I have wiggle room at the current setting.) My plantar and dorsiflexion are only a hair behind my good ankle now, but still no progress with knees over toes and since bumping to 11 I am starting to get some pain, stiffness, and slight swelling again. 

I text the Dynasplint rep every time I go up. I texted him this morning to tell him that I have been able to increase the splint, but now I’m starting to have some regression and still no progress with knees over toes.

He said it sounds like my ROM is better but I’m still struggling with mobility. He said he was going to ask someone else and would call me later today. 

I have a follow up with the Ortho next week, but it seems like I’ve bamboozled everyone.

Any ideas what this is/how it can be improved? I live a very active lifestyle and I’ve been able to adapt, but this is definitely not normal and after 6 months of this I am getting incredibly frustrated.

It's never self directed anger though, I love myself.

It ended in a 6 day long bender and I crashed a car. I just don't want this bad stuff to happen again, I burned a lot of bridges last time it happened.

My mom and I do not want to take me to the hospital despite it being suggested by my doctor before if things got ""worse"" (I put in quotes because I do not feel bad at all, I feel great and I have been doing amazing lately, it's my best term in school by far) because my uncle was mistreated there and he killed himself in 2019 because people werent right to him and didn't understand him. Also because I don't have the time, next week I have a big school event thing for 2 weeks all day and it's important to go to. And I still have 2 finals left on friday. I also am making oven bake clay sculptures for my professors and I want to show my appreciation so I need the time to do that.

HELP! What are you thoughts with the diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?

28F, 5'2', 155 lbs, Canada, no medical issues or current medications, do not smoke. drink a little

I stubbed my toes really badly 10.5 weeks ago. I had bruising and swelling, which the bruising went away. I now still have swelling, and my foot turns purplish when I do no elevate it.

I have gotten 2 xrays and an ultrasound which show nothing. My GP mentioned it could be soft tissue damage or a stress/hairline fracture. But after many weeks of no improvement he sent me to a specialist.

The specialist gave me Naproxen to take for 3 weeks, which did nothing for me at all.

I went back to my specialist for my 4 week follow up appointment and now he is saying he thinks I probably have CRPS because its been too long now and if its still swelling and turning a different color then its most likely CRPS. He also said a lot of doctors do not think CRPS is a real thing...

He has told me to take gabapentin for 3 weeks (300 MG pills x 3 times daily) and has told me to try to stop using an air boot and to try to walk with a good shoe to get some range of motion in.

I looked in CRSP and now I am terrified reading that it can turn into a disability...

Hello docs,

I had a MRI Arthogram done on my shoulder, because I'm having severe front shoulder pain right where my pec meets the humerus under the collarbone, its been there for 2 years now, my doctor says it will take 2 weeks before I get my report, so I thought maybe one of you docs could take a look and see if there is something out of the ordinary. Would appreciate it a lot. I did physiotherapy for like 1 year now and nothing is helping.. 

A couple of the MRI pictures here in the imgur link.

 Thanks in advance!

425,AskDocs,"I (41M) have an issue which has really been a issue for me all of my life, but it is having an increasingly large impact on my career so I feel like I need to try and find a solution, if in deed there is one to be found. I know that reddit isn't an idea first place to try, but to be honest I'm not sure where to start, and, as you will see, the problem itself makes it difficult to talk to a professional in person about it.

The issue is as follows. In many situations which are only very mildly (if at all) stressful I get a strong adrenaline reaction. Sweating, very shakey hands, slight quaver to my voice, my heart beats fast. e.g. a one to one meeting over coffee with someone. On a conference call with members of my team ( many more junior than me) a point may come where I want to ask a question or make an interjection, and in the seconds leading up to it my throat tightens up, and I end up staying silent.

At more stressful times, which many people would have the reaction I describe above, it is completely  debilitating. My jaw tenses up so much that it is extremely difficuly to control my voice - it needs all my effort, so I have no resources to put into thinking of what I'm saying. A job interview is impossible for me, and a presentation is only possible if I read robotically from a prepared script.

It may be a mental thing, and for many years I thought it could be, but I'm starting to feel that it's not normal. I am a sociable person and like meeting new people, why do I have this reaction? I have no fear of interviews themselves, I know that I know my stuff, but I can't succeed at them because of this reaction.

I work in an investment bank and I am good at my job in many ways, otherwise I could not have been promoted to my current level despite these severe deficiencies. But now the ""Peter Principle"" is kicking in, and I am more and more often finding myself in situations where it is a problem. 

Has anyone heard of such an issue, and are there any ways to alleviate the issue? Do I need to ask to a phychologist instead? Are there medicines that can help?

Last night while resting on the sofa, I suddenly started having what felt like intermittent spasms in one spot in the upper middle, right side of my chest. They weren't painful, just annoying and concerning. Like a soft squeeze that would last about half a second. They lasted overnight and lessened in intensity until gone. I could feel them with my hand and had my partner rest their hand on my chest to confirm I wasn't just anxious and imagining things. 

I haven't had any injuries or overexertion with that area, which has me worried it could be something heart-related although heart stuff tends to be left-sided. 

I'll be in touch with my doctor soon, but was wondering if anyone here could tell me what this sounds like because I'm guessing it could just be a random muscle spasm since I was able to feel it with my hand. I could be wrong, but I don't imagine you'd feel an artery spasm with your hand.

Don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, not taking any medications, no serious medical issues, blood sugar normal. Recently went to cardiologist, did ECG/ultrasound - normal.

I've had an acute (probably adenoviral) conjunctivitis bit more than 3 weeks ago. Had extremely red left eye and watery discharge for approx. 10 days, then it subsided. Didn't treat with anything except for washing with sterile water.

On day 3 of conjunctivitis started having fever, fatigue, and some respiratory symptoms (cough/nasal discharge) that lasted for 4 days. Afterwards have been fine for 2 weeks. 

Yesterday started seeing halos at night, and noticed very slightly decreased visual acuity, both affecting left eye. Went to doctor, have been diagnosed with subepithelial infiltrates in one eye after acute (probably adenoviral) conjunctivitis (acute phase was 2-3 weeks ago).  No other symptoms. Prescribed with hydrocortisone.

Been reading more about it on the internet, but still have some questions:

\- if left untreated, what is the likelihood of them disappearing on their own?

\- if untreated, are they likely to increase in number/size?

\- what is the likelihood of remissions after steroid course?

\- what steroid course durations should i be concerned about with regards to possible side effects?

This probably sounds like a really stupid question, but I'm actually serious. I had a VERY deep, VERY infected ingrown toenail yesterday. The numbing injection wasn't working very well, and the doctor ended up having to put it right up against the swollen area. One of the most painful things I've ever experienced. After the surgery the surgeon made it very clear to me it WOULD hurt like hell for a few days and would bleed through the bandage by the morning. Not should, not likely would, ABSOLUTELY would. As expected, Last night was absolutely miserable. Once the lidocaine wore off, nothing seemed to eased the pain. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, ice pack, elevating my foot, nothing seemed to change. It started easing about 3 in the morning, enough for me to sleep. 

But here's the weird part. When I woke up around 8:30, I had nearly forgotten about the toenail because there was no pain whatsoever. I'm not exaggerating either, it only feels any discomfort if I press on the bandage, but it's less uncomfortable than having a pebble in my shoe. I'm not a tough person, I am a wimp and very sensitive to pain. Just poking me a handful of times makes me hurt. It also didn't bleed through the bandage, and the only blood I see is on the very bottom layer of the cotton/gausse or whatever it's called.

It seems like this should be a very good, very lucky thing. But the fact that the surgeon was so adamant, in no uncertain terms, and without any possibility of a better recovery, makes me a little worried that something went wrong and something with my nerves stopped working, like how diabetics sometimes have trouble feeling their feet. I can still feel my toe, and putting a little pressure on it does make it a bit uncomfortable, so it's not numb or anything... It's just... Almost normal?

I dunno, this is extremely strange to me, especially considering how much of a wimp I am, and I felt like reddit was a weird enough place to have some input on the likelyhood of either a strange complication, astronomical luck, or just the surgeon hyperbolically preparing me for the worst.",t2_hkqt4,0,Should I be concerned by a lack of pain after surgery,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12s5bfr,True,magnymbus,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12s5bfr/should_i_be_concerned_by_a_lack_of_pain_after/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12s5bfr/should_i_be_concerned_by_a_lack_of_pain_after/,475927,1681928434,0,,False,1681928448,1681928449,2023-04-19 18:20:34,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I participated in a water deprivation test to check my kidney function. I stopped eating and drinking at 6pm, like I was instructed. The following day, I captured my first urine of the day in a container and brought it in to the facility. Then I gave a second sample when I arrived at the facility. The osmolality readings were \~700 for the first one and \~720 for the second sample. I gave a 3rd sample approximately 60 minutes after the second and the osmolality dropped to \~400. The doctor told me he had never seen anything like it and had no idea why it was happening since I had nothing to eat or drink since 6pm the prior evening. At my follow up, the doctor I spoke to said it was abnormal, but not unheard of, for a person to draw fluids from other areas of the body, but that he had never seen the osmolality drop that much. I expected there to be some sort of follow up testing, but have yet to be contacted by the clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the test, I have realized that, based on the color of my urine, this seems to happen daily. Does anyone out there know anything about this or what might be causing it? I am trying to understand my symptoms and am hopeful this will give me a clue into what’s happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Various symptoms/diagnoses including the following:

Frequent urination

Fatigue

Insomnia

Tachycardia

Raynaud’s

Peripheral neuropathy 

&amp;#x200B;

All of these symptoms have gotten dramatically worse in the past 5 to 10 years. I have been evaluated by many specialists, including neurologists, endocrinologists, and autonomic specialists, but have been unable to figure out an underlying cause.

# INTRODUCTION

Hello, first and foremost I would like to thank anyone who will take the time to read this LONG (and not interesting) STORY and maybe bring some suggestions, help/advice or his own testimony if my story rings a bell. Thank you so much.

Many subjects are related to this story, so I might post on HAIR TRANSPLANT reddit, GERD etc. 

Please, do not troll me or just conclude I'm hypochondriac. In the end,  if I don’t find any answer, I’ll accept everything is psychological but my friends and family know I'm someone that is well-reasoned, down to earth and not afraid of pain. I don't make things up. However, I have always been attentive to my body, and the few moments I was sick in my life, I knew it very soon. This time, I know my body is going through something weird and hard to understand. It’s been here for 2 months, so I’m just wondering if it’s just something benign that is taking time to go or just the beginning of something more serious. 

# ___________________________________________________________________CONTEXT

&amp;#x200B;

I will bring a lot of context, because maybe it will help you understand what could possibly be wrong. A  few things might make you smile or laugh, but I’m just trying to expose as many details as I can. 

Im a 25 years old man, I don’t drink alcohol, don’t smoke. 1m70, 70kg. I’ve always been someone “healthy” I would say.  I eat everything (vegetables, fruits….), although I don’t cook much when home and sometimes eat pastas and steaks for days. I don’t do any sports, and spend a lot of time on my computer (sedentary). Yet, I walk a lot during my work or when I’m out. 

Keep in mind, I had 2 food poisoning the year before the surgery that I’m about to talk about. And my stomach has sometimes been capricious (bloatings etc) during the last few years. I've also had a ""one time hiccup"" when I swallow a piece of bread sometimes or take a sip of a soda. 

Plus, I walked on some glass with my shoes 3 months ago, I felt like I had a sort of a tiny tiny glass flake that would not come out of my feet, but could not see anything. I kept walking although I felt a little pain, then it was gone a few days after. I mention this because I’m so much looking for answers that I even thought of a microscopic piece of glass in my body, making all this mess (I know, right). 

I live in France and 2 months and a half ago I had a hair transplant surgery in Turkey (Este Nove in Istanbul). It was the first time in a plane for me. I didn’t appreciate much the experience but it was necessary, I went on my own and had the surgery. The surgery was painful sometimes and not a nice and chill moment but everything still went well, no complications. I didn’t stay much in Turkey because the day after I went back home in a plane. Edemas, hard to sleep, tiredness, sensitive head for the followings days, like most people, but overall  nothing weird I suppose, my scalp was red but healthy. 

Then, almost 2 weeks after the surgery, I was starting to feel better. I ate sushis a few days after my surgery and I ate sushis again  the day something weird happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

# ___________________________________________________________________THE EVENT

&amp;#x200B;

The day everything went crazy, I ate sushis a few hours before. Then, I went to bed to sleep, I was chilling and suddenly my heart rate went crazy. I started to have heart palpitations, cold sweat for a very short time (1 minute or 2 I think). I sat on my bed, drunk some water and tried to stay calm although I was not understanding at all what was going on because I never felt this or had a sort of tachycardia in my life I think. I had nausea also but it was manageable. 

Then, I managed to calm down and fall asleep because I was tired. 

The day after, I started to feel weird, I felt like my heart rate was always above average. The following days, I was feeling weak, had heart/chest palpitations/pain, shivers,  nausea, blood pressure high or low, short events of diarrhea and a lot of dizziness/“heavy head”. 

Therefore, I started to see my doctor. I had blood tests, nothing weird except a tiny bit of more cholesterol than my usual, ""unconjugated bilirubin""a bit above average too and creatinine just below average (6,5 mg/l).

I saw a cardiologist after a few weeks, I got several ECG and a Holter ECG (24 hours), I told my cardiologist the worst episodes didn’t happen during the ECGs, but he told me the problem was not coming from my heart and the cause is not cardiac. I asked him to do more research just in case, like an ultrasound/sonogram but he told me it was not necessary, ECGs showed nothing weird. Then, he told me to look for a gastroenterologist because maybe my symptoms are caused by a gastric issue. 

I'm now waiting to see a gastroenterologist in a month. My doctor gave me esomeprazol to see if it helps (it’s hard to tell, maybe it does but it’s not a benign medication that can also cause side effects equal to my symptoms). 

A few days ago, feeling very weak, I had a pharyngitis/cold + my right eye became red (maybe little conjunctivitis too) and I had a weird pain in my back/ the carotid area in my neck. 

All this to say, my body has been going crazy for 2 months now, symptoms come and go, some new symptoms sometimes appear (like my red eye although it’s mostly gone but I see a few more red vessels than the usual for now). 

&amp;#x200B;

# ___________________________________________________________________                        SYMPTOMS AND LEADS

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the symptoms that are gone for now or rare I think :**  

\*nausea

\*heart palpitations / bloodpressure (at least I think but I don’t take my blood pressure/heart rate all the time). However, when I do some effort I feel my heart more than before. 

\*stomach pain

**Here are the symptoms that are still mostly present (different intensities)  :**  

\*pain/pressure/discomfort in the chest/heart (“left” which makes me think it’s my heart but also right or middle). 

\*heavy head/dizziness, it’s the worst because mostly present, everyday. It’s hard to qualify, it’s not really dizziness because I don’t feel like everything is spinning but I don’t feel like myself.

\*short breath sometimes 

\*burp sometimes too 

In general, I feel like my health is a bit  “better” than one month ago (although it depends because there are some moments when  I really don’t feel well).  However, it’s hard to tell if it’s just me getting used to it or me getting better.  Plus, although I try to stay positive, I must admit I’ve never felt “normal” and without any symptoms at all since the event.

**My symptoms can correspond to so many things (or “nothing”) that it’s hard to find concrete answers, so I’m gonna make a list of several leads that could be related to my issues to try to make things more clear for me and you.** 

►Cardiac : according to the cardiologist, it’s not likely. Although I would have preferred to get an ultrasound. Plus, my family has many cardiac diseases/blocked artery , that’s why it was the first doctor I saw. Yet, they all drink alcohol and/or smoke etc. I’ve been wondering if an artery issue is always seen on  ECGs, I guess it does. 

►Magnesium/vitamins deficiency  :  taking pills for more than a month now so probably not.

►Hair transplant in Turkey : Although my scalp looks red but healthy, I wonder if maybe my body is going crazy because of this event/surgery. Weird anestesia/perfusion/virus… Or maybe an internal reaction in my head that is not visible. I’ve also been wondering that maybe a disease or health issue has been ""waking up"" because of the surgery/post surgery with antibiotics/inactivity (making my body weak). 

**►GERD Acid reflux/helicobacter pylori/gastric issues/gastric virus : I’m waiting to see the doctor. It’s most likely, regarding my food poisoning and given that everything happened a few hours after I ate sushis, but it also happened after a surgery + the antibiotics so there are many coincidences...** 

►Food intolerances : hard to tell, at first I thought symptoms were more intense during digestion or when I’m lying down but I’m not so sure anymore. 

►Big food poisoning : would be weird to have all these symptoms and for so long, but it’s an idea. 

►Psychological : although I don’t feel traumatized by the surgery (I didn’t have a good moment, but what is done is done, I don’t live the past)  and the event of tachycardia, maybe it’s just my subconscious talking to me through my body. 

►Serious diseases : cancer, tumor or else. It sounds very paranoid, hypochondriac and not likely, but my symptoms can be associated with the start of something severe.  

&amp;#x200B;

# ___________________________________________________________________CONCLUSION

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, next step is the gastroenterologist, hoping to get answers. 

After this, if the gastroenterologists says there is nothing wrong, I might ask my doctor to do a MRI scan of my chest/torso/stomach and brain and the most complete blood test possible. After this, if there is nothing wrong and the symptoms still here, I’ll just assume it’s psychological unless you have suggestions; that’s why I’m here. 

I tried to bring as many details as I remember, I hope I didn’t forget anything important. If I did, I’ll edit this. 

Thank you for taking some time in your day to read this and maybe bring a testimony/suggestion.

My dad just had heart surgery at 61 for bicuspid valve that caused heart failure and left ventricle dilation. 

My echo shows that I have:
Moderately dilated LV
Mild decreased LV systolic function
LVEF= 52%
Decel time 118msec
Mv e/a ratio of 2.1

Is this something I should get followed up with cardiology?

442,AskDocs,"Hello, kind reader. 
I am a 26-year old AMAB individual - I am roughly 6ft 1in (~1.85m) tall, and overweight - 270lbs (~123kg). For roughly 6 months, I have been inconsistently experiencing joint pain in my left leg, intially focused around where my big toe meets my foot, but more recently just below the ball of the ankle on the outside of my foot as well as (on one brief occasion) the outside and front of my lower knee. During longer periods of pain, it seems to relocate to another area once a previous area has been treated or completely stopped hurting.
The pain has been sharp/stabbing, with some pain radiating beyond the joints on irregular occasions. I have experienced some minor swelling, but the afflicted areas have neither felt hot nor been more painful when pressure was applied. I have had my foot and ankle x-rayed, and no visible issues were shown besides a crowded big toe - almost all of the pain around the toe has been alleviated completely since starting to wear a toe spacer. I was given a tentative diagnosis of possible gout, but didn't get much information beyond that. Elevation has not helped, but NSAIDs and hot water have. The pain is uniformly worse in the morning, but it has almost never been made worse by putting weight on the foot - rotating my ankle has been agonizing at times, but I can stand normally and walk with only a minor limp when pain is anything less than debilitating, which has only happened on 2 distinct and separate occasions.. I'm curious as to what possible leads I should follow. As additional information, I should note that I am a heavy consumer of alcohol (4-5 units of alcohol most days) and overly sedentary.

I strained my pec, suspected grade 2, and I see the conventional wisdom is to use a sling if necessarily. But why a sling and not a shoulder brace, or both?

I get terrible pain if I move. I can’t even sniffle without feeling stabbing pain shooting through my pec into my shoulder, arm, and back. This translates to not just major movements of the area but even tensing subconsciously to brace myself as I move unrelated parts of my body.

The one thing that helps is focusing on keeping my shoulder on that side rolled back in the “correct-posture” position. Stabilizing my shoulder (as if trying to not use my rotator cuff) seems to reduce the small movements that are making life really impossible right now.

So why on earth isn’t shoulder stabilization promoted as part of pec care immediately after the injury?

What should i apply on it to remove it.. I am from india.. So it would be easy if you provide a medication which is indian or available globally.

23 y/o Male here. I'm 5'11 and weigh 245 pounds.

So about a month ago, I went on a binge fest and started eating way too much food every night. Like multiple meals worth and then a bunch of snacks all within a few hours (due to marijuana munchies, lol) I managed to stop binge eating after about a week of doing this, and ever since then my stomach has been strange. For a few days after I stopped binge eating, after I would eat a normal portion of food I would get short of breath and could feel my body sort of vibrating. That stopped after like 2 or 3 days, but now, a few weeks later, I barely get the sensation of hunger anymore, and my stomach seems to gurgle in one particular spot (a little bit below where my left rib cage ends) My bathroom trips have been mostly normal. I'm mostly curious what I could have done to myself lol, I figured maybe I gave myself a hernia or something by overeating so much, or maybe I gave myself gastritis? I've never had a history of stomach issues before this. Also, I have not experienced any pain at all aside from getting heartburn once since this has started. It does seem like my stomach is getting a little better, but I'm still getting the weird gurgling feeling in that one spot every time I eat, usually lasting like 30 minutes or so.

I will be seeing my GP soon but wanted to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has any advice.

I have recently been suffering from 4 weeks of constant mild dizziness, balancing issues and migraine like symptoms. I was diagnosed with having fluid trapped behind my left ear drum by my doctor.

I am using inflammation ear drops, Nasal spray hourly and taking Pseudoephedrine once a day.

The medication has definitely helped but i only feel about 80%. I've also developed a tingling sensation that comes and goes across my face so I'm worried I'm doing something wrong.

My doctor said there is no treatment option and that it may take up to 3 months to subside.

454,AskDocs,"Hi, I have been having issues with going to the bathroom. Some background: I’ve had multiple head injuries, a nerve disorder called CRPS/RSD, and I used to struggle with eating disorders (never hospitalized.)

Basically, ever since my junior year of high school, I haven’t really gone to the bathroom regularly or often. I just thought it was normal. I’ve always had issues with my lower area, hemorrhaging with every single menstrusal cycle and having extremely tight psoas with my CRPS and hips being out of joint, but ever since junior year I just haven’t been able to go to the bathroom…I stopped eating much around this time but am not sure if this has anything to do with it (I eat now around 1400 calories as I am on a deficit but eat a lot of protein, fiber, am active, and drink a good amount of water.) 

I’ve tried EVERYTHING at this point, and I’m so tired of finding out every solution by myself, it just takes too long. I tried the FODMAP diet, did NOTHING. I tried miralax, NOTHING. It now takes entire bottles of magnesium citrate to move anything, but oftentimes like today, nothing. I’ve tried drinking 64+oz of water consistently, nothing. I’ve tried trulance and linzess, same problems just now with diahhrea. And they only work IF I take senakot at the same time. 

My only theory right now has been that because Senakot works by increasing muscle activity, and most of the other laxatives I’ve tried brings a lot of water to move stuff, the fact that lots of people with CRPS have issues with their pelvic floor, I immediately go to the bathroom after doing psoas stretches, I have issues with my pelvic area in general, and no diet seems to be affecting it except for removing gluten, is that perhaps there is an issue with my pelvic floor? But I’m scared that after the PFD test the doctor will find nothing :(

Basically I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas and if there are any other laxatives you could recommend because I am seriously desperate. It’s really awful to my eating disorder self to constantly be in a cycle of losing and gaining this much weight, and I just feel awful. Even playing my instrument is harder. Sex is freaking bloody as heck when I feel bloated and I have lots of pain, I will try any other laxative you could think of😭I just need brainstorming help because I’ve been trying to get doctor’s to be able to find the cause for the past six months + high school (big break from seeing a GI as I was no longer &lt;18).

Had an injury in the gym in November. Referred to surgeon, MRI and radiography, results today showed two, full-thickness tears of the infra and supraspinatus muscles. Muscle retraction with fatty infiltrates; surgery not a viable solution. I can get on board with that.
Does the fact that there’s fatty infiltrates show what my ‘fat health’ is like as a whole? E.g. if fat has infiltrated the muscle during healing, is this because there is excess fat in my body? Is it how my body utilises fat because of the big whack of glucocorticosteroid that I’m on?

50M, 6'2"" 180lbs Caucasian with shoulder issue (no substance abuse issues, or other material medical issues)

Okay, I'm transitioning to being an old person (around 50 years old).

I've taken up golf in the last year or so. And I find myself having a sore shoulder, among other things. Now it's not some horrible, aching, keeps me up at night pain at this point. It's kind of an ache that I haven't felt before, along with a little pain when I move it certain ways that are often hard to replicate (like sometimes it will be if I move it behind my back, other times above my head, etc. Occasional popping/clicking sound when I swing my arm around. Often once I move it a certain way and I get that ""click"" or ""ouch"" feeling, it seems like it loosens up. But there has also been a really low grade ache that comes and goes for a week or more now.

Here's the actual question - I'm having a hell of a hard time figuring out the difference between ""that's the start of something that could develop into a chronic injury (like rotator cuff damage) pain and  you need to back off"" versus ""Hey, you're getting older, that's just normal achiness"" pain versus ""you don't exercise/move enough, so this is exactly the type of movement you should be doing and of course it will be a little achy"" pain.

The problem is, the health care community's answer to any pain like this is always ""stop, and consult a physician."" The reality is, no one can possibly go see a physician every time they have some aches and pains. It's kind of ridiculous advice.

The other problem is, you often here ""just rest it until the pain goes away."" But that also potentially leads to just being sedentary. Like if I just rested until pain went away, I probably wouldn't ever do anything strenuous.

Am I making sense? I'm just trying to navigate this world, and I don't want to unnecessarily slow down/stop hobbies and activity, but I also don't want a hobby/activity leading to life long pain/damage because I pushed something too hard and didn't stop.

I didn't have these issues as much when I was younger, but honestly, I was also even more sedentary when I was younger.",t2_4wfbq,0,"How do you tell ""it's injured stop using it"" from ""it's sore because you're getting older"" from ""it's sore because you need to exercise it more""?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12s4go2,True,SlyFrog,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12s4go2/how_do_you_tell_its_injured_stop_using_it_from/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12s4go2/how_do_you_tell_its_injured_stop_using_it_from/,475923,1681926730,0,,False,1681926744,1681926744,2023-04-19 17:52:10,,,

After a night of drinking, I felt a stabbing pain at the base of my rib cage on my right side. This area was sore to the touch and would hit me randomly. The pain subsided after a day but I developed UTI symptoms after a couple days (pain while urinating, cloudy urine, blood in urine).

I am so confused because the ONLY thing I ate yesterday was that rice cake and a LOT of water. The only reason that my UTI has not worsened is because of all the water I’ve been drinking.

I'm a nursing student and on the 17th close to 22:00 I had a needle stick injury with it being contaminated with blood from a patient (was drawing blood, and when disposing the needle it sticked me in the finger).

**I was using gloves I** immediately washed my hands with a lot of 70% alcohol, washed my hands thoroughly and used alcohol again. The injury was very superficial, I didn't bleed but felt the needle sticking me, thus all the hand washing.  I reported the injury to my supervisor and told me to wash thoroughly my hands and not to worry.

The patient has no known infection and disease and was in the hospital for a trauma reason.

The injury is not visible and for this reason I won't post a picture.

472,AskDocs,"Hello there. This is more a question on the medical industry, more so than a personal medical issue. To give a quick background, I work as a software engineer, and I have a friend who's currently studying in med school. He'd told me recently that one of the pressing issues in medicine is that the system for filing patient information is very outdated. I'm not in the medical industry myself (so I'm not too privy as to what he'd meant by that, and he was quite frank with me that he's not 100% sure on the exact issue(s)/solutions himself), but I found it to be an interesting topic to dive into and perhaps create an app to address it and/or other concerns in the medical industry. Of course, I'm aware that, like may other industries and professions, there are a multitude of different kinds of issues, so, to be more specific, I'm looking for:

* Issues that are relevant to the user experience of those who are working in the medical field (i.e. nurses, doctors, etc.) that may be solvable through software means (mainly in the form of a web or mobile app).

* Perhaps a more detailed explanation on the issue of patient information being outdated, more from someone who's experienced it first hand, rather than someone who is still studying and in school (no offense to my friend and those who are still studying!).

Thank you in advance, and I'm looking forward to our discussions!

480,AskDocs,"I am a 1m83 uni student, not taking any medications, I don't drink or smoke or any type of drugs, the only unhealthy habit is that I sometime skip breakfast, I stay up pretty late, eat instant noodle and drink redbull every now and then(I have not been drinking redbull for around two week or so now).   


I will now tell everything that I know, I am sorry for any informal wordings because English is my second language.   
And I have been experiencing extreme stomachache whenever I go two or or more without eating anything(small snack or a meal). This has been affecting me a lot since having uninterrupted sleep has been very rare and not being able to do workouts without constantly taking a break to munch on something, mainly sleep here.   


I tried ""googling"" my symptoms which lead to the answer that I got Hunger Pangs, so what I have tried this couples of weeks is to improve my diet to eat more ""healthy thing""... But still no luck so far. Other symptoms of hunger pangs is me craving for specific foods or strong desire to eat but I don't see myself in that situation as I am currently eating food only whenever I feel the strong pain in my stomach, along with regular meal through out the day(breakfast, lunch and dinner). I also don't feel any heartburn at all too. My appetite are normal. No symptons of nausea. I did had mouth ulcer recently but mouth ulcer happens very rarely for me. Also drinking water somewhat help with the pain, so i have been drinking a lot of water recently.  


Another noticable changes in my day to day life is that my stoll and my flatulence have a much, much stronger smell.  


Two months ago I also fainted which lead me to the hospital, they said to just come back if anything occurs again. They didn't told me what caused it since all they did is passing some water into my body and I felt much better, which lead me to believe the cause of me fainting is dehydration. During that visit I got my stool checked since I had a suspicions that maybe my stool contain blood, which it does not, they told me.   


**TLDR:** Stomach pain when hungry, smelly stool, no heartburn, constant need of eating to not feel pain, but i dont actually crave for eating, i only eat so i dont feel pain :(

489,AskDocs,"Age: 22. Sex: Male. Height: 5""8. Weight: 125. Duration of Complaint: 3 years. Medication: Auvelity. Issue: Anhedonia/Sexual Anhedonia.

Hello,

For almost 3 years now I've been dealing with Sexual Dysfunction and Emotional Numbness. 

Regarding the sexual dysfunction I have Erectile Dysfunction. I no longer wake up in the morning with an erection and I also no longer get erections throughout the day.

My sex drive is gone. I no longer feel any sexual arousal, desire, or attraction.

I also notice that I have reduced sensitivity to my penis.

With the emotional numbness, my emotions have been stripped from me. I feel like a zombie 24/7. I can no longer feel strong emotions like adrenaline, arousal, pleasure, etc. I can't laugh like I used to.

Other symptoms I have in addition to this are a reduced appetite, muscle aches, and brain fog.

These symptoms all began after an intense and chronic episode of stress, depression, and anxiety.

It's like that episode caused inflammation to my body and brain chemistry.

I no longer feel stressed, anxious, or depressed but I am still left with these symptoms of emotional numbness and sexual dysfunction.

Two practitioners brought to my attention that I may be dealing with Anhedonia.

I've been seeing a Psychiatrist to address that.

My Psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin. I was on Wellbutrin for 6 months. I started off at 150MG, then 300MG, then 400MG. The Wellbutrin didn't help. Then he paired the Wellbutrin with Rexulti and I still felt no effect. He then had me try Trintellix and that didn't help. He currently put me on Auvelity and I've been taking it for 8 weeks. I don't feel a difference on it.

I follow up with my Psychiatrist next week and I am going to have to tell him that the Auvelity is not helping.

I’ll start off by saying I’m a medical student, with a degree in microbiology… so I’m pretty familiar with bugs. However, I’ve convinced myself I’ve contracted HSV from a sexual encounter. 

I had protected intercourse twice in the last few weeks. Unprotected oral sex once in that timeframe. Generally safe sexual history. Wearing protection for first encounters, regular STI testing. No hx of STI or immunosuppression. I wore tight pants/underwear and believe I chaffed the head of my penis, but I’m in my own head now.

I have 2 red spots probably 2 mm each on the ridge of the head of the penis. Not blisters, not ulcers, do not seem to be open wounds. They felt like I chaffed some skin and got better in a day. They realistically don’t hurt anymore and appear pretty healed. But if I get inside my own head I can imagine pain, but it’s not present as soon as I think about other things.

I have an identical pair of marks in the opposite side of the head as well. I put my pants on and they are right where the seams would rub as well. After the first encounter I freaked out, put rubbing alcohol all over genital area. Yes this was dumb, but for some reason I’m incredibly paranoid about HSV. So my logical progression is alcohol on skin (especially such a sensitive area) -&gt; drying out area -&gt; chaffing.

No “dew drops on a rose appearance”, doesn’t hurt to pee, no sores anywhere else, the area in question was covered by the condom both times. I don’t feel ill or have tender noticeable lymph nodes.

Based on the symmetry of the marks, location (especially covered by the condom), lack of associated symptoms… I can reason with myself that it’s nothing to be worried about, then I jump to m conclusions.

I don’t have pictures, they would be pretty unremarkable. Especially based on everything I could find in UpToDate, research papers, my textbooks. To be frank, it looks like the first picture of balanitis on google. Except maybe a littler “fresher” and I’m not uncircumcised and do not have any other associated symptoms.

I just want to be talked off my metaphorical ledge.

493,AskDocs,"Hello! I (28f) am a professional pianist with a nerve issue that I’ve been experiencing off and on for the past 6 years. I haven’t seen a doctor about yet, and the reason is because 1. I would want to see someone who is knowledgeable or even specializes in injuries related to musicians, which I have no idea who that would be, and 2. it only flairs up occasionally, maybe once a month, always when I’m practicing for hours at a time, so it’s not exactly an emergency situation.

Here is the specific issue: when my hand is stretched out and tense in order to hit rapid octaves or large chords, suddenly the nerve in my right hand (I think it runs down the left side of my wrist down to my thumb) will experience a sudden burst of tingling sensation, as if a tendon or ligament has rubbed over it suddenly. It isn’t painful at all and never has been, but the sensation is extreme and disruptive, uncomfortable enough that I immediately feel I need to stop playing. Usually I will go take a break after it happens. This issue first began during my last year of undergrad, when I was experiencing a lot of stress which manifested as physical tension, which I believe must have created this injury. At the time the tingling was happening constantly. I had to take a few weeks off from playing, and it did get better, but has never gone away fully. 

My question is—does anyone have any advice on whether this is something a doctor could even help me with or fix? And if so, what kind of specialist would I even see?

504,AskDocs,"So this is the state of desperation me and my family are in, I’m praying doctors or pathologists of Reddit see this post and someone maybe has some suggestions. 

My husband (34M) is an 5'7""/ 335lbs (high BMI since childhood-way before symptoms started), Mediterranean man who was a former smoke (quit in 2019). For the last 2 and half years or so he has had attacks of debilitating stomach pain. He has been diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome (I cover this in the post) but has no other chronic medical conditions/diagnosis. 

These started shortly after he and I got COVID for the first time (we’ve had it twice, we were vaccinated the first time we got it and have had had all recommended vaccines). The attacks happen every 4-6 weeks on average, and typically have last between 12-72 hours. There is not real pattern/timeframe for when the attacks occur, last week he had an attack that lasted 5+ days, had 3 days of no symptoms and has symptoms again as of last night. We've journaled symptoms on and off since they started and can find no triggers/patterns in when they occur. 

During these attacks he has stabbing intense pain, when they first started it seemed to come be localized in RUQ, but mostly now in his epigastric region and can radiate throughout his abdomen. No radiating pain to flanks/back. He also feels “acid” in his throat which makes him extremely nauseous, but he doesn’t often spontaneously vomit. If he makes himself gag he gets very temporary (minutes at most) relief from the nausea. He has slightly active to hypoactive bowel sounds during attacks. He will sometimes have dry mouth during attacks, but not always. He can also have a mildly elevated temp (99.0-100.0) during attacks, though he is using a heating pad to try to relax his body/muscles which helps a tiny bit and could account for elevated temp. He also is sometimes diaphoretic during attacks, with or without using the heating pad. He’s seems sensitive to light and sound during attacks and talking makes him hurt much worse. He can’t get in a comfortable position but is most comfortable on his R side on our couch so he can lean against the back. He can’t eat during these attacks, but can sometimes take sips of water. If he eats too soon after it has subsided, it will start again, but again there is not real pattern to this or timeframe where he is ""safe"" that we've found. He is mostly normal between attacks, though he says he has low-grade and nausea and some pain when it’s not active. He also has loose and foul-smelling stools more then 50% of the time but can have normal/formed stools. He has never had a bowel movement during an attack. 

We’ve been through several GI tests, some outpatient, a handful in-patient and some of them multiple times but here is the summary: 

Upper/lower scopes: He has no structural abnormalities in his GI track, except for a small hiatal hernia that his all previous doctors say isn’t causing his problems. I’ve asked about a possible sliding hernia but that idea has largely been dismissed/ignored.  Pathology showed generalized inflammation to the colon. 

KUB: Normal.

CTAP: He’s biliary tree is appears normal, no gallstones, no masses. Possible fatty liver noted in one CTAP. 

HIDA scan (x2): gallbladder EF was normal. 

Gastric emptying study was normal. 

Stool cultures/smears are normal- he was treated for infections (Salmonella and H. Pylori) with no relief. 

We’ve tried several elimination diets including cutting gluten, most sugar, and dairy with no relief. 

In 2021, we went to the ED 18 times according to our insurance summary for that year. Every time he reports to the ER, they find nothing abnormal in tests and labs. So they suggest he’s having anxiety/panic attacks/drug seeking and sent him home. He now refused to go to the ED during attacks, since he feels he's not believed anyway. Last time he was willing to go in, we were admitted at a community hospital, during which he has an elevated ANA and was diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome. According to the community rheumatologist we saw following that hospitalization, and the university-hospital rheumatologist we saw after that, Sjögren’s is not causing the symptoms. Nothing else was identified after 5-days in patient and we were discharged. 

Labs have all been basically normal, except for slightly elevated WBC count  (not even out of normal range) x1 and a positive ANA (dx of Sjogren's). Its been 3+ months since we've had labs, so nothing really relevant to share.  

Following that hospitalization, he was treated for familiar Mediterranean fever, but that didn't seem to work. He was treated for IBS but that also didn't help. He's currently being treated for abdominal migraines, this treatment started about 10 days ago so way too soon to tell, but so far tripin has not stopped an in-progress attack. We started looking at specialties outside of GI and are currently working with a pain specialist who is the one who started the abdominal migraine treatment. He gets no relief from antiemetics or muscle relaxers. Even opioids don’t really stop they pain and we aren’t interested in long term opioid use. 

Here are the meds he's on/ been on:

No longer taking:

Duloxetine 30mg BID -took x6weeks with no effect

Dicyclomine 10mg 4x daily w/ meals and PRN during attacks- took x4 months with no relief

Cyclobenzaprine 5mg TID- took following the Bentyl, no real effect, stopped this one after only a few weeks.

Colchicine 0.6mg BID- took x6 weeks with no effect

Pantoprazole 40mg Qday- took x4months no effect

Metoclopramide 10mg PRN for nausea- never really worked

Ondansetron 0.8mg PRN for nausea- never really worked

Tramadol 50mg PRN for pain relief- no effect

Norco 5/325mg for pain relief- no meaningful effect

Currently using:

Memantine 5mg Qhs has been taking x1week too soon to tell but doesn't seem to be helping

Sumatriptan 50mg PRN during attacks- no effect but because of the nausea doesn't hold down well either.

Scopolamine transdermal patch Q72hours- helps with nausea between attacks, has been wearing x10days.

CoQ10 supplement daily

He also uses cannabis during attacks as its really the only thing that helps manage the nausea and allow him to get some rest when he is in pain. He has also done fasts of this to rule out cannabis-induced hyper emesis. Going without did not change the attacks at all and since its really our only tool he uses it when they occur.

I have made him appointments with neurologists, allergists and an endocrinologist. We’ve switched from our local hospital to a university/teaching hospital system. I just put in a request for appointments/work-up at Mayo Clinic.

506,AskDocs,"Hi,

I (28M, 175cm, white) have been having this issue for a few months now, and could not nail down a diagnosis and none of the pictures of possible infections matched mine exactly.

  
So I have had surgery for a broken arm in January, a few weeks into recovery I noticed very small white spots (pimples?) on my glans, which I was able to ""scrape"" off with a finger using water, it left was looked like tiny sores where the pimples were. I thought that was it, but ever since they have been coming back almost daily or every second day, I am wondering what could cause it? It also smells weird after a day or so, this did not use to happen.

I have had a period during recovery where I showered a bit less than usual, can it cause such a long lasting infection if I returned back to normal as soon as my cast was gone (showering atleast every 2nd day).

There isnt any pain usually, although rarely I feel some discomfort when I touch the glans or scrape the spots off, which have been appearing less often the last few days.

Currently there are no white spots but the tissue looks a bit red in certain areas.

I am uncircumcised and to me it seems to occur less severe when I keep the glans dry.

During sexual activity I use spit, could something in my spit cause it? 

Could remnants of sperm that aren´t visible to the eye cause it?

Any ideas?

About a month ago I started to experience a feeling of painful pressure in both ears that would come and go throughout the day. I also began experiencing splitting headaches that are barely touched by OTC pain meds, numbness and tingling on both sides of my body.  In particular, when I wake up, both of my hands are typically numb. Both of my heels have this really weird constant tingly feeling. 

I'm now most worried about what's going on with my ears. I went to my primary care doctor, who checked me out for an ear infection/ear wax impaction and didn't find anything. I reported the numbness, tingling, and headaches as well and the doctor told me to just wait a month and see if it gets better, then follow up. He also insinuated that it may be allergies but I have 0 nasal congestion/cough and have no history of allergies to anything. 

For my ears, I was prescribed prednisone 20mg 2x daily for 5 days. I was also given a steroid nasal spray -- can't remember which one off the top of my head. I'm on day 4 now and the problem is only getting worse – I usually wear noise-cancelling headphones at work for example, but trying to wear them right now is excruciatingly painful.

An MD at one of those rejuvenation clinics prescribed me 0.3m of testosterone cypionate to inject intramuscularly weekly.

The bottle came from a compounding pharmacy and says to discard 28 days after initial puncture, even though it has about 3 months' worth of testosterone in it.

I've not been doing this, and have instead been filling a syringe just prior to each injection. 

I just emailed her and asked for a refill (the bottle has been opened for 21 days). She responded that I can continue using it past 28 days.

512,AskDocs,"My  dad is a 68 year old Mexican (mestizo) male. At the time of his first  nosebleed, he was diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol, and  prehypertension. He's 5'6"" and weights 180 pounds. He rarely drinks and  doesn't smoke or use recreational drugs. He's prescribed metformin,  insulin, aspirin, and lovastatin but refuses to use the last two. He  also has arthritis in his elbows, for which his doctor tells him to use  ibuprofen as needed. I don't know his cholesterol levels or A1C.

About  two weeks ago now, had a nosebleed (limited to the right nostril) for  the first time in over 30 years while he was cleaning the garage. We  asked him if he accidentally hit himself, scratched his nose, or sneezed  but he insisted that it just started out of nowhere. Initially he was  able to stop the bleeding but later that same day the bleeding resumed  while he was moving some boxes (15-35lbs). We were unable to stop the  bleeding and he went to the emergency room where they tried to stop the  bleeding with Tranexamic acid and, after that failed, cocaine  hydrochloride  before ultimately applying an anterior nasal packing. His  blood pressure was checked and it was high 143/83 but the doctor said  it could be due to the stress of the situation and didn't warrant  immediate treatment (side info, he had a heart rate of 85, low 60s seems to be normal for him). He was told to go back in two days to remove it and  cauterize the affected area. He was also prescribed  cephalexin (I'm assuming to prevent opportunistic infections). Apart  from the nosebleed, he seemed fine. He was a little shook from the  experience but was feeling good. No other symptoms.

Two  days later he went to get the nasal packing removed and the doctor  determined nothing needed to be cauterized. My dad was told to be  careful for a few days and to schedule an appointment with his PCP,  which he did. He has that appointment later today. Two days after  getting the nasal packing removed, he woke up with a bloody nose that he  was unable to stop. He went to the ER again where they ended up  cauterizing his nose. He had some minor discomfort from the procedure  but was fine otherwise. He was also referred to an ENT doctor and was  able to schedule an appointment, but it's a month from now.

Since  then, he's experienced 1 more severe nosebleeding episode. He went to  the ER and got it treated with lidocaine and since his blood pressure  was higher 153/89, he was prescribed blood pressure medication  (something starting with an an L -- I don't have the documents on hand).  He was also given a nose clip and finally had some lab work done (cbc,  complete metabolic panel, and prothrombin time test -- those results  will probably be discussed today). He's since experienced two minor  nosebleeding episodes that have been effectively treated at home. In  addition, starting the day his nasal pack was removed he started  experiencing symptoms of what appears to be a respiratory infection.  This will be explained in the next paragraph.

The  day my dad got his nasal pack removed, he complained of discomfort in  the nose and sinuses. Some discomfort was to be expected but the day  after he started developing a sore throat which eventually progressed to  a dry cough, headache, coughing fits and nocturnal fever (no  thermometer available to record temperature). He went to urgent care  which prescribed him prednisone and azithromycin. It's been two days  since and there's been no change on his condition on that front. The  illness appears to be communicable since my mom started displaying  symptoms about 4 days after my dad. It's possible that he caught the bug  during Easter since we had a small gathering (&lt;8 people) though no  one else was displaying symptoms at the time or has displayed symptoms  since. My dad has been tested for both covid and the flu, for which he  has tested negative. It's also possible he caught it while seeking  treatment for his nosebleed due to the area of treatment but I'm  wondering if the two could be interrelated.

It's  concerning that after having no nosebleed or symptomatic medical issues  for so long (other than the diabetes), one would present so abruptly  and severely without any physical trauma or changes in medicine or  lifestyle habits. My questions would be what would be some of the most  likely causes of nosebleeds in someone with his medical history  (hypertension seems to be a big one)? His visit with the PCP is today.  What would be some good things to bring up or ask about in his upcoming  visit that his doctor might overlook but could be important?",t2_113usp,0,68M Recurrent right sided nosebleeds resistant to treatment followed by respiratory infection,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12s2kcg,True,not_mig,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12s2kcg/68m_recurrent_right_sided_nosebleeds_resistant_to/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12s2kcg/68m_recurrent_right_sided_nosebleeds_resistant_to/,475903,1681923133,0,,False,1681923144,1681923145,2023-04-19 16:52:13,,,

A few days ago I weighed myself after a long time, only to find out that I gained 10 kg since September 2022.

Now, I started to notice how my family and friends kept commenting about my appearance. Things like I looked healthier now, and similar. 

What bothers me is that I do not see myself healthier, only overweight. And I think they also think like that because nobody ever said to me that I was too skinny. 

To find a solution to my weight, since I can not go to the gym or exercise everyday due to studies and so, I found an app that recommended me 2/5 intermittent fasting. It said to not eat anything at all two days a week and it was the option recommended to loose weight in a more efficient way. 

So, I edited it to three days. I am currently fasting on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 

The thing is that my teacher and classmates seem to disagree with this method and keep saying things like I am sick in the head or that I will end up anorexic. 

My family is also against me, and that makes me feel betrayed. No one advised me about me gaining weight, and now that I want to go back to how I was everybody seems to have something to complain about. It almost feel like they enjoy me being fat instead of healthy. 

So I want to know, is really intermittent fasting that bad? Is it so incredible crazy of me to want to go back to my original weight?

524,AskDocs,"Before we get into it, I am safe, this is not an emergency and I am already seeking individual medical advice and diagnoses, I’m just interested to see what others think. 

I 32F collapsed at home on 10 March. It was a completely normal day and I felt absolutely fine. I was sat at my desk eating my lunch when I suddenly felt a stabbing pain in the middle of my back which spread across my chest. I started to become very sweaty and was gasping for breath. At the time I had some food in my hand and I dropped it because my hand stopped working. It’s hard to explain what happened next but I remember trying to fight the pain and a blackout and was looking at the food on the floor. I tried to pick it up but my left arm wouldn’t work and was also in a lot of pain. I then lost consciousness for an undetermined amount of time as I was on my own but it was likely no more than 10 minutes. When I came to, I was very disorientated and had a lot of aching in my arm and chest. In general I felt pretty awful. After talking with 111, an ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital. I was admitted for 2 days and I had the following tests:
- ECG
- Echo
- CT scan of my head
- CT scan of my heart
- CT coronary angiogram
- 24hr holter

All of these tests came back normal. Prior to the incident I was very fit and healthy, eating well and exercising 5 times a week (mixture of running and strength training). I was however under A LOT of stress and I have previously had physical reactions to stress in the past when everything gets too much although I have never had something like this happen. I have no underlying health conditions and am not on any medication. 

I have now been referred to a cardiologist who has done some additional tests. These have all come up normal. So we’re stumped.

I did a telehealth appointment on Sunday and the doctor prescribed me a Z-Pak but told me to wait a day or two to see if the sinusitis subsides.

I have been taking Sudafed and ibuprofen and Tylenol, and I feel like it had got to the point where it was really only painful when the Sudafed wore off. Yesterday was my first day of taking the Z-Pak and I had surprisingly painful teeth in various places for the second half of the day regardless of what I took, and today I have had a fairly constant pain in my jaw and in one tooth.

Is it normal for this to get worse again before it gets better, or should I consider going to a dentist?

I have been having moderate/severe abdominal pain for the past 5 days, sometimes going to my flank area (both sides). Anything I drink orally will intensify it, as well as running my feed will also intensify it. It will wake me up at night and prevent me from sleeping- so not really eating or sleeping. The pain is at its worse under both sides of my ribs and lower right quadrant. My abdomen is extremely tender, across my abdomen about an inch up from my belly button. There has been times that my abdomen has swelled up (could tell from my J tube being extremely tight against my skin in these moments). I had my tube changed on Friday as the balloon had ruptured (almost always an easy in-and-out procedure, there were no issues). I began Reglan about a month ago. The lower right quadrant pain has been dull and coming-and-going for about a month. Could feel it when it was aching but never really thought much of it. 
Tylenol extra strength does not even touch the pain. I described my pain to my partner as similar to being post my “big” surgery (having been cut open from sternum to my bikini line with 28 staples) and overdue for pain meds. Like all of my internal organs had been manhandled and thrown back into my body. Just curious if anyone has any thoughts on what could be going on and if it’s worth heading to the ER.

I’ve tried plenty of things for my bad breath, yet the licking my wrist test says that it’s still somewhat there. I’ve used Flonase because I have sinus history (It worked for my runny nose but not bb). I tried antacids incase it had to do with reflux. My dentist says it’s not teeth or gum related but I still have tried things such as coconut oil pulling and tongue scrapers. 

I decided to go see a holistic care specialist where they sell these non pharmaceutical products. I bought those two silver products as well as ortho biotic probiotics. After using them last night I woke up today with what seems to be improved breath compared to other mornings. Now I did also try brushing my tongue with baking soda yesterday so maybe it was that, but I’m thinking that one of these weird products that they sold me may actually work. If it’s the probiotic then good because that one isn’t too sketchy. The other two products however are freaking me out. They said it uses a different grade of silver that doesn’t lead to those side effects like turning your skin blue, however, I’m still very skeptical. Because it’s not FDA approved I can’t get a second opinion on the products from anyone, so if anyone can please give me any advice, I’d truly appreciate it.

Hi,

I hope that someone can help me troubleshooting... I'm running out of ideas. 

I'm in the process of lowering my basal (Tresiba). By now, I'm down to 20. Even less yesterday (16) cause I was running late and had to change pens. 3 weeks ago, I was at 25 units, and only dropping slightly during the day. 

My food for today: 45g of almost pure sugar, 45g of longer acting carbs. No bolus at all.

History of Hypothyroidism 

My whole life I have had what I think seems to be Eustachian Tube Dysfunction.  When I exercise, all the sudden I can hear myself breathing really loudly in my ears and it takes a few mins to go away.

I have also had ringing in my right ear only for a few years now, it seems a little louder than usual.

Now, for a few months in my right ear, I get crackling noises when I hear certain loud noises. So if someone is talking loudly my ear will crackle everytime they speak. It also feels clogged and I feel like I constantly have to do the valsalva maneuver. Occasionally now I am also getting ringing in my left ear but it will go away in a few mins but it happens multiple times a day. 

Everytime I go to the doctor, they say my ears looks fine. I went to an ENT recently who said that I probably have eustachian tube dysfunction and to do saline rinses everyday and it doesnt seem to be helping. He also said to take flonase everyday for the rest of my life. 

Is there something else besides flonase forever? Does it seem like thats really all that is going on?

I am not the type to go to concerts or listen to loud music. I have not been exposed to that much loud noise in my life besides dog barking at animal hospitals I have worked at in the past.

My T4 has been a little low recently, and a few months ago it was too high So my does was lowered. So I get bloodwork again soon to see if I need another dose change. I have no idea if that would have anything to do with it.

536,AskDocs,"My 4 year old daughter (31 pounds, 3'2"", no medication except daily 2 tsp PEG3350 for chronic constipation/withholding) normally urinates only twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. 

She refuses to go anymore than this and occasionally she will even only urinate once a day.

The other day she refused to pee in the morning and didn't go until about 4 PM.

She doesn't drink much water during the day. We encourage drinking more, but can't force her, especially since both parents work full-time.

She is partially potty-trained, in that she never has pee accidents anymore and only very rarely have pooping accidents (maybe twice a year with diarrhea), but she still needs help getting up the toilet, wiping, etc.

She is very selective about who she allows in helping her go to the toilet (my husband and I) and will hold it in the whole day until we get off work.

I myself pee multiple times a day and can't imagine how she can only pee once or twice a day. 

We have seen a several doctors for this and they mentioned that she was likely constipated and that could cause the pee holding. We have given her the PEG 3350 since she was 2 for this issue.

She poops probably about 2 to 3 times a week, but sometimes everyday and rarely once a week. We noticed that she holds in the poop and only lets a small amount go at a time.

I'm worried about her lack of peeing causing an infection, but I'm not sure what to do. Could there be more serious issues with peeing only twice a day?

Hi everyone,

So about 3 days ago my lower right abdomen starting aching dully. It's hard for me to explain the type of pain, but it's very similar to how abdominal period cramps feel... so it's not sharp, and it doesn't feel like a regular injury, but it's extremely uncomfortable. It's very similar to how diarrhea cramps feel, if that makes sense. 

I had my last period less than 2 weeks ago so I don't think it's that. I'm not on birth control at the moment either so my cycles should be regular. I am not pregnant. I was wondering if maybe I had diarrhea, but my bowel movements have been fine. Urination has been also okay and non-painful. I'm not sure what's up.

...Applying a heat pack seems to help, but that could also be in my head (it's a comforting feeling either way). I'm scared to take Advil since I'm worried about ulcers or something. I've never had one diagnosed, but for the past year I've not been able to eat spicy foods like I used to so I want to be safe. 

When I stand, I think it's worse? Maybe? Again, it's hard to tell. But, going outside and wandering around right now is difficult. The ""cramps"" are pretty rough. 

Starting 2 days ago I also began getting random SUPER dizzy spells, usually late at night. I was playing video games with my partner last night and got one really bad one that felt like I was going to be knocked out. They last maybe 5 seconds? Then I'm fine. I don't think it's stress because I've been done all my finals for like a week now, and have been (generally) feeling pretty swell mentally. My diet has remained the same as normal. These spells occur about twice a day and as I said, basically only at night.

So I'm asking here because I'm really worried about why these marks are appearing, having started a few months ago, as well as how far these marks will spread - they're also starting to appear on my sides and inner thighs. Some feel indented, whereas others are protruding slightly with a slightly rougher texture than the rest of my skin. 

Although my doctor has said its stretch marks, the shape of the marks is oddly like veins which has me concerned it's something else due to all my medical conditions listed below. So with that being said, I'd love some more opinions from you lovely lot!

My personal details - I'm a 30 y/o male in the UK, 6 ft 3 inches, 115.4 kg, White British in England. I don't smoke and only drink alcohol once a week. 

For my medical history, I have Factor V Leiden and May-Thurners Syndrome, which has led to one major DVT (2018) and one minor DVT (2023), the 2nd one leading to a stent being fitted two months ago on my left side, next to where the marks are occurring. I wear a full closed-toe compression stocking on my left leg, and am now on Warfarin 6mg once daily - I switched from Rivaroxaban a month ago.

I am also going to the gym a lot more regularly in the past week or two, and although these marks started appearing well before this, they have started to become much more prominent. I have also started intermittent fasting last week.

This is something that keeps happening, i just woke up from another one so I’m still shaking. 
Situation: This ex friend of mine screwed me over in a lot of ways. He also kinda stalked me showing up to my place any time i’d try to stop talking to him, multiple places i lived. Eventually i was in a situation where i needed a roommate and i had no one else so i let him move in. About a week in i found out it was a huge mistake as i would be followed all around our place every waking moment of the day (he wouldn’t leave me alone, example: I’d go lay in my bed to try to get away and he’d just come lay next to me, or follow me around sitting next to me leaving me with 3 inches of personal space) and wake up to him pounding on my door in the early morning “wondering what i was doing, let him in, I’m being weird, ect” Shit was giving me horror movie feels so eventually i moved out of state to escape a thousand miles away so generally after about a year I finally feel safe after months of paranoia of him finding me. When i left i did something bad. This dude caused me so much fear, anxiety, self doubt, took girlfriends, and his unbelievable inflated ego finally pushed me to leave the town i loved in fear, so I told everyone in town before i left his horrible secret: he had sex with an animal when he was younger. My ultimate revenge as his ego and image are the most important things in his life. 
Tonights Dream: i was at my dad’s house waiting for him to get home, when this ex friend shows up knocking on the glass door wanting me to let him in. I talked to him through the door feeling sketched out saying “I can’t let you in til my dad gets back.” So i go into the other room (i guess i was cleaning) when i hear him come in. Immediately i know he’s there to kill me with a knife, so i lock the door and grab a revolver as my dad owns a lot of guns. I fear this revolver isn’t enough so i frantically look for his AR or a 12 gauge. While I’m readying myself i hear him screaming for me, all I remember hearing is “JOSHUA! YOU’VE FUCKING RUINED ME! WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?!” Then i wake up before he comes into the room I’m in forcing me to shoot in self defense. 
What do i do? This is a reoccurring dream setting and it leaves me drenched in fresh paranoia and sweat. I don’t have insurance so I can’t afford therapy.

3. I've taken this dosage of percocet before, and it was too strong (nausea and a very not-fun high), but also wore off too fast (1-2 hours before I could take another). The prescription says 1 pill every 4 hours, which is definitely too much for me. The pharmacist said I can cut them in half, which should solve the ""too strong"" problem. With only taking a half pill, can I take them more frequently to also solve the ""wearing off too fast"" problem? I think a half (or even quarter) pill every 2-3 hours would work much better for my body.

I noticed this 3 days ago and thought it was just a smudge that'll brush off when I take a bath. Until now however, it's there. I don't recall hitting it or getting hit with something.

I work out at home, so I was thinking maybe it's linked to that? But not really sure. I also don't feel any pain on it when moving my arm or lifting something or pressing it, so don't know if it's serious or not.

547,AskDocs,"I’m a 29M in the US, on Vyvanse 50mg and Finasteride 0.25mg.

So for the past 4.5 years I’ve had tinnitus because apparently I have terrible genetics that gave me weak ears that crumbled at maybe a quarter of the loud noise exposure of most people I know my age (29) that don’t have any hearing damage. I didn’t get the chance to get steroids or anything. Starting around Feb 2020, I started having random episodes where I wake up in the morning with double hearing—I listen to music and hear different pitches in ear which makes it sound like a detuned mess (my left ear is hearing the wrong, lower pitch), which is a nightmare as a musician. I would say at this point I’ve had maybe about 10-12 of these episodes, they occur every 2-3 months, and I’m having one right now. Typically the double hearing goes away in the afternoon, but it’s still really anxiety-inducing. I’ve seen ENTs and my PCP and none of them really seem to do know what to do since it’s such a unique problem. I got a hearing test done after the first episode in Feb 2020 and it showed mild hearing loss at high frequencies. I’ve also had my ears cleaned Since then I’ve tried really hard to protect my ears, but I can only do so much when I’m trying to produce music. I was producing last night with Apple over the ear headphones but I kept it at half volume or under. A few questions: 

1) Is there anything I can do to minimize these episodes ?

2) Am I ever gonna be able to perform music live? 

3) Is there anything I should do right now? I’ve heard this can be a sign of an ear infection but my doctors haven’t suggested that’s the case when they’ve examined my ears. I’ve gone to urgent care/PCP a couple of times when this has happened and the most they did was clean out my ears or (like the last time in January 2023) just inspect them and find there was no excess earwax). One of my ENTs couldn’t really come up with an explanation other than that “sometimes the ears get so inflamed.”

4) If I were to get the Eargasm earplugs for musicians would it be okay for me to wear them under my headphones while producing?

On Saturday 08/04/2023 I woke up what I thought was a hangover the previous night before I had drank 3 cocktails and 1 beer from a can. Prior to this I took a a few weeks off from drinking alcohol and started to eat healthy. Going back to Saturday I woke up with pounding in my head which resulted in being a migraine. I went out and tried to have a normal day however on the car ride home the left side of my face went numb and this sent me to pure panic and fear I felt faint. When I got home I fell to the floor from panic and ended up having a panic attack and nearly called 999 I was the most scared I’ve ever been. 

Since then I have felt out of my body. Pressure in my head, eyes, and ears mostly left side. The side of my jaw is tense and my cheek left side feels really tight. I have been feeling very dizzy like vertigo that would come in waves at random points in the day. I have had stiffness in my neck and like a warm feeling in my neck going to my head. Eyed feel heavy and weak and sleepy. Feeling very exhausted. Feeling spaced out and wooshy feeling in head. Slight tightness in chest and breathlessness. Heart palpitations. Pain in arms. Pain in legs. Leg feels numb when walking when I’m feeling out of body and disconnected from myself. 

It’s only today and yesterday most of these symptoms have calmed down I have seen two doctors. First doctor listened to me and gave me pain killers for headaches / migraines. Referred me to a neurologist (which will take a long time due to waiting list. And sent me for a blood test which I went this Monday. Second doctor didn’t want to listen to every symptom I have listed in my notes and straight up said it’s anxiety and prescribed me with propranolol. Yet to take one as I am nervous about these.

Still have slight pressure in the left side of my head and sometimes a sharp pain or just discomfort. Is this anxiety or something more?

549,AskDocs,"I (31 male, 205 lbs, non smoker non drinker). Have been having on and off upper right abdominal discomfort for the last 3-4 years. Maybe longer. I had an ultrasound 2 years ago. It states my liver was borderline enlarged, and that my gallbladder walls were normal to borderline thickened (2.1-3.2mm). I had a ct scan a year later. It stated that everything was normal, no enlarged liver, but it was within normal limits and smooth, it also stated the gallbladder walls were normal. Pretty much contradicted the ultrasound. My liver enzymes have been normal to very slightly elevated, like alt and ast upper 40s to lower 50s. But that’s random. I used to take some testosterone and anastrozole and hcg. But have currently stopped and am only taking hcg. 

January 2022 I tore my pec in a jiu jitsu match. After the surgery, I stopped taking all test, anastrozole and hcg. I noticed that since I wasn’t working out and wrestling the pain was virtually never coming up again. 

About 8 months after the surgery, I decided to go back on trt. The discomfort would be there occasionally, but never concern. A few weeks ago, I had crazy deadlines, and my dog passed away. I haven’t been this stressed in a long time. I wasn’t eating, and I dropped about 5 lbs. the discomfort came back. 

I went and saw my doc. He asked about it, I told him everything, he also knows I was on trt. He said he would order a HIDA scan. I got gravely concerned. I asked if we should do anything else, suggested a biopsy. He laughed and said he’s not ordering me a biopsy. 

Currently, I decided to stop trt, except to keep using hcg at his digression to get my testicles back up to speed.

My mum (53F) has recently been in and out of hospital  with vomiting, weight loss (not sure if that's not from eating), constipation, pain++ in bowels, hard lump in bowel, and a fistula.

Long story short they found out she has a tumour which is causing her fistula. She still needs a biopsy and our family are all worried. She has been on HRT for a few years. 

Today she had an MDT meeting and they said they can't do the surgery to remove the bowel into a stoma and the same with the bladder and then remove the tumour. So they're doing keyhole to sort out the stoma and things first.

I've been told 2 things by my parents my mum Said it can't be removed as it's too close to the pelvis and my dad told me it's attached to her pelvis...they haven't asked grading or questioned anything. I'm thinking it's stage 3 which I know has good outlooks (usually). She's then going to have radiotherapy and then  have it surgically removed. But the doctor has said if they find anything else she will be made comfortable aka palliative. I'm absolutely devastated.

Any advice or help would be really appreciated, as I can't wait till after the surgery and this is all eating me alive as I'm not NOK and can't ask my dad is NOK and he's a mess and can't tell information correctly and asking isn't on his mind.

Trigger Finger:

I have it in the middle finger of my right hand. My assumption is RSI from the computer. Stopped using a mouse for a while, stretched, wore splints, etc. Got better but has plateaued.

I hear a common treatment a steroid injection. I don't have a PCP.

What type of medical professional should I look for?

Consultation:

I haven't been the doctor in a very long time. A solid argument could be made for ""never in my adult life"".

While I don't have anything major wrong with me - there are things I would like to discuss. The few times I've been before felt...rushed? I would like to establish a relationship. Talk about some stuff and maybe come up with a plan. Doesn't feel like that's the type of thing that happens in a random ""I need a checkup"" appointment.

Am I wrong? If not, is a consultation type of appointment a thing? Should I just tell the person scheduling I would like additional time?

Bonus Question:

I don't know how any of this works. I grew up in a small town. We had a small clinic with one doctor. You went there and if it was more serious she referred you to the big hospital a few towns away. So, in my head hospitals are for serious things and the doctors there aren't they type you just make an appointment with.

Hi All, I hope your all well. 

I would be most grateful if someone can help  explain to me the terms used in this MRI result (I have copied it out below) and what it means. My local hospital have not phoned me to explain and have simply sent me letter with medical speak on it, which makes zero sense to me and is causing me a lot of anxiety as I can't get hold of the team. 

I know I need to speak to them too, but I have a long history with this hospital of them not listening to my concerns, so I always need to be proactive with them. I can understand basic scientific terms to A level standard, but no expert in breast care and I have no experience of MRI radiology. 

I have previously had two seperate concurrent endometriod cancers both caught early at Stage 1 which have been sucessfully removed. No other cells found in surrounding tissue. Prognosis good.

Am going through adjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy and have had surgical menopause. No BRCA gene. 

I had a breast MRI last year which found a indeterminate lesion and lateral enhancement on the right side and some thickening of the breast.

As you can see from below, this lesion is still there, but they have said it is now less defined and a lymph node is reactive now too by the looks of it. 

I know from my previous cancers that after coming off the nexplanon implant something went seriously wrong with my estrogen levels. I went from less than a natural size 6 to a size 10 in a year and my periods slowed down to a stop. I had a million scans and three hysteroscopys over two years, before I was diagnosed with womb cancer. All the saline dilation I think pushed cancer cells into my ovary, hence I ended up with a endometriod cancer in my ovary too which was diagnosed three months later.  

Therefore, I am concerned that whatever caused this insane instance of unopposed estrogen could have also caused a cancer to arise in my breast too. 

The breast oncologist in charge of my care really doesn't think there is anything wrong with me and that I have anxiety. I have made it clear that my anxiety is an effect of having cancer at 33 and medical gaslighting for two years, rather than the cause of my problems.

I pray I don't have another cancer 🙏 but it took this same hospital two years to diagnose my previous cancers and I am really concerned that they are going to miss something again. 

If anybody could share their thoughts with me would be most appreciated. 

I can see from these notes that the lesion is less defined - could this be because im on Carboplatin? Could that destroy a benign or non benign cyst? Also what is a ductus? 

If anybody can help me would be much appreciated! 

Xx

Sometimes when walking the middle of my thigh on the front side gives me a weird sharp pain almost like hair is being pulled. I can scratch the surface of my skin there and it doesnt hurt. Only hurts when i move my leg and use those muscles. Could this be ingrown hairs or a muscle issue? I am stupid tall so maybe my muscles are too stretched?

In July of 2022 I had emergency laparoscopic surgery for a cyst twisting my left ovary, endometriosis was found also. I was in serve pain after the surgery but told I had a low pain threshold. 

I kept presenting back to emergency 4-5 times. I was unable to work and struggled with any PADLs My gyni had pretty much told me I was drug seeking. Keep in mind this was the first time I’d ever had an S8 and to make matters worse I work with the surgeon on a surgical floor. 

Once admitted I spoke to a pain specialist. He diagnosed me with nerve damage to the left Ilioinguinal nerve. 

I’ve had 2 radio frequency nerve deviations to the nerve near the left surgical site aprox 7cm above in line with the nerve. I also had one on my left lumber at t12-l1 with no improvement 
I’ve tried a ketamine infusion but reacted badly. 
I’ve had a lignocaine infusion with slight benefits. 
Currently in hospital now having one so far nil improvement. 

My nerve pain has now become Complex regional pain. I work when I can but generally spend all day not moving so I can do a shift and then come home In 8-9/10 pain where my PRN medication doesn’t help

I’ve been told by my specialist there is nothing else he can do for me in regards to my pain and referred me to another specialist who I have to fly 2hrs to see (I’m in Australia) to have a trial nerve stimulator and if that’s successful I will have one implanted 3-4 months later. 
I currently take gabapentin 900mg TDS

Hello. I have been dealing with some dryness in my genital area because of naturally dry skin and frequent intercourse. A couple of months ago I noticed these slightly raised purple spots showing up in multiple different places on my penis.

I had sex with two different partners before I received the Gardasil-9 course, but both of them were vaccinated. I have had sex with one new partner since I have been vaccinated, and they’re vaccinated too. I do not have a history of genital warts or any other STIs.

This title is kinda confusing so let me explain.

If I, for instance, hit my arm on a doorknob slightly the pain is Bad. I can remember this pain being not so painful in the past. But it’s bad, and it hurts for a while.

Even when I scratch my back or hit it on something it leaves a lingering pain that’s so intense I almost wanna cry. 

This morning my dog, about 10 pounds, jumped on my stomach and the outside (nothing internal) hurt so bad I did cry.

In 2012 (11 years ago) I was putting a metal roof on my friends cabin. I hit my thumb hard with a hammer accidentally. The thumbnail got black and blue but stayed on. A few months maybe 6mo after the injury, the nail looked roughly like it does now. The black streak is always there and under the nail there is that odd bump that I can clip off with a nail clipper but the bump remains under the nail. It’s uncomfortable putting pressure on the area and somewhat uncomfortable applying form pressure with the thumb… but otherwise it’s ok. I figured it would grow out but it hasn’t.

Echocardiogram in 2022 showed size at 4.6cm, CT scan in March measured the aneurysm at 4.7CM. Echocardiogram last week measured it at 5.0cm.

In March I had an episode of chest pain, pressure and elevated BP. I measured my BP at the start of the episode and it read 148/95. It was still at 148/95 when I arrived to the ER. They performed a CT scan to check and make sure I wasn’t having a dissection, which I was not. My surgeon is currently out of town.

My question is whether or not, however uncommon, can an aneurysm jump 3mm in a month? Did this happen perhaps as a direct result of the BP event in March? My cardiologist didn’t seem this to be likely, however I would like to get the opinion of another cardiac doctor or surgeon, while I await the return of my surgeon.

Been in and out of the doctors and all my blood work is normal, so we can’t figure out what’s going on.

My worry is I’m defending my masters thesis on Monday. I’ve heard prednisone can cause anxiety and brain fog and a bunch of other things but can also make people feel great. I’m already a pretty anxious person and hate hate hate public speaking (shaky knees, heart rate goes crazy, etc.) so I don’t know what to do.

For almost a year now I’ve had this weird sensation on the left side of my abdomen right under my ribs. A numb woozy feeling. I had a CT scan a few months back that showed nothing but the weird sensation continues. Was told to just take aspirin but it does nothing. My gut feeling continues to tell me that something is wrong so it just continues to spike up my anxiety. 

For the past months in the same area it’s turn too having dull pains that radiates to the back, whenever I press on the area it’s a weird popping feeling (like when you press on a plastic water bottle and pops back into place). Pain gets worse with food, and doesn’t really change with movement, I just wait it out until it subsides. Any idea what it may be?

600,AskDocs,"To start, we have another appointment with the pediatrician, and I’m going to get an appointment with his allergist as well to explore that avenue. I’m just casting a wide net with posting here to consider all possibilities.

Age: 18mo
Sex: Male
Race/Ethnicity: White non-Hispanic
Height: 33.5 inches
Weight: 27.5lbs
Duration of issue: On and off for two weeks
PMHx: Born at exactly 37w due to maternal preeclampsia, reflux from 2mo to 7mo treated with prescribed liquid Pepcid, eczema
Medications: liquid Zyrtec 2.5mL BID (has not been given in about a week due to suspicions of it causing the vomiting, but will be resuming today)
Allergies: Eggs (tolerates eggs thoroughly cooked in a flour matrix, but not straight eggs), dogs (dog present in the house, but his allergic reaction to her is if she licks his face)

About two weeks ago, my son had an episode of projectile vomiting while we were shopping. He brought up everything until it was just bile. Oddly enough he wasn’t distressed before or after. We got home, and he had a massive watery blowout poop. I got him washed, chalked it up to him having gotten something with eggs in it, and thought no more of it.

About a week later, I went to get my son out of bed to find him and the crib covered in vomit. After getting him cleaned up, he had another blowout. This happened again the next day, complete with runny, mucousy diarrhea. Suspecting maybe he had developed a new allergy, we checked over his diet the previous days, and cut out milk as it was a common factor. The next day, same thing. He vomited sometime overnight, about three hours after he had been out down, per the recordings of the crib camera. Several mucousy diarrhea episodes. We made a same-day appointment with the pediatrician, and decided to cut out wheat and hold his Zyrtec as that was another common factor, and it had been increased from 1.875mL PRN to 2.5mL BID several days before the vomiting episodes had started. The day of his appointment he spit up on and off, but no outright vomiting. He was not in any distress or apparent discomfort. He was eating and drinking fine. Continued to play as normal.

The pediatrician’s PA checked his ears and did an abdominal exam, both were unremarkable other than very active bowel sounds. She said he seemed to be in good health, so she ordered a BMP, CBC w/ diff, and a CRP.

The PA called me back the following Monday (4/16) to discuss the blood work, and said that the only thing that really jumped out at her was the elevated Eosinophils and low Neutrophils, and suggested the vomiting was allergic in nature. She recommended following up with his allergist. We had no issues over the weekend. I decided to try him on wheat again, and yesterday morning I gave him a few ritz crackers with his breakfast. He tolerated that fine, with no discomfort, nausea, vomiting, messy stools, etc. He ate some (egg-free) breaded chicken tenders and peanut butter on toast for dinner. He had some dry multigrain cheerios about half an hour before bed. Right before bed, I noticed a couple small hives on his temple, and wiped the area with a baby wipe in case it was from the dog, and the hives went away in about fifteen minutes. To be in the safe side, I gave him 3.75ml of benedryl before I put him to bed at 10pm.

Judging from the crib camera, he vomited again, just once, around 8:30 am. Long after he had eaten his dinner the previous night (around 6:30). The reactions are similar to how he reacts with eggs, but I am 100% certain he’s not been exposed to eggs. I thought maybe it was wheat, but there was such a long time period between when he consumed the food containing wheat and when he vomited. Is it possible for a reaction to something he ate to be so delayed? Is it possible that something else is at play?

For the last 4/5 years I've been dealing with a condition that I can't seem to find any answers for and it's really driving me to the edge of sanity. It's episodic. It last for up to a few weeks then vanishes for 4 to 6 months like nothing ever happened. The range of symptoms are wide but consistent with each episode.

**Consistent Symptoms during an episode:**

It always starts off with pressure in the glands of my neck(not swollen just pressure), pressure in my ears and behind my eyes. Then dizziness, brain fog, my brain feels like a concrete balloon, extreme fatigue and hunger. Painful armpits. Then painful and sensitive testicles.

As the days continue my back and what feels like all my organs begin to hurt. My heart feels like it's always racing. I get palpitations. I get numbness and pins and needles in arms and extremely weak.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inconsistent Symptoms during an episode:**

Itching on hands and ankles that turn in to deep scabs. Loss of vision. Ringing in ears. Nausea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I was laughed out of an ER when this for started happening and I thought I was dying. I got an MRI on my head that came back clear. My GP last time told me they are out of options and I'll never know what's wrong which I'm not ashamed to admit caused me to burst in to tears on the spot. I keep getting blood tests that come back clear but it's been difficult to get the blood tests done during an episode. 2 Blood tests did come back high in iron and a dna test did say I was positive for hereditary hemochromatosis. Could this be the culprit?

Been seeing current neurologist for maybe half a year, being worked up for what was now diagnosed as Lupus by a separate rheumatologist, epileptic seizures, &amp; migraines. I experience numbness and tingling all over the body in flares, but very frequently in hands, feet &amp; neck.


Question/Complaint:
Everytime i have asked my neurologist about treating my migraines it has been dismissed very quickly. Within the last year i have been having migraines at least 2x a month that start with numbness and tingling in my face, left ear, and neck, and eventually the migraine (pain) will hit on the left side of my face. The numbness and tingling comes along with weakness and spreads to my arm on the left side. My speech and input etc. are affected for the day.

I'm aware that i am **not** having a stroke, i have had 2 brain MRI's that according to neurologist came back normal. Is there any reason i am being told to go to the ER for this and not have the migraines investigated outpatient?

From 2012-2020 I had reoccurring tonsil infections after contracting mono, and every time my strep test was negative, but doctors still prescribed me amoxicillin, which sometimes helped get rid of the white patches, but from 2017-2020 I had a continuous white spot that would never go away on my right tonsil, and doctors never really took it seriously since I had a history of mono and strep tests were negative. Between all this tonsil stuff, in 2014 I had my first child and tested negative for all STI/D’s, and in 2019 I had my second child and tested positive for chylamidia. So my ex spouse had an affair sometime between 2014-2019, and I’m not sure how long I had the STI for. It was treated with a z pack and never reoccurred. In 2020 my tonsil with the permanent white spot started bleeding, so an ENT diagnosed it as a tonsil cyst and gave me an adenotonsillectomy, and said my infection was deep in my tissue, so I would take longer to heal than usual because he had to go deeper than for most people. Healing wasn’t as bad as I expected, though.

Fast forward to 2022 my throat still looked great, but I developed chronic right ear pain and went to a different ENT in my new location who said there was no fluid or infection in my ear, did a nose scope down my throat, and ordered a ct scan. Everything is normal on all (thankfully). He recommended a dentist who specializes in TMJ, so I’m waiting for my teeth cleaning appointment to ask about TMJ, and if my dentist handles it.

However, this morning I woke up with a very sore throat, and my ear pain is amplified on the right side. I’m wondering if the tonsil cyst could have caused nerve damage to ear, and that’s why it doesn’t show on the scan, or when he did the scope?

On April 2, I took plan B and experienced some light brown spotting days after. However, by April 7 I started bleeding heavily to the point where I was soaking through pads very quickly. The heaviness lasted two days and eventually tapered off, with the bleeding lasting a total of 7 days (which is how long my normal periods last). I initially believed the bleeding was from my partner hitting my cervix hard during intercourse; however, I did see my GYNO and after retracing my last cycles and doing some math, she said it was most likely an early period. 

Fast forward to yesterday, April 18, I stated bleeding again and experiencing period cramps. I woke up today and it’s essentially like I have my period again. I guess my question is, can this happen? I was expecting my period around this time if I hadn’t taken plan b, but I’m also wondering how much blood could possibly come out of me now. Will my cycle go back to normal next month?

Not using any substance in my life, quit smoking 8 years ago, not drinker. no known allergic reaction to any drug. doesn't have any prescription drug when the first symptom occurred. drinking tea almost every day (about 3-4 years) and sometimes black coffee without sugar before first symptom. live in Indonesia.

Medical history: hernia surgery 2001 on my right.

Primary complaint: back in November the first symptoms in night about 1AM i get suddenly drop and my heart like restarting from slow to fast like literally fast i can hear my own heart until like every sound is gone.. and then after that 5-10 minutes back to drop again, my heart pulse feels like drop, my  hand and feet cold, my body turns pale. about 15 minutes i get fast heart beat again, this happening around 3 hours feels like roller coaster. the symptom is gone after 3 days like that. and suddenly back again so i decide to go the first doctor called as Doctor A.

Doctor A prescribe me Pantopump 40 (2 times a day), Tilidon 10mg (3x/day), Farmacrol 200ml (3x/day) and the last drug is unknown, he said this is to slow my heart beat. (3x/day i stop taking this medicine after my heart feels like too slow)

Doctor B prescribe me Pariet 20mg (2 times a day), Braxidin (doctor said if my abdomen pain is unbearable, i'm not taking this drug because the pain is not much), Fermom (for my low hemo), Urdaflak 250mg (for my pancreas after USG result showing a bit thicker doctor said)

Both doctor said it was just my stress, too many thinking in night time, and my stomach is blown because too many coffee, tea, snacking on night and instant noodles.

This is my first ECG result: [https://ibb.co/cCTycjY](https://ibb.co/cCTycjY)  , and this is the second time ECG: [https://ibb.co/zr6YfhG](https://ibb.co/zr6YfhG) Both (different doctor) said it was fine, my problems is not on my heart. or should i concern with this ECG result since i got once feel like heart attack: sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain like stabbed by needle in left chest near my areola, the pain is about half minute my face is pale, i drink antacid because i think is my GERD symptom 

My Lab test result :[https://ibb.co/4dYrYwC](https://ibb.co/4dYrYwC) , all good but my hemoglobin a bit low. 

And pantopump making me back pain and a bit hurt around right lumbar region. i stop it again.

Pariet doesn't give me too much pain in my back.

and lately i feel my stomach have a bit bulge every night and a bit pain whenever i slight touch it. Only second doctor take USG to check my liver, pancreas, gaster, limfa, prostate, kidney, gall blader. USG result: Thicker on Gall blader (cholecystitis chronic), thicker on Gaster (gastritis). 

Until today my heart always pumping faster whenever i pee especially in midnight wake up, and feels like my stomach pulled down and sometimes my left chest like burn a bit every second when pee. and whenever i wake up (stand) there is a bulge on my stomach, and pain when i touch it, but it will gone if i go to sleep. And i can't do much activity if i lifting a bit weight sometimes my breath feels like shorter and sweating. 

Should i concern for anything that both doctor miss diagnosis or they are right? is my ECG result is okay? Do i have heart condition or hernia hiatus? Do i need to make another internist doctor appointment or do i need to go different specialist doctor like heart doctor? And what kind of imaging that i need?

I am female 30. 

Until two months ago, I had a neutral body odor. Even when I was sweating I didn’t have a much noticeable or disagreeable smell. At most I smelled like newly cut grass or weed. Neither unpleasant. 


Two months ago when i I had been bingeing drinking a rather cheap alcohol, Carlsberg, 3,5%. One morning I had a hangover, and decided the chips I had at home should suffice to give me the fat and salt I was craving. The chips were onion flavor. 

Ever since that day, I smell like onion, whenever I sweat, whenever I do anything that requires some effort, whenever I shower, and clean my armpits i immediately will smell like an onion. 

It’s gotten to the point others can smell it too and have asked has someone left out an onion. It’s embarrassing. 

I have never had to use any deodorant, never had to actually make an effort to mask my natural smell. 

What could have cause this sudden change? I have since gone sober and eating chips I was never my thing anyway. 

I suspect it might be something yeast? I’m at lost, 

I have booked a doctors appointment. But till then I ask for your advice and thoughts.

614,AskDocs,"Hello docs! 

I've  been working with an ""integrative nutritionist"", and I'm looking for some different perspectives (or agreement also welcome) on what she has told me  so far. I know that functional/integrative medicine is generally dismissed by the  scientific medical community, but I'm wondering if there is ANY merit at all  (e.g., even speculative) to what she is getting on about. Looking for not just completely dismissive comments, though- if you do want to dismiss completely, please help me to understand why or point me to something I can read to understand why(for my sake!).

Some  background: I've had depression/anxiety issues since I was a teenager  (now in my late 30s). Lifestyle changes help, but minimally. Psychiatric Meds (mainly  SSRIs, and viibryd in particular) DO in fact help me quite a bit, but they cause some nasty side effects  (mainly GI-related, e.g., daily diarhea) that can be difficult to manage and concern me about my overall health in the long-term. So I decided to try working with this functional  nutritionist as an experiment. I have NO scientific  background, so I have no way to evaluate what she's saying. This puts me in a vulnerable position, of course. I'm a bit a the mercy of this nutritionist since she is the one with a masters in dietetics . I've taken  the position that this is just an experimental treatment, and as long as  it doesn't cause harm to me than there's no real loss (besides $$) if it's  pointless. I will back out if it turns out to not give me noticeable benefits.

On to what she's told me:

We did a ""GI-map"" stool test (me pooping into a carton and sending it off to lab) and the results show a high  levels of pseudomonas overgrowth. She says that this is a big issue. Here is a picture of the relevant part of the test: [https://imgur.com/clIMaH6](https://imgur.com/clIMaH6) . She sees this bacterial overgrowth  as potentially the cause of some my mood struggles, and says that she has seen many  others improve vastly after eliminating this. We are  attempting to eradicate the pseudomonas through an elimination diet and some supplements (which I can list, if anyone wants to know). She has me both gluten-free and dairy-free for reasons  that I don't quite understand , but that may be related to the high  secretory IGA and anti-gliadin IGA result (I have no idea what that is...) shown in the image (link, again, here: [https://imgur.com/clIMaH6](https://imgur.com/clIMaH6))  I am a month into this treatment and I see no  benefits as of yet... I have never had anything like allergic reactions to gluten or dairy, but I do experience some bloating, I suppose, after eating them (nothing painful though). 

I have a medical doc in the family who says that the presence of pseudomonas in the gut would be expected in just about anybody and probably isn't much concern.

Any comments or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Could that lead to problems? Does the doctor prescribing the blood pressure medication need to know about the adderal, because one of it's side effects can be higher blood pressure?

My feet started turning purple when I was in my late teens. Then, they started getting broken capillaries on the surface at random. The toes are always the worst but it goes up to my mid-calf now. It feels like blood pooling in my feet, and if I raise my legs they turn a regular color until I stand up again.

The effect is immediate, within a few seconds of standing or sitting.

It doesn't hurt but it feels swollen. My feet are also very cold all the time, even in warm weather.

No doctor has been able to tell me what it is or if it's a problem- they just say 'well come back when it starts hurting'.

Maybe muscle aches. Complains of frequent sore muscles previously thought of as just “normal”.

Found this guy on my junk last night [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/ODesBx8.jpg) [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/L1djKXg.jpg). It is close up, so the location isn't too obvious, but, still, NSFW. I looked thoroughly and found nothing similar anywhere. It isn't itchy, pulsing, or painful--in fact, I only noticed it by mistake. 

Access to a relevant doctor isn't the easiest here, but I'll be organizing an appointment with someone more specialized with these things.

About a month back, mail was damaged from impact. Caused blood blister to form under nail.

I left alone until nail started to “fall off” where I then cut back the dead area about 2 weeks ago. Cleaned and dressed the area several times for about a week until area looked safe enough to leave open. 

No pain and new nail development looked to be forming, but after a shower, noticed large amount of puss discharging from the wound area. Wiped and cleaned to find a hole developed on my toe.

Mind you, I never work out, never do bicep training or anything, so im worried I overdid it because its been 2 days now and it's still really sore, actually its more sore today

After the workout I remember my arms not bending straight when I rested them, theyre still like that a lil less but it hurts way more and hurts a good bit to straighten them out or move them at all

The pain is only in one concentrated spot in each bicep, so it isnt like the whole bicep, and it hurts alot, way more than I feel like it should, its not excruuuciating pain but it hurts alot if that makes any sense

Ive been sore before i guess, im no gym rat or anything but I used to do this ""insanity intense cardio"" program with my mom back then, i remember being pretty sore but it wasnt sharp pains in a concentrated spot like this

I just feel weaker today overall too, parts of my forearms ache sometimes which is odd, and ive had slight pains in my shoulder and calves, but im not sure if any of that's related

641,AskDocs,"5 days ago I was in a motor vehicle accident. The other driver was the only contributor to the accident. When I hit their vehicle my left leg hit a lever under my dash (I think it may have been the parking brake release, but I’m not sure) and it caused a laceration about 2.5” to 3” long. I had to be transported to the hospital and get stitches. Two and a half weeks prior I had a foam sclerotherapy procedure in the exact same spot where I received the laceration. I’m concerned that it may have injured my leg further-I’ve had A LOT of complications with my lower left leg since a horrible bout of cellulitis 3 years ago. My leg was doing well before the accident, but now it is swelling again and I haven’t been able to reduce the swelling at all in the last two days. I’m just looking for some advice from anyone who has experienced something similar or has knowledge of receiving an injury to the leg after a vein procedure.

648,AskDocs,"Hi everyone,

34 yr old male, Caucasian, 5ft5 155lbs. Non smoker and non drinker

November 2022 I started experiencing some occasional blurry vision on the periphery of my left eye. Followed up with Opthamologist, Neuro ophthalmologist, and Neurologist at the time. They found that my optic nerve was inflamed. CT scans of orbit and brain were clean (except for a sinus infection), blood tests were clean. Lumbar puncture presented a pressure of 26, which i was told is borderline high. They put me on diamox for a month and a half for increased intercranial pressure. After I couldn't tolerate the pills, they took me off of it and decided that there might something else going on but they weren't worried. So I went about my life with just  the one annoying eye issue and headaches. 

Fast forward to last month, still the only symptom I was experiencing was the blurry eye issue in the periphery and some headaches. I went for an MRI, and to my shock they saw something on the left side of my brain. A single lesion that according to the neuroradiologist (I had two done) looked more like inflammation than a tumor (they used words like tumefactive, demylienating and balos like). Now the lesion is on the left side of my brain, and so is my eye issue, so doesn't look like one thing is causing the other. Since then my stress levels have been super high and I've been having other ""symptoms"" like more frequent headaches, some muffleness in my left ear and numbness in my left leg (the numbess is still there and has been there almost a week now). I have no weakness though in my legs. Weirdly, all my symptoms are on the left side, again despite the lesion also being on this side. They've found nothing on the right side of my head to explain whats going on in the left. Since then I have had multiple tests to figure out what's going on. Chest CT was clean. PET scan was clean. MRI of spine was clean. Blood tests so far are clean (although they are still waiting for some more results for some of the rarer things). Next step is another lumbar to do different tests, and another MRI in 1.5 months to see if anything new happens. 

My neurologist says she doesn't know yet what this could be. Their original thought of sarcoidosis looks very unlikely now, and tumor also seems so. To me it looks like all roads are leading to MS, and more specifically PPMS. The slow gradual progression, and only one lesion is what's leading me to this. Plus, as a male I know I'm more at risk. I'm absolutely terrified right now as I don't know how to live with this uncertainty.  I'm trying to find some hope to keep me going. Are there other better possibilities here that this could be? Is there anything else I should be doing now?

I recently got insurance so I was finally able to go to see my doctor about my back pain and she sent me for an X-ray. After I got my results, basically she just said there was disc degeneration and that she would have an orthopedic call me. I was able to see my result report through a patient portal, but not the X-ray. The report mentioned a few other things which I’ve tried to Google but would like to understand better for the time being since it’s been a while and I still haven’t heard from the ortho. 

For the second report attached, I went to the emergency room for some severe pain that was making me unable to stand up and vomit. They did a CT, and told me my intestines were inflamed. They gave me some pain meds and sent me home. I had a doctors appointment scheduled the next day for blood work prior to the ER visit. After the visit, the called me and said my CT revealed a mass on my right adrenal gland and she wanted to schedule an MRI. 

When I checked the results on the patient portal, I noticed a few other things that had not been mentioned to me and I would like a better understanding of.

I’ve been bloated for a while (I was diagnosed with gastritis before the bloating got bad) and having unprotected sex so I decided to take a pregnancy test in case it was a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy but it came back negative.

The bleeding has gradually slowed down a little and turned darker like it would on a period and the cramps aren’t as bad now, however I feel so much worse now - practically no appetite, aches and muscle spasms in my hands, arms, legs and back, constant slight temperature, feeling weak and tired… I think I’m now very dehydrated from suddenly losing so much blood and having diarrhoea but input is appreciated ◡̈

661,AskDocs,"34f. I grew up without experiencing any allergies, which I now understand was pretty lucky. Over the last few years, though, I’ve been hit pretty hard by what I think is allergies - every 2 weeks or so, I experience some kind of flare up with insane sinus issues and pressure (sneezing nonstop, congestion, teeth pain, ears blocked, sinus headaches, one of my eyes sometimes swells up pretty good, post nasal drip, sore/raspy voice, etc.). The other day I got some kind of double vision, which per Google is maybe was related? Often, I’m like a cartoon sick person with the sneezing, like 5x in a row every 10 mins, and red nose from all the tissues.

It lasts for 1-2 days and then comes back again in a couple weeks. And I don’t seem to be getting much relief with an OTC 24 hour allergy medicine. Sometimes Sudafed is helpful for the congestion and sinus pain, not the sneezing though. Not sure if this is relevant, but I also have a slight deviated septum, so I’ve always had a little trouble breathing out of one nostril, particularly when congested, but I’ve just lived with it.

I take carvedilol 12.5 mg 2x/day for high blood pressure

Because of an issue with my heath plan I went a few weeks without pills.

Monday I had BP reading of 191/131 (without medication I usually am somewhere in the 150/110 range) and was able to restart my medication. Yesterday it was 179/110. I used an Omron 5 series to take it.

But yesterday I noticed blurring in my vision, specifically my right eye. It is like those censor spots used in videos. If I close the right eyes my vision is fine, But if I keep that one open what ever I try to focus on goes blurry. Anything outside that area I see fine until I try to focus on it. The blurring is enough that I cannot read anything with that eye.

As a test I stood 20 feet away from a paining. I could see it clearly at all times with my left eye. Had to be within 6 inches to see it with my right.

Ever since I can remember, even as a kid, I've gotten very sick very easily. However recently it's gotten worse. This February I dealt with a sinus infection and bronchitis that was so severe I had to get antibiotics, and moving made me feel so much worse I was practically bedridden for a week. 

I've never been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, but it seems like I get sick at least once every two weeks. The most common symptoms are migraines, stomach pains, extreme fatigue and dizzyness.

672,AskDocs,"25F, currently recovering from my first laparoscopic surgery and hydrodistention cystoscopy last week. Prior to surgery, I had multiple pelvic exams and ultrasounds, as well as a CT and MRI, all normal aside from a large, complex cyst rupturing last year. As I was coming off anesthesia, I remember my OBGYN (surgeon) saying I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and had found no evidence of endometriosis, but I won't have any more info until a follow-up in a week and a half.

I appreciate that he provided surgical photos, though aside from my visibly enflamed bladder (looks exactly like pictures of Hunner's ulcers) I am not qualified to interpret them. I understand that I do have IC and want to trust my doctor's findings and be relieved and ready to treat it, but I'm really struggling with this.

 I've never once experienced urgency/frequency or woken up needing to go. The only checked box on the symptom list is pelvic pain, but my eventual surgeon pushed for a potassium sensitivity test and cystoscopy. What drove me to seek help is a long history of debilitating menstrual pain and PMDD symptoms, heavy/abnormal bleeding, painful sex, GI issues, migraine, and ~10 mos of cyclical inflammation like a golf ball near my hip that causes pain/pressure from my ribs down, a tugging feeling, and numbness in that leg. The OBGYN who advised the lap said I was a classic case for endometriosis and wanted to get me help ASAP, which due to availability meant having another doctor see me and do the surgery.

Would it be appropriate to ask my surgeon about a few black and red spots and a white patch (he didn't take any biopsies) I saw in the photos? Would taking the photos to get a second opinion down the line be possible? Are there other conditions that fit my symptoms, or is it possible I do have endo and it's at a very early stage? It's like I got an answer to a question I wasn't asking - though I'm extremely grateful for the advance warning of IC - and no resolution for the one I had. My access to healthcare is about to change, which was why it was so important to me to do this now. I'm feeling a little lost right now, and I'm crushed nothing was able to be done for my pain.

This has been plaguing me my entire life.  Got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis about 7 years ago, have had weight loss surgery (and lost weight, 105lbs so far and am still losing but slowly). Have tried managing through diet (keto and low carb), taking L glutamine, metformin nothing helps.  Am full but never satisfied with food. No thyroid issues but I do take extra iodine as I had one previously. Exercise about twice a week in the gym but also moderately active, lots of walking and use weights.

I am just asking if there are any possible unexplored reasons for this.  I was diabetic but my sugars have returned to normal since weight loss. My rheumatologist told me that whereas I could be suffering from insulin resistance related to the rheumatoid arthritis because my numbers are good it shouldn't be the reason I'm struggling.  My GP and rheumatologist both accept it's an issue, it's deeper than just my diet and it's not all in my head.  Would just like to hear from anyone who may have a helpful suggestion as to what to try next or if they did something that helped them.

I noticed my jugular vein pulse is very visible last year and I kind of forgot about it until I noticed it again a week ago. I am skinny and I am usually able to see my pulse in my neck, but I could barely fall asleep last night because my jugular, I think, was fluttering and it made me anxious. I am pretty sure it isn't a muscle twitch because it follows my heartbeat but it flutters twice per every heartbeat. It's mostly visible when I lay down, in the supraclavicular fossa and when I breathe in it is more visible and looks more exaggerated. It is more visible on the right side of my neck and there is a thin blue vein that I can see but nothing looks out of the ordinary, there is no swelling. I had an echo done last year and everything seemed normal, my BP is usually low, my heart races sometimes, every ecg that i had was normal too.

Complaint - 2 weeks ago I was putting on lotion on my neck ( a different way than I am use to) and felt a small lump where the chin meets your neck. It is very small like the point of a ball point pen and is located on what seems to be a tendon or muscle. It is located in the middle section of the neck - the muscle the lump is on is thin but firm. I have been keeping a close eye on it. It does not hurt. You cannot feel it unless my head is tilted back and you are looking for it.  I have recently over the last 10 months lost 80 pounds ( intentionally)  and figured maybe it has just been there and I have just noticed ( I have lost a lot of weight in my face and neck).

Hello, 
I’ve (3M) been suffering from bilateral chronic CSCR for 8 years. I’ve always used only one eye since I was a kid.
I’ve been treated with PDT on the right eye (the good one) 3 years ago that left me a scar in my vision and with that occurrence also some permanent metamorphopsia. 
I lived with it fine until the last month on that eye I noticed that the distortion was heavier. I immediately check with my eye doctor and no new occurrence, the retina was in its place and ever in order. What can cause this sudden worsening of my sight? Is the PDT scar? Is a retina tear?

&amp;#x200B;

last week, I picked up the cornet again (basically trumpet). Ive always had weak hands/upper body strength so presumed the ache, tingling and numbness a couple of days later was probably a result of suddenly putting some unused muscles to work. My ring and pinky on both hands have been pretty consistently numb for 12 days now. The numbness is maybe slightly worse in the pinkies and loss of sensation is intermittent. I can’t quite figure out what is making it worse. Clasped hands (threading fingers together), driving, sleeping with my hands under the pillow could be culprits but it’s really hard to pinpoint what about those positions is the issue. I tried wrist supports with a splint for two days and it felt like it made it worse but it’s been hard to tell.

I experienced over a week of pins and needles when driving about a year ago before it went away.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info which may not be of any use;

I was diagnosed with inflammatory psoriatic arthritis, but this may be thrown out as my recent hair loss, lack of arthritis markers showing up in bloods and inconsistent response to methotrexate. My left knee is basically always swollen. My stool has been abnormally strong smelling with partly digested food since childhood. My GP is basically stumped and the other told me I should eat more sweetcorn.

In terms of numbness and tingling, this is probably normal but I CANNOT sit on floors for long as my legs go dead/I get pins and needles.

So this is something that has happened to me throughout my life but didn’t realize was weird until recently. Sometimes, I can feel one of my ribs pop. It’s usually when I’m coughing, laughing, or tbh, when I’m straining to uh…have a bowel movement (I have chronic constipation, in the sense that I go pretty regularly but strain a good deal of the time). But I’ve never had any issues with the popping rib, no associated pain or spinal pain or anything. Just this popping sensation in my rib maybe once every two or three months. I don’t think my ribs stick out noticeably afterwards either. I believe it’s usually if not always the same rib, the lowest one on my right side.

Hello docs,

I had a MRI Arthogram done on my shoulder, because I'm having severe front shoulder pain right where my pec meets the humerus under the collarbone, its been there for 2 years now, my doctor says it will take 2 weeks before I get my report, so I thought maybe one of you docs could take a look and see if there is something out of the ordinary. Would appreciate it a lot. I did physiotherapy for like 1 year now and nothing is helping.. here is the imgur link.

Hi,

in 2017, I had what I suspect was glandular fever or Mono. I presented with fatigue, weakness and swollen throat to the point I was struggling to breathe. No fever.

Since then I have never felt the same. I've had different symptoms over the years but there have been core ones that have remained.

* Heavy fatigue
* Muscle Pain
* Unrefreshing sleep
* General Malaise
* Anxiety (due to dealing with symptoms while trying to live normally)

I've had most of the common issues ruled out. Heart checked, Xrays done, other bloods etc. 

4w times now since 2017, the only levels detected are from IgM. I even had a CMV IgM done incase of false positive or cross contamination where levels not detected.

I suppose I'm worried this could be a rare chronic EBV infection which can lead to complications such as death, and its been 6 years.

Has anyone seen this before? What could possibly be the cause?  


[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15113035/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15113035/)

&amp;#x200B;

This study from 2004 says ""IgM Serum antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus are uniquely present in a subset of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome""

713,AskDocs,"Hello, 
So I’ve had an irritated throat for at least 6 months. It doesn’t hurt but the back of my throat is constantly reddened and veiny(cobblestone throat). Also I always seem to have a lot of mucus in my throat. So to add to all this, about a year ago, I felt a lump on the right side of my upper front neck. I went to the doctor about it. Got a CT of my throat, and also am I grasping of the lump area. The only thing they showed was an enlarged lymph node but the doctors didn’t think it was cancerous. Every time I’ve gone in to get it checked. It hasn’t grown as far as I and the doctors can tell. It’s not painful and it is moveable. Blood work always comes up normal. But over this last year I’ve had an on and of irritation of my throat and it’s been becoming more precipitant over the last 6 months. When I went to the doctors the irritation, he said to take flonase and Zyrtec every day for two months and to reach out to him if the irritation continued. Two months later it still continuous. I’ve also noticed some white patches on the very back bilateral sides of my tongue. Looks like thrush. When examining my mouth further, I noticed some lumps or bumps on the very back of my tongue. Not sure if that’s what is on the very back of a tongue or not but they seemed kinda big to me. They didn’t look red or swollen. Tonsils are a little swollen, the right one more so. I reached out to my doctor today about it but it was after hours so I’ll have to wait and see what he wants to do tomorrow. Ever since finding the lump, I’ve been scared of having cancer, my doctors has assured me it’s not cancer. But with this persistent irritated throat, it’s making me worry. I don’t have any allergies, I’ve never had a throat irritation this long in my life. I’m a 28M. Healthy and fit. Haven’t been losing weight. Actually gaining weight. I have a partner and we are sexually active. I have been vaccinated for HPV.

728,AskDocs,"Hey, 22f. 

So, about two months ago I was stretching and I felt a really bad pain in my abdomen. I ended up going to the ER, and they did an ultrasound. I was told I have a 2.4cm complex cyst, and they told me to see an obgyn.

I went to see the obgyn, and they basically said that it would go away and they scheduled me for an ultrasound (which I had to reschedule because I couldn’t afford it- I’m in the US with no health insurance, currently).  I feel like they didn’t take it seriously, because when they mentioned they would consider removing the cyst surgically, that would be their last option, because it could always come back. I asked them why not just remove the ovary, but they said that the hot flashes and night sweats would be worse than the pain. Except, I feel that isn’t true, especially since I’ve been experiencing hot flashes and night sweats throughout this.

The pain hasn’t gone away, and it’s only gotten worse. I’m always so tired and feel like I can’t get any sleep because the pain is so bad. I’ve been throwing up and feeling nauseous all the time, too. I’ve also lost a bit of weight, too. I guess I just haven’t had an appetite, due to the pain. I lost just about ten pounds in the two week span from going to the ER to seeing the obgyn. I’ve also had my period twice, since it’s been two months, but it’s been heavier than usual and my first period lasted almost two weeks. They’re typically kind of irregular but not like this.

I also feel like the cyst has gotten bigger, but maybe I’m just being paranoid. I’m now 120 pounds and my stomach is kinda flat, but my lower abdomen pokes out a little. I suppose I could be imagining it, but I’m not sure. 

They have me down for the ultrasound and a consultation appointment right after that, on the same day, a couple of weeks from now. Is there anything I can do? Should I be concerned or worried?

I’ve been out of work for two months because I can’t be on my feet for long, and it’s painful. My partner has been supporting us both financially because I can’t. I didn’t expect to be like this for this long.

For a very long time I have been trying to solve the problem of a bloated stomach. As I remember myself starting from my 20s it was always like this. And l am desperately sick of it. 

I have a bloated stomach when I eat and when I don't eat. When I even just drink water. In the morning, even though I'm hungry, I still have a bloated stomach. It brings a lot of discomfort and a drop in self-esteem. 

I lead a more or less active life. I am a little bit thin myself. I do not eat meat. I eat an unbalanced vegetarian diet. I used to eat a lot of white bread. Do not drink sweet sodas at all. 

Recently, when I had an ultrasound, the nurse noticed a lot of gas. 

When I starve, the discomfort decreases the next day. 

I watched Dr. Berg's video on youtube. After that I began to think that the problem is in the gallbladder and pancreas. I drink apple cider vinegar every day before meals. Started taking probiotics (lineks forte) yesterday. The situation has not improved much. 

After using a toilet, the feeling of incomplete emptying is present. The stool itself was at level 6 on the Bristol scale for a long time. Lately it has been more like level 5.  Doesn't float. Sinks right away.

37M 5”6. 

Can’t get info anywhere pls help!

Left it untreated for like 3 months as it grew worse.

now Ive been taking it for 2months and its working, but its only like half healed/down. So at this rate it would take another 2 months. So 4months total probably. (Specifically Amoxicillin Clav 875/125 &amp; Bactiver Sulfamethoxazole, Trimetoprima 800-160.. both Types 2 pills each a day)

My Doc just says “yeah sometimes it takes many months, keep taking them don’t worry” but theres a lot of solid evidence of how bad long-term antibiotic usage is. But it is indeed slowly working.. and I hear how stopping early can make it worse down the road, but 2 months doesn’t seem “early”.

So can I stop for a month and start back up and hopefully negate some of the long term effects? 

Extra info: Also one doc said it would need surgery but the other did a culture test on it and said its the type that can be cured by antibiotics alone. But now im thinking surgery mite be a good idea just to speed up the process. I don’t know.

The other thing is the 2nd doc said sometimes theres scar tissue left behind  so it mite actually be fully healed we don’t know, although theres still red around it a bit so I don’t think so, and it seems to shrink a little each day or 2.

Anyway its all quite complicated but its hard to find good info online.

Here is the list of medication I am taking:   
1. Minoxidil (air pump solution for scalp)  
2. Vitamin B12 and some other multivitamins in a single tablet  
3. Biotin tablet

5. Cetirizine Gel (10mg) along with a serum consisting of only plant based constituents (to be applied on scalp)   


I shaved my head initially so that it is easy to do all the procedures, but I cant keep my head shaved so right now I have longer hair.   


I am doing everything religiously and only eat homemade nutritious food and have stopped eating junk food as well(sometimes I eat, when I go on dates I do eat Junk food). My only bad habit is that I sleep really late and eat at odd hours.   


My problem is that, even after all of this effort I see new hair only on one side of my head, and th other side of head I feel is still losing much hair and no new growth I am able to observe. Please note that the losing hair part might just be in my head given the progress on the other side of head but I am pretty sure that I don't see new hair on that side.   


Can docs on this subreddit give any input upon what I can do about this problem of mine and how to grow back my hair? I will obviously consult your opinions with my doctor as well.

During this period I get adrenaline rushes, had arrythmia from being woken up from sleep with adrenaline rush, had to spend night in ICU. Doctors don’t find anything. I do personally EBV igm and Igg only igg positive with high titter and pcr negative in blood.

Heart Ultrasound normal
ENMG normal
Blood many times CBC normal
ESR and CRB always normal
EBV igg 54 S/CO and slowly falling now 50s/co
EBV Pcr negative
Full Ena + Anca panel all negative.
Had positive Ana 1:80 ac25 mitotic spindle fibers in USA.
Negative Ana in Lithuania.


Symptoms diaily and they are intermittment:

Intermittment weakness in limbs
Headaches
Burning sensation in legs
Neurological irritation in hands and legs
Intermittment Tinnitus
Insomnia
Heart Palpatations
Weird rashes of unknown nature
Extreme fatigue (never felt that kind of fatigue ever)

Officialy doctors diagnosed me with Mono but the infectologist said it is not possible that I have active infection since pcr negative in blood. And so I waited and it is not getting better. I am a bit lost and in need of help.

Like if I rub my fingers together I can't hear it the same as my other ear, and I don't know if that's normal or if it's all in my head.

I'm afraid to go to the doctor because then, what if it's just my anxiety worsening my perception or at worse, causing the whole thing? I know I've gone to the doctor before five years ago over a panic attack, I thought I was having a heart attack. Another time I was completely convinced I had a thyroid issue. Then last year I went and it was also anxiety related, where the ear pain turned out to be bruxism or at worse more anxiety. This whole situation is just terrible because I cannot trust myself and so what will happen when I truly do have a problem and I ignore it?

So I’ll cut to the chase, I’m looking for any possible causes or remedies to explain the pain that I’ve had on my left abdomen below my ribs. 

About 3 years ago I got my gallbladder removed and since then, my left side directly across from where my gallbladder used to be is killing me.

The pain is always at about a 2 or 3 but from what I’ve noticed anything that would cause a gallbladder to have pain ( red meat, oil, caffeine) seem to also cause more pain to my left side. 

If I over consume meat or oil, the pain can get so bad that for 3-5 days ( sometimes more ) I can’t bring myself to have anything other than liquids and maybe a small amount of chicken noodle soup. I’ll also be almost completely bedridden during that time because the pain is so severe.

Don’t get me wrong,  I’ve tried cutting back on these things but it seems that some days my tolerance for them is higher than other days so I haven’t been able to pinpoint the exact amount I can have before my side decides it’s pain time. ( eg. one day it might freak out because I have a hotdog another day it has decided that small tablespoon of oil I used to cook chicken was too much ) 

Eventually I tried taking painkillers for it. But unfortunately after the painkillers wore off, I was in so much more pain than what I started with it just became easier to deal with the constant pain. 

Over the year the pain has seemed to start to radiate to the lower left quadrant right above my hip.

 I’ve also noticed a large soft lump there that seems so wrap around to my back and stings when pressed on.

I’ve been to the doctors in my town over this but they say that it’s a pulled muscle and the only thing that seems to come back wrong from the CT, x-ray and blood tests ( cbc, lipase, celiac, thyroid ) is that my lipase is on the lower end but not anything crazy enough to worry about. When I mentioned the sudden lump on my side, they said it was just fat and I was over thinking it. 

When I tried to get them to look at my liver  due to my history (I had issues during my pregnancy with my liver and my grandmother died due to her liver ) but since I don’t drink the doctors told me that they felt it wouldn’t be worth the time as every other test came back in the normal range and I had no risk factors. 

I’m kind of losing hope I’ll ever actually know what it is but if someone has a theory I’m open to hearing it. 

Ultimately I’m just hoping someone here can at least give me ideas to try to ease the pain.",t2_4ecjgbh9n,0,Left abdominal pain under ribs.

I also noticed I have this swollen vein or lump like spot on the inside of my eyebrow (the part in line and above the inner corner of my eye) it feels tender to touch (bruise like).

I'm actually not sure if this is related with my PCOS because it isn't like cysts that grows and go away naturally. 

The ""beans"" I'm referring to are hard, can't be popped, and has been here for years already. They are multiplying in my neck tho.

766,AskDocs,"Hello, everyone. I am 22\[M\], 5'1, 110 lbs, Asian, and my primary complaint is should I be worried about contracting HIV through my encounter that I described below and if my current yeast infection has anything to do with it?

So, to give you some background information, I'll start off with that I do have the tendency to over react and escalate situations when they perhaps don't need to be escalated. I often let my anxiety overwhelm me and influence my decisions. I'm sorry in advance if my thought process was a little silly, logically, I know I might have overreacted

About three weeks ago, I wanted to hook-up with someone. I don't hook-up very often as in the past it has always freaked me out. Someone I used to hook-up with on Grindr initiated and asked if I wanted to do anything. I obliged but I let him know that I'm currently waiting to try and get PReP at my next healthcare appointment and would not be comfortable doing oral or anal sex with him until I can get access to it. He agreed and we participated in kissing, mutual masturbation, but where he caught me off guard was when he tried to rub my anus. After realizing, I pushed his fingers away and let him know that I wasn't comfortable with that. He said okay and we proceeded and that was that, I had a decent time. 

But, as my brain does every time I have ever had any sexual contact with someone, it overthought. What if his fingers had precum on them and it went through my anus? What if he was HIV+ (I asked these questions prior, he said he was HIV negative, but got tested three months ago and had on and off again hook-ups with or without condoms in the past three months so I told him, definitely no oral or anal sex then). So, consumed in my anxiety and regret I went to my local urgent care and talked to someone about what just happened. They recommended that I didn't need PEP per se because my exposure was extremely limited, but they prescribed it to me anyway (Truvada once daily and Isentress 400mg twice daily). I started PEP within 20 hours and I have been taking it for the past three weeks. For the past three weeks, I have been freaking out and going into the cyclical mindset of: did I really get HIV from that encounter? I don't have it? I do have it. Is the medication even working? Did I even need the medication?

Fast forward to this morning. I woke up and was getting ready to brush my teeth when I noticed this weird sticky white/clear gooey substance on my lower lip and lower lip only. I peeled it off and it had like, the consistency of AquaPhor (which, I haven't been using in a while). I asked my sister what it was and she said she thinks it's a yeast infection and prescribed me with fluconazole. I contacted a nurse if there were going to be drug interactions and if it was safe with my PEP and she said there were no drug interactions so it was safe to take. (If this helps, the nurse asked me if I felt any pain, if there was any canker sores, if there was anything on my tongue, the answers to all those questions are no)

But, then I went into a rabbit hole of research. And, of course, I saw that a yeast infection can come from HIV and now I'm spiraling down a really deep hole of anxiety. So, I guess what I'm asking is, is it likely that I contracted HIV from my initial encounter and did I need PEP in the first place? Additionally, is my yeast infection just an unfortunate coincidence that likely comes from something unrelated and is not a sign of acute HIV? Oh, PS, the gooey substance came back on my lower lip in the evening

TL;DR: I had a brief hook-up with someone with an unknown HIV status that didn't involve anal or oral but involved a brief massage to my anus. I took PEP as soon as I could within 20 hours but three weeks later, I think I have a yeast infection (white gooey stuff that I personally thought was just an oral mucosa peeling). Should I start panicking?

That is my story and my thoughts. Thank you so much for reading through my thoughts and please let me know what you think",t2_4nneod4iw,0,Yeast Infection + HIV Concern.

777,AskDocs,"Female, 26 years old, having the worst week. Starting 8 days ago I had to go home from work due to a stomach ache and overwhelming nausea. That night I had been laying on my couch watching tv and pooped my pants for the first time in my life. That started the night of liquid watery diarrhea about every 1-2 hours for roughly 10 hours. Went to urgent care the next day because I was still overwhelmingly nauseous and had bad upper and mid- abdominal cramping. Was told it was likely viral gastroenteritis and given Zofran, a muscle relaxer, and told to pick up an anti-diarrheal OTC but be careful not to use that too often to avoid constipation. 
It has been 7 days now since that urgent care visit and I have been struggling to eat as eating causes abdominal cramping, bloating, and nausea. Vomited once two days ago but not much came up since I had been eating so little. I have lost 6 lbs since this all started. My fiancé is not having these symptoms.

Last night I went out for dinner with family and ate a small amount of chicken and corn which settled fine and I took my muscle relaxer before eating and before bed later on in the night. Then around 11pm I woke up with significant upper abdominal cramping that I had to sit and breathe through that passed in about 10-15 minutes. Went back to bed. Woke up again at 1am and found that I had pooped myself, the bed, and on my fiancé sleeping next to me. I am HORRIFIED. The stool consists primarily of brown-orange water. I hopped in the shower and here I am on Reddit. 

No new medications or changes in eating or lifestyle. I often feel dehydrated and like my mouth is very dry even though I am drinking lots of water and pedialyte. I do have a follow up with my primary care doctor next week. Should I be tested for anything specific? I work as a veterinary nurse and come in contact with lots of intestinal parasites through my patients but to my knowledge the only one that is a concern for people is Giardia but that’s pretty rare for humans to get from animals. Should I ask for testing for parasites? Or is this normal for viral gastroenteritis? Do I need to bump up my doctor’s visit? Help!

TLDR; 8 days of liquid diarrhea, very nauseous, vomited only once, moderate to sometimes severe abdominal cramping, have pooped myself twice. Dehydrated.

So recently I’ve developed around 5 or 6 scabs on my arms. I’m not sure where they came from but I saw a pretty large scab under my arm that most of been there for a while because I didn’t even notice it. I’m hoping none of the scabs are infected because I feel perfectly fine the large scab went from being crusty to being the same size but feels like the crust is gone but you can still see the dark spot. I’m not sure if it’s cause of some kind of rash because there are also like 4 small red pimple ish things on my arms that have a little bit of yellow fluid in it but I’m not sure what it is because it’s not pus because puss is thick and this is yellow but is watery like. I haven’t put bandages on my scabs but I’ve just kept washing them and keeping them moisturized every now and then but I’m not sure when they’ll go away because it’s been at least 2 or 3 weeks since I’ve noticed them and I’ve gotten 2 more scabs out of no where since then. I think they got there from some rash because they seem to be going from small red bumps and into scabs.

785,AskDocs,"I've (34M, 5'9"" 190lbs) dealt with throat discomfort my whole life and started seeing an ENT about it a few years ago. We discovered that I had an abnormally elongated styloid which protruded into my tonsil, and decided to remove it to see if it would give me some relief. I underwent an intraoral styloidectomy a year and a half ago, but because of how the scar healed, my palatopharyngeal arch and uvula were pulled downward, closer to the base of my tongue. Ever since the surgery, I'm in significant and constant discomfort. When I swallow, it's unsatisfying, and when I speak, it feels like certain sounds get ""caught"" in my throat. E.g., when I try to make a ""w"" sound, like in ""what,"" the base of my tongue touches my soft palate/uvula to make a soft ""g"" sound. I constantly feel like I have to gag, and it's hard to speak without needing to stop often so that I don't gag. 

The constant discomfort has impacted my quality of life profoundly. I don't go out much to see my friends, or even call them on the phone because of how uncomfortable it is to talk. I've become completely isolated because of this. It's hard to concentrate on anything, and relaxation is impossible. What options do I have? We've floated around the idea of a uvulvectomy, but I'm not sure if the uvula is the (only) issue, or if it's my soft palate/both. A UPPP would be a more extreme option, but is that excessive?

It’s vertical pain stretching from my lower ear all the way down to almost my shoulder. The pain subsides a bit with advil, but otherwise the pain is unbearable. It hurts just by me doing absolutely nothing, eating, talking hurts even more. There’s also a different shape in this side of my neck that I noticed today as if it’s swollen and protruding out like a long bump. What did I do? Does anyone have any idea what I did? I’ve strained my neck before but this doesn’t feel like a common strain, if anything this pain hasn’t subsided whatsoever in three whole days and it doesn’t feel like it’s just going to magically go away.

Hi I made a post on Saturday about my son running fevers all day with neck, back, arms and leg pain. I took the advice of an EMT on here since they were the first one to respond (so please no mean comments again) and took him in and they ran some blood and tested him for flu and covid. He had some inflammation but everything else was negative. Today is day 4 and he's still running fevers between 101.8-103.5 he also has fatigue, vomiting and just complaining of back and neck pain. He started developing a running nose today. 

Took him into the doctors today at the regular clinic (different physician) He wanted to do a stool sample and strep. Strep was negative. The doctor and nurse seemed really concerned, but also were not sure what could be the issue since the ER ran a bunch of tests already. He's done a total of 3 covid test. He sent in some Zofran and wants me to up his fluid intake as he thinks that's why he could be having neck and back pain. He also did happen to have petechia on his shoulders but the ones on his side doctor said was not. If there's something I can mention to his regular doctor on Friday (appointment was already existing) as I don't think he will be better by then since symptoms are worsening. I would appreciate any advice! Is there's something else they could have missed? I'm super worried.

800,AskDocs,"So a few years ago I didn’t have any health issues except that I was overweight (probably 230lbs/ish at the time, 5ft and also during incident 18F)
But one day I got a little stoned, went into the kitchen to make some food and everything was normal until halfway through making my sandwich. I got doom feeling, and then something told my brain my legs were about to stop working (I truly still don’t know how) but I got on the floor and then just like that my legs stopped working. I couldn’t move them, they were numb but I’d be able to feel deep pains if I had tried.. I was questioning what was going on in my head and I asked myself if I smelt toast because I thought I was having a stroke, I tried to speak out loud and it came out garbled and nonsense. Muscles and face felt weak.. I sat there confused on the floor for a few minutes before I got scared and dragged myself into my bedroom.. I was okay 30 minutes later. Since then every year or so I have sciatica that makes it so my legs can’t move and I’m incapacitated until I’m medicated (can be weeks and months of chronic nerve pain and numbness) I’m 22 now, it stopped the year I was pregnant and it hasn’t happened since but I’m wondering now if I should be scared the first incidence was a mini-stroke or something. It wasn’t like my sciatica. No tests have been run on me because every doctor refused and just treated me for sciatica. My last doctor suggested it was trauma related and I just strongly don’t believe that. I have a daughter now and I’d just like to know if I should get checked out for that health concern, long term livings plans and all that.

802,AskDocs,"21F, have had deviated septum and nasal valve collapse surgery when I was 16 and 17. Chronically had slight nasal congestion, but nothing unbearable. Constant awful sinus pain for about 3 months. Feels like it’s getting worse. Originally diagnosed with sinus infection but after several antibiotics, steroids, sprays, etc nothing had helped. I got a CT scan the other day (results in a Reddit post on this subreddit if the information is helpful) and my doctor said he doesn’t think it’s an intranasal infection. He’s referring me to neurology because he’s “seen facial pain from a neurologic problem” before. I’m just wondering if anyone has any idea what would be connected to sinus pain and a neurological problem? I know trigeminal neuralgia is a possibility, but I try not to jump the gun. I’ve also had on and off jaw pain, but I just assumed it was from the two cavities I have.

803,AskDocs,"Hi. I (27F) am from Perú. I've been worried about having problems with my testosterone levels. I have had problems with my ovaries since I was 17 (had a cyst mostly made by liquid drained by laparoscopic surgery). I also have always had high libido until a couple of years ago when it completely disappeared. Now I still have lubrication problems (underwear hurts to wear) and have heart palpitations almost all the time.

I was also diagnosed with depression and underwent treatment for that with antidepressants for 7 years. I don't take them any longer.

The problem is premature menopause runs in my family. My grandma stopped menstruating at 35 and my mom at 40.  I don't plan to have biological kids but I know there are some risks associated with premature menopause. It also hurts me to have no sexual life this early in my life. 

The latest blood work my physician took showed results of 0.5 pg/ml of free testosterone with a normal range of \[0.1-6.3\] pg/ml according to the laboratory of that hospital. However when I look up this same procedure elsewhere it mostly shows a higher normal range \[0.8 - 4.7 pg/ml\] (Another one said anything below 1.5pg/ml should be considered low). I also found that there are problems with assessing whether lost libido is a problem for women and that that could create a problem when thinking what normal ranges are.

Now I don't know if I should tell this to my doctor. Last time he told me I was alright and that it's probably my depression... they have been saying the same thing for more than 10 years. It worries me that they are assessing me wrongly because they think sexual problems are not problems, but the norm in females. As if they were telling me ""this is your body now, get used to it"".

What else can I do? What other examinations should I ask for to discard early menopause?",t2_6m34j5dl,0,Doubts about testosterone screening in women.

My child has been in the hospital over the last week for suspected autoimmune encephalitis. I brought him to the ER on 4/11 per instruction from his pediatrician due to visual hallucinations. He was admitted after neurology came to the ER for a consult. The hallucinations have not been improving with treatment as of yet (4 days of IV steroids &amp; 1 day of IV IG, see below for more specifics). I've been advised 90% of the labs will take a couple of weeks to get back. Is there anything else we should be considering? He's the happiest kid, he absolutely loves school and his friends and teachers and he can't wait to go home. He knows what he's seeing isn't real and I wish I could make it go away. Any insight/advice would be so appreciated. He's been a trooper throughout this process but it's not easy wondering every day what is going on. I can provide additional information if needed/requested. 

Assessment/Plan: 
Child is a 6 y.o. 5 m.o. male with PMH of hypnagogic hallucinations and asthma who presents for evaluation of 2 days of daytime hallucinations. Given acute onset of worsening visual hallucinations that started with nighttime awakenings on 4/7 and then progressed to daytime visual hallucinations on 4/10, we are concerned for autoimmune encephalitis. LTM EEG with left parasagittal and temporal spike wave epileptiform discharges, suggestive of underlying brain irritability. However, patient is very well appearing with no other classic features of autoimmune encephalitis- no encephalopathy, no weakness, no abnormal movements. Given that he is very well appearing and is not demonstrating significant decline from day to day, we will plan to first obtain CSF and brain MRI with contrast prior to starting immunosuppression. If CSF is bland, we would likely still recommend treating with immunosuppression given clinical concern and patient meeting diagnostic criteria for autoimmune encephalitis. 
 
EEG is abnormal but no definite seizures. Frequent and sleep activated left temporal and parasagittal spike and wave epileptiform discharges. Brain MRI normal. LP overall bland with 1 nucleated cell in tube 1, 2 nucleated cells in tube 2. Other labs pending but does have ANA positive at 1:320.
 
Has been on IV steroids since 4/14 with no improvement in visual hallucinations. Will plan to continue steroids for total 5-day course and discuss case with our neuroimmunology colleagues. (This plan changed after neuroimmunology consult, began tapering steroids after 4th day to begin IV IG) 

Treatment:
- s/p 4-days of high dose IV methylprednisolone (30mg/kg daily)
- prednisone taper:
 1mg/kg (max 60mg) prednisone tapering over 6 weeks (can roughly cut in half every 7 days)
Week 1: 30mg daily
Week 2: 15mg daily
Week 3: 10mg daily
Week 4: 5mg daily
Off
 
- start IVIG today for 2-days-  IVIG 2g/kg divided over 2 days. Started on 4/17 treatment was well-tolerated 

Resulted workup: 
- EEG abnormal with frequent abundant spike wave epileptiform discharges
- EEG continued to demonstrate frequent abundant left parasagittal and temporal spike wave epileptiform discharges
-EEG from 4/12
-Frequent to abundant left parasagittal spike wave epileptiform discharges that occurred both independently and in brief 1-3 Hz runs lasting &lt;10 seconds (BIRDS)
-Occasional to abundant left temporal spike wave epileptiform discharges that occurred both independently and in brief 1-1.5 Hz runs lasting &lt;10 seconds (BIRDS)
- quick brain MRI normal 
- sedated brain MRI with contrast normal, incidental finding of likely arachnoid cyst
- Reassuring CBCd, BMP/Mg/Phos, LFT's
- ESR and CRP normal 
- TSH elevated to 7.44, free T4 normal at 1.1 
- B12 and folate normal 
- RPR non-reactive 
- Rhinovirus positive 
- Ceruloplasmin normal 
- Urine tox negative 
- UA normal 
- ANA positive 1:320, speckled 
- Serum copper within normal range 
- CSF opening pressure 15 
- CSF cell count and total protein normal
- Anti-TPO antibodies negative
- HIV 1/2 negative

Child is a cheerful and pleasant 6 yo boy, from X attending Kindergarten at X. He has a hx of mild OSA, hypogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations since early on, asthma, no prior past psychiatric history, presenting for worsening hallucinations since 4/10, admitted for medical work up on etiology. Psychiatry consulted for diagnostic clarification, support and medication management.
 
4/14/23: Patient continues to be calm and cooperative, behaviorally appropriate for a 6-year-old boy.  Continues to experience visual hallucinations, yesterday night described as ""monsters,"" which patient is understandably afraid of. Most of patient's hallucinations are visual, vivid, and neutral with minimal emotional involvement. No auditory hallucinations. No clear seizure activity on EEG, other than minor blinking, clinical signs of seizure disorder not noted on physical exam. Pt age, onset, and symptoms are not typical of a primary psychotic disorder or normal development. We agree with pediatric neurology and primary team that the origin of hallucinations are organic. No emotional or behavioral dysregulation. Thus, we do not recommend scheduled psychotropic medications at this time. Pediatric neurology assess patient has underlying brain irritability from EEG findings (left parasagittal and temporal spike wave epileptiform discharges), likely secondary to encephalitis, as opposed to seizure disorder.",t2_lbniuoy8,0,6 year old with hallucinations currently hospitilized.

836,AskDocs,"32F. Was on vacation this past weekend and used a new sunscreen. That evening while washing the sunscreen off my face I started experiencing tingling and burning. That feeling persisted and worsened that evening, especially after using moisturizer lotion.

The skin was red and raw and very angry at me Saturday through Monday, but has started to improve pretty dramatically today. Much less stinging/burning, now the skin is dry and peeling and I am just keeping up with gentle moisturizing. We have assumed I had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the new sunscreen. 

However Sunday evening/Monday AM my eyes started to swell/get puffy. They’ve continued to get worse and swell more and get puffier throughout the day yesterday. The swelling under my eyes has started to go down, but today/tonight my right upper eyelid is noticeably much more swollen than my left and in general the eyelid area on both eyes is more swollen.

I saw a dermatologist this AM who called in a steroid cream that unfortunately the pharmacy messed up so I have to wait to get it until tomorrow. So I’ve essentially be treating myself with cold compresses and moisturizer. 

My question - is it normal for the eyelid swelling to occur days after the allergic reaction, and continue to get worse even if the skin is overall improving? I asked the derm this today and she shrugged and said basically I’d be fine, but that was before my right eye ballooned up this badly.

I’m terrified I’m going to fall asleep and wake up with an eye swollen shut. I shouldn’t take Benadryl (I have POTS and it gives me tachycardia) unless really needed. I guess I need some peace of mind here - how serious is eye swelling? Is it just something that’s gonna happen and I should relax or is it serious? Someone once told me that eye swelling should be an immediate ER visit but I’ve never experienced something like this …

I have this itch in my butt. It has been going on for some time. I just called the dr today, but will not be able to see a specialist until the end of next month. I put hemorrhoid cream on this bump that I thought was a hemorrhoid (according to my primary doctor) and it never disappeared, but I feel like it moved down? I am not sure if I am explaining this correct. It was up more then it moved towards my vagina.

I am typing this now and my butt it just itching. I just cleaned it. there is some feeling to it as well. like, it is bothersome. It does not like hurt painfully, but it is just itching. it is clean, dry but I feel like my butt is somewhat wet. now, my vagina is also itching. this has been going on for a month. it just itches at night most of the time. it is clean of course and there is this white substance, like a flakiness to it. it does not hurt when I pee but it just is this bothersome itching. not sure what the heck is going on. I am waiting to hear back from my ob-gyn on my results. I am actually rather pissed because it has been DAYS and they keep telling me to call back to check on my cultures.

moving on, there is a lump under my armpit. I am in the works of getting a mammogram because I was flagged when I got the first one. in a few weeks, I will be going for a diagnostic and an ultrasound to check out my breasts. they did not say anything about my armpit, but it does itch and when I rub it, it gets like a rugged burn type of thing.

does anyone think that I could have anal cancer? I went for a colonoscopy a few years ago because I wanted to get checked. however, I should have asked for the other procedure to check for anal cancer since my butt has had that hemorrhoid for 3 years. am I doomed? I have children and I do not want to leave them due to cancer. I feel fine otherwise. I am not tired but I guess that really does not mean anything, right?

Since then, I’ve been having pain all over my body near constantly. I’m talking about head, ears, neck, back, limbs, and even my fingers and toes. No fever.

The difference is that it’s also spread to my head, and occasionally it feels like my bones are burning.

839,AskDocs,"33F (female), caucasian, 5 foot 9 inches, 154 pounds, I don't take any medication or have any preexisting conditions.

Last week I got my results for a thyroid ultrasound, and they found 8 nodules:

TIRADS 2: 5mm; 6mm; 6mm; 8mm; 9mm; 15mm
TIRADS 4: 9mm x 6mm x 8mm
Not rated, colloid nodule: 6mm

My FT4 was slightly elevated, besides that the other thyroid markets (TSH, FT3) were within limits.

I was told to redo the blood tests and ultrasound again in 1 year.

For someone who wants to overly cautious, what would be the protocol for some greater reassurance that all is in order?

I imagine the TIRADS 2 nodules are not suitable for a biopsy. Is the TIRADS 4 nodule suitable for a biopsy?

Also, is it unusual for someone to have so many nodules on their thyroid?

My kids and I had a nasty upper respiratory infection last week. Covid test were negative- coughing, congestion, and sore throats that lasted all-in-all about 5 days for each of us. I would say my symptoms greatly improved on Saturday, 4/15. Sunday night, I was getting ready for bed when suddenly I had searing pain in  my left shoulder. It lasted about 5 minutes at most before it turned to just a dull ache, but mostly only if I moved or laid in a weird position. Having EDS I am no stranger to joint pain, so I assumed it was a weird shoulder subluxation and was able to go to sleep. 

When I woke up I felt like I had been kicked right in the sternum. The shoulder pain was virtually gone but I couldn’t move without pain all over my sternum, collarbones, and back- right in between my shoulder blades. 

The pain is virtually my only symptom anymore- I have a slight runny nose and headache and am pretty tired. 

My googling suggests costrochondritis… or a heart attack (which I uh… highly doubt). Assuming that’s what it is, am I safe to just wait it out at home? My husband wants me to go to urgent care but I can’t picture being able to walk in there and say “my chest hurts” without immediately being sent to the ER, which I obviously want to avoid at all costs for a multitude of reasons, cost being number 1.

For months I have been having multiple (what I think are) skipped beats a day. I counted the past two days and had 16 one day and 25 the other that I noticed while awake. I have definitely had days where there are more. They mostly happen minutes apart, but sometimes there will be 2 a minute.

I take my pulse with a heart rate app on my phone using the camera+flashlight. When the skipped beat is happening, instead of peaking like normal, the monitor sort of plateaus and then peaks. When it's happening, it feels like a /thump/ followed by a squeezing feeling of my heart, and then another /thump/.

Is there a particular name for these? When I search palpitations, it seems to be defined by heart rate (which normally is between 60-100, even when the beats are happening).

It's not itchy, it's not dry. It's just very sensitive to the touch. What I find most odd about it is, no other part of my body could he sweating, and that part will. Or I'll have gently washed it in the shower then less than an hour later that *scent* is back. Any help is greatly appreciated. So far the help I've gotten has been abysmal with responses generally limited to ""That's a stretch mark.""

With my head back three fingers fit comfortably in the gap, but with it forward I have to jam them in there. Normal range is 3-4 fingers so this concerns me. 

Also, I see the sternal notch being used as an end point for several kinds of measurements, but it seems extremely imprecise because it's a squishy circle of tissue. Where does measurement start? In the center? Jammed up against the sternum bone?

I had a referral for a scan upon request of the doctor to check fibres on my ovaries last year, chased it up twice and 10 months after that referral I was told it had been rejected by the hospital. Nobody contacted me to let me know 😂

867,AskDocs,"Hi, I recently had a chest X-ray after complaining of shortness of breath. It has been a stressful few months, so GP generally has concluded I am dealing with anxiety, and possible silent GERD or seasonal allergies. 
I seem to be able to exercise normally without breathlessness, but he sent me for a chest X-ray to rule out any serious issues.
Additionally, I did a complete bloodwork and everything was normal.

The x-Ray report itself found that:

PA and lateral. No prior x-ray available for comparison.
Cardiomediastinal contours outline normally.
Lungs and pleural spaces are clear.
Left hilum appears prominent. While this may be due to composite shadows from vessels, CT is suggested to exclude a lesion/lymphadenopathy.

The doctor called me with the results and said while they found this, he didn’t want to expose me to further radiation of a CT scan due to my age, and unless symptoms worsen, to just leave it at this stage as he didn’t think it was a problem.

While I can understand the GP concern regarding radiation, I still have the nagging concern I could be ignoring something more serious, even if the odds are low in my age bracket.

Ok so basically About 9/10 times i wake up from a nap, i feel a whole body tremor of sorts, similar to a vibration. It’s not something you would be able to notice just looking at me - it’s not an aggressive shake or even like a shiver but i can feel it. After a minute or two of being awake it subsides. Strangely enough this happens way more often when waking up from a nap than when waking from a full nights sleep, although still occasionally will happen in those instances too. 

The first i can recall this happening was about 2 years ago. Woke up from a nap feeling it and My first thought was that there was a low level earthquake happening because it felt like my bed was vibrating, but it was just me. Ever since then it happens frequently. There isn’t anything else i can correlate to it really other than being tired (which is why I’d be taking a nap).

I work from home. I realized I was doing damage to my sciatic nerve with sitting too much, and starting taking measures to mitigate. Got a cushion with the tailbone cut out, started exercising more, and got a standing desk. The pain that felt like it was more rooted in my tailbone is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there's a constant burning pain in my perineum/taint. At first it was bad, and now it's gotten to the point where it's almost intolerable. I went to immediate care who gave me a pack of methylprednisolone, and sure that made me feel better for a while, except it's done and the pain is back.

&amp;#x200B;

The pain is now spreading too. My anus burns with the same feeling. Sometimes the penis and urinary tract do as well. Peeing is not difficult, but it does hurt. I keep hydrated; even when the piss is almost as clear as the gulf of Mexico, it still hurts. I apply hemorrhoid cream to my anus to get just a slight breath of relief, but honestly it doesn't do much for very long before the burning comes back.

Today I've started this antibacterial plus urinary pain relief (Methenamine + Sodium Salicylate) but I am desperately looking for a better solution. Up to this point I've seen one immediate care doc, and a doctor of Pain Management who recommended Physical Therapy (Which I am NOT doing with this pain present).

882,AskDocs,"Hi everyone,

36 year old, white male

I have been experiencing bone pain, mostly in my arms and legs, but occasionally in my hips, hands and feet. It started October 2022 but has gotten worse since then (more intense and more frequent). Sometimes the pain feels like an ache; other times like sharp jolts or throbbing. The pain is spontaneous, frequent, jumps around from one part of the body to another, but is not long in duration in one part at any given time. It’s not made worse by activity, and it’s not made better by rest (I feel it more at rest I assume because I’m doing less and thus paying more attention). I’ve been to the doctors a few times in the past year and they’ve done an extensive rheumatological and neurological work up with all results normal.

However, I’ve had three vitamin B12 tests since June 2022, and all have come back as &gt;2,000 pg/ml, which is at least 2-3 times above the upper limit in the reference range.

I’ve had three CBC tests since Dec 2020, with these results:

Platelet counts
12/2020 = 212,000
10/2022 = 188,000
4/2023 = 165,000

Mean Platelet Volume:
12/2020 =10.4
10/2022 =10.9
4/2023 =11.4

Neutrophils:
12/2020 = 3.0 (43.4%)
10/2022 = 2.3 (42.8%)
4/2023 = 2.3 (42.8%)

Total WBC:
12/2020 =6.4
10/2022 = 5.5
4/2023 =5.47

My doctor has suggested my high B12 is probably due to diet, even though I don’t take Vitamin B12 supplements or eat fortified foods (like cereals or energy drinks). I’ve read that bone marrow disorders or cancer can be one reason (of many) for elevated B12. My doctor says my CBC is normal, which I understand, but in the context of my bone pain and all other normal results, the only thing I can think of is a bone marrow issue. I understand my platelet counts are above 150,000, which is the low end of the reference range, but that my platelet count has been decreasing and my MPV increasing has caught my attention. My neutrophils are also consistently on the low end of normal, both as an absolute count and as a %.

Should I request a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy? Or am I looking in the wrong direction? I don’t want to look to the worst possible scenario, but the pain is at the point where it wakes me up at night. My doctor says that my symptoms combined with my test results don’t point to anything specific. He has recommended a wait and see approach and to take Tylenol for pain relief. 

I’ve also noticed tiny red dots on my skin on my arms and abdomen. They look like spots of blood you can’t wipe off. I assume it’s petechiae due to my decreasing platelet count.

Backstory:
Recently took a Saridon tablet on empty stomach and started researching about it and found out it wasn’t safe, so drank milk and biscuits and thanks to some members here realised one time isn’t going to harm.

The tablet contains 150mg propyphenazone, 250mg paracetamol and 50mg caffeine. But then I read that paracetamol does not increase the risk of ulcers. 

None of these seem to cause ulcers, in fact, paracetamol is an alternative to NSAID’s for patients who are prone to ulcers.

During that month, I was sitting at one place on a hard chair for hours and hours and my body is not used to sitting continuously at one place for literally hours. During that period, I had developed a noticeable pain in my tailbone area, but I thought it would subside once I leave the job. 
It actually did kind of subside for some time but recently since a couple of weeks it has started paining too much, especially when I get up from a chair after having food or something.
Also, I was doing light low impact cardio workouts since some time.
Yesterday, I decided to do some HIGH intensity cardio and forget the pain as I thought activity would only heal it. But boy was I wrong!!
After a couple of jumping jacks and mountain climbers, when it was time to do Russian twists (where you actually have to balance your body on the tailbone area while sitting keeping your legs in the air) A DAMP SHARP PAIN pierced through my tailbone and I wasn’t able to sit on it anymore… 
And since then it’s been very difficult to sit, bend or do anything like that as the tailbone area feels worse than ever, it feels swollen and very prone to hurt more. 
Docs out there, what should I do to treat it at home? Of course I will avoid high intensity workouts. 
Besides that, do I need pelvic floor exercises? Hip mobility? 
Does doing pelvic floor exercises make the pelvic floor weak? Bcoz usually you aren’t able to feel the pelvic floor it’s all healthy and cool, but once you do the kegels and stuff, you feel the muscles, is it actually bad that you start feeling it? Or is it just better to leave the pelvic floor as it is?

I have this itch in my butt. It has been going on for some time. I just called the dr today, but will not be able to see a specialist until the end of next month. I put hemorrhoid cream on this bump that I thought was a hemorrhoid (according to my primary doctor) and it never disappeared, but I feel like it moved down? I am not sure if I am explaining this correct. I am typing this now and my butt it just itching. I just cleaned it. there is some feeling to it as well. like, it is bothersome. It does not like hurt painfully, but it is just itching. it is clean, dry but I feel like my butt is somewhat wet. now, my vagina is also itching. this has been going on for a month. it just itches at night most of the time. it is clean of course and there is this white substance, like a flakiness to it. it does not hurt when I pee but it just is this bothersome itching. not sure what the heck is going on. I am waiting to hear back from my ob-gyn on my results. I am actually rather pissed because it has been DAYS and they keep telling me to call back to check on my cultures. 

moving on, there is a lump under my armpit. I am in the works of getting a mammogram because I was flagged when I got the first one. in a few weeks, I will be going for a diagnostic and an ultrasound to check out my breasts. they did not say anything about my armpit, but it does itch and when I rub it, it gets like a rugged burn type of thing.

does anyone think that I could have anal cancer? I went for a colonoscopy a few years ago because I wanted to get checked. however, I should have asked for the other procedure to check for anal cancer since my butt has had that hemorrhoid for 3 years. am I doomed?

891,AskDocs,"(21F, 175lbs) hi. ever since I was 8-9 years old my heart has “skipped” a beat every so often, but as I got older it seemed to increase  in frequency during exercise or stress/anxiety. it feels like a clunking or an extra beat. every doctor I’ve been to has told me it’s probably a PVC, but they aren’t sure. 

- I’ve had an echocardiogram done at 9 years old (results normal)
- a 30 day heart monitor at 9 years old, told to press a button every time my heart skipped (results normal)
- multiple EKGs over the course of the past 10 years including one time where my heart skipped a beat during the test, and upon telling the ER doctor, he was confused and asked if I was sure. I don’t know how it didn’t show up
- 48 hour heart monitor at 17 years old, same as before (results normal)

recently, I decreased my dosage of my antidepressants (lexapro) from 20mg to 10mg and since then it has increased tremendously, happening anywhere from 10-probably 200 times a day. it sometimes happens every 3rd beat if I’m really nervous.

is this okay?

I'm writing on behalf of my partner, 23M, who has just gotten over a case of mono (and docs claim it's out of his system?), but has been having some intense radiating pain throughout his body, mostly involving his abdomen, chest, arm, neck and thigh. He has trouble eating and feels a sting in his chest which we believe is from acid. (Surprisingly, his life-long struggle with acid reflux has gotten better with these symptoms.) He also has been losing consciousness, which I relate to the lack of eating and the intense pain he's feeling. He will throw up sometimes, and there will be blood but it's usually very dark. 

We have been in and out of ERs because we were nervous about a heart attack (heart problems run in his family), but his vitals are completely normal. My mom said she felt this exact way years ago (without any fainting or throwing up) when she had a small stomach ulcer. He got a CT scan so we know it's not perforated or anything life-threatening, but obviously these pains are scary for him and we are looking for any answers/advice possible. He has a doc appt Friday, so from there hopefully he will be referred to a gastro doc! For now, I suppose I want to know others' knowledge and any similar experiences regarding ulcers. Thank you!

EDIT: He has been diagnosed with ulcers in the past. He was not formally tested, docs only told him years ago that his symptoms aligned with ulcers and treated it then.

some of my toe nails do this too. they have been like that for a long time, but my fingernails have never done that until recently so now i am wondering about it.

I currently go to talk therapy which has been really great at helping me work through trauma in my life and feeling at peace with things that I didn’t have control over in my life. I have been on many anti depressants and various doses over the years and that has been a really mixed bag. I am really sensitive to these drugs. Getting on off or changing doses is like riding a comet. I get relief of many anxiety symptoms - especially panic attacks, intrusive thoughts and thoughts of self harm even at low doses. I used to have really intense memories and anxiety around holidays and that’s much more manageable now. Increasing my dose doesn’t seem to bring more relief, and I get more side effects. I’m on Wellbutrin (again) and I’ve been taking it for 2 weeks. I’m so stressed out from it I’m sick. I suspect I am going to discontinue Wellbutrin 

Ongoing on just Celexa I really struggle with low energy, poor quality sleep and my body is sensitive to stress. I’m currently unemployed and I’m just stuck. I can’t seem to keep up on my responsibilities just at home let alone look for work. When I feel good I feel confident and like I have a lot to offer, things just go right, but I just can’t seem to stay in that place. 

I really want to take my life back and I’m not sure what my options are. I want to talk to my doctor about ketamine but I don’t know if they’ll go for it.

Then I noticed it was happening independent of the medicine. I see secondary outlines of objects. Flashes of white or black of the outlines. I do have slight astigmatism that I don’t need glasses for.

I’ve also had head dizziness, the kind that worsens if my head or eyes move. It can happen worse when my heart is racing. My heart sometimes skips beats, especially when dizzy.

I wrote that off as stress, and it may be. I had to tell my spouse I needed to not discuss anything contentious for a few days because the dizziness was happening all week. I attributed it to situational stress that comes with a fast heartbeat, which is caused by stress.

Could it be instead that I have headaches/migraines that worsen with stress? I don’t feel typical head pain.

915,AskDocs,"Last week a 12 pound cat had an uncontrolled fall from a shelf on the top of my head.  Fuzzy thinking for a day and a half, after the fuzzy thinking went away the nerve pain kicked in.

I have low level nerve pain at all times because of two bulging cervical discs in my neck.  This is one of the worst bouts and it's not going away.  Writing is hard, because it makes the pain worse.  I'm typing one handed.  Not typing well is impacting my job.

I want to avoid a doctor if at all possible.  I just moved, I have marketplace insurance and the current HMO nearest doctor is 150 miles away, the new closer insurance doesn't kick in until May.  And previous doctors have been really great about prescribing muscle relaxers and NSAIDs and pushing PT and not doing anything about the actual pain, they almost downplay it, even though normal level of pain is bad enough I can't use a mouse right-handed anymore.  And this ain't normal, it's really bad.

What home things can I do?  I'm about ready to dig into the remainder of my gabapentin (which my psychiatrist prescribed since he could see what the pain was doing to my mental health and the ortho surgeon thought an NSAID would cure it).  That's how bad it is.

Please help me find something to take the pain away.

So i went to hospital (11 march,2023) they took urine test and ultrasound.

They said its Epididymitis. After 1 week of taking antibiotics(ciprofloxacin) pain was gone and discomfortable was solved by 70-80%.

Are there ANY treatments I can suggest to him to look into? Anything that might not be super duper common knowledge? Any recent medical breakthroughs that can help him? Google doesn't tell me much but maybe you guys know something that can help.

Back story: A few weeks ago I had the worst asthma attack of my life, and I’ve been an athlete since I could walk. I knew I was out of shape but it worse then it should have been, plus my albuterol inhaler didn’t do anything. I messaged my doc that night to see if I could start a maintenance med so I could get back in the gym. I started the inhaler the next day. It took 3 days to be able to talk/laugh without coughing. By Friday, little symptoms that I’ve had forever got much worse. I sent in an appointment request (because the next one available to schedule normally was in June) with my symptoms. The worst being tremors, tachycardia, short of breath, and sweating. I was called by a nurse who suggest I go to urgent care. Going in, I told them that I knew many of these symptoms can be from several different causes. From anxiety, a bad med interaction, or something else, but something had changed over the last few days. They ran a series of tests based on my history.

ANA IFA was positive, with a titer of 1:1280. It showed both a homogeneous and speckled pattern. The follow up tests were positive for Sm Ab, ds DNA Ab, and TPO Ab. My current T4 free and TSH are normal.

My PCP so far has only explained the TPO by saying I will probably get Hashimoto’s one day, through a MyChart message. What I don’t understand is,

1. Why the 2 antibodies indicative of lupus are positive
2. Why my current symptoms match hyperthyroidism more then hypo.

In the emergency room ECG showed my bpm was over 200 and it reached 250 before I was administered 2 rounds of adenosine. This was 2 hours after the initial rise in heart rate. 

I had blood tests done every three hours and they showed the following troponin levels: 49 ng/L, 579 ng/L, and finally 713 ng/L.

I do have stress, holter, echo tests scheduled in the next two months.

Symptoms: months of intense on and off abdominal pain starting in the lower right quadrant and settling under the right ribs. Diarrhea, can't take a deep breath,  pressure (sometimes extreme) against lower right lung. Oxygen is normal.  Lightheaded during the day. 

This is what my latest ct scan said:  
     Subtle hypodensities are seen within the liver without mass effect,  
     best seen on the liver parenchyma windows most likely representing  
     focal areas of fatty infiltration.  No lesions are seen within the  
     spleen, pancreas.  Punctate calcification is seen within the  
     gallbladder. Persistent visualization of a fat containing small  
     lesion within the posterior cortex of the left kidney most likely an  
     angiomyolipoma. No hydronephrosis or obstructing lithiasis.  Normal  
     bladder.  Uterus is anteverted deviated towards the left side.  No  
     large adnexal lesion.  Focal mesenteric calcification is seen  
     overlying the urinary bladder previously obscured by the bowel.  

     No bowel obstruction or inflammatory changes.

Most concerning to me is a new utter inability for me to actively extend my large toe. For two weeks I have been incapable of extending my big toe beyond exactly 180degrees relative to the sole.

Approximately two weeks ago I woke at 3AM from intense lateral malleolus pain and involuntary foot plantarflexion/inversion. The severity settled from a 9/10 to a 2/10 after 20 minutes of time and massaging. Since then I have woken up most nights with a similar cramp with no real idea of the cause. The pain/cramping is always localized exactly at the right lateral malleolus.

The site is painless and non-tender at rest, not swollen or erythematous, but hurts on passive dorsiflexion, eversion, and mostly on passive extension of the large toe. No sensory deficit.

It used to be somewhat painful to walk on it, but I “treated” it with some soapy water and mild disinfect and it seemed to die down at least in terms of pain. It’s still there though, and while it’s not usually painful to walk on, it still concerned me. I suspected there was some tension from pus buildup? I’ve had problems with ingrown toenails with this same same toe before, but it ended up resolving itself before we had to go see anyone. That was on the side of the toe though, whereas this is the skin that overlaps the toe, which is confusing me to no end. Can’t find anything about it online because of that specific quality, hence the Reddit ask.

Today I bumped the toe against something, and while it was fine, some pain was noticeably hanging around and I thought I felt wetness, so I checked it. There was dried pus from earlier I guess, and some fresh pus from when I banged it, so I was correct about that I suppose. 

I’ve got a few pictures— apologies for bad quality as well as the state of my toenails. I’m aware that they’re cut incorrectly (not straight across), I did it at the time wondering if it would alleviate some pain. Also they’re chipped to heck because I’ve got some weak-ass nails.

I'm struggling with this weird bump since a few hours.
Its itching like crazy around the stoma site, bump looks like it's containing fluid, skin is starting to swell a bit and it burns a lot. This afternoon all was ok, nothing weird. Changed my bandages, cleaned up skin like always with sodium solution, got fresh sterile bandages and went on like normal. And suddenly - ITCHING LIKE HELL. Got some white/yellow discharge out of the stoma, but that's most likely some stomach fluids. 

I haven't changed anything in my routine. No new supplies, no new laundry detergent, soaps, creams or anything.

I've never had this happen before - is it safe to use some moisturising ointment and/or Betadine on it to calm the skin down? 
Or do I need to get checked for a possible fungal/bacterial infection?
I don't have a fever, headache or other issues. Just this weird annoying spot that drives me nuts.

On Saturday(4/15) I started experiencing pain while peeing, frequent urination, and only trickling pee. 
Early Sunday (3/4 am) I woke up with excruciating pain in my right side. It was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. Almost like a stabbing/shooting pain. Later on, after the pain continued to get worse and I began vomiting, I decided to go to the ER. There I was diagnosed with a severe kidney infection. 
They did a CT to check for stones, but none were found. I have the results from the cbc, urine, and metabolic panel as well. While there was given an ceftriaxone, toradol, morphine, zofran, and fluids by IV. 
I was sent home with Norco 5, Cefdinir 300mg, and zofran. 
Even with the pain medicine, the pain is still horrible and has now involved my back. 
Yesterday, I noticed that behind my left ear was swollen, warm, and very painful. I can not even lay on my side with the intensity of the pain getting worse. 

I’m not sure if I should go back to the emergency room or what. And I’m very confused as to what is happening behind my ear. Was really just hoping to get some other opinions.

968,AskDocs,"1M (9 month old male) No medications or pre-existing condition.

Last night before bed, I noticed our 9 month old had some small pink bumps on his chest and tummy. We actually had our 9 month appointment this morning, and the doctor looked at the bumps. They were present on his groin as well but as he has been acting normal and hasn’t had any fever and his vitals were good, so the doctor doubted it was anything viral and thought maybe a reaction to food or something else.

The stomach and groin don’t seem to have changed by evening, but I have noticed random little faint spots on his legs, face and arms. One of his arms had a more noticeable spot with a few smaller spots that almost look like hives.

He had mango at school yesterday at school for the first time, and chicken for the first time Sunday and Monday those are the only new things I can think of. He also had cheese yesterday at school but I think he has had it at school once or twice but I can’t remember. Could it be food?

We haven’t done anything different with his detergent, soap, lotion, etc. He’s not on any medication. He’s his happy normal self and napping and eating well. 

Any idea what this is?

He heard a popping sound and said it hurt, but wasn’t in excruciating pain. After 30 mins it started turning purple and swollen on one side, it stayed bent, and his pain got worse. He refused to go to the ED because he doesn’t have insurance and he was embarrassed. I told him there’s people that can help him get insurance and that doctors in the ED have seen much worse but he refused and said, “I’m not getting dick surgery tonight.” He put ice on it which seemed to help the swelling a little. I read a little bit about it online and some of the complications after surgery are the same as leaving it untreated. I’m wondering what the chances are of him having long term symptoms from this and if anyone knows how successful the surgery is. I don’t think I can convince him to go to the ED, I know it’s a medical emergency but he refused. Is there anything else he can do at home that might help? Thank you.

I'm asking this question because I have been experiencing a lot of the symptoms associated with low test for quite a while. I never have energy, I'm always tired. Can't get motivated. Depression. I've gained a belly over the past few years, the only symptom I seem to be missing is low sex drive. My libido is perfectly fine, in fact I wish it was lower. 

Now I know even with all of that, it doesn't mean I have low testosterone. The thing that makes me want to check is that I recently heard that my father (45 years old) has low testosterone and is taking something for it. I don't talk to him too much so I'm not sure about the specifics. Anyways, I figured it may be genetic, and maybe taking something will help improve my quality of life. 

My question is, how do I get this tested? Because everywhere I see people discuss this on Reddit I see different things. Some people say ""just go see your GP and have it tested, no biggie!"" Then others seem to talk like it's very taboo to ask to have it tested and to take tests you can buy online? I'm just confused and figured I'd ask here. Can I just call up my doc and schedule a test?

Since our trip to japan and my grandma (his mom) has had undiagnosed lung issues, his blood pressure has sky rocketed from the usual 110/85sh to 160-190. A couple months ago he woke up in a sweat and dizzy and his bp was abnormally high. The next day he looked very pale and was resting in bed. I convinced him to go to urgent care but it was inconclusive. His family doctor referred him to the ER so he wouldn’t have to wait a week to process seeing a specialist. ER kept him for two nights because no one had time to read his results and ultimately everything was inconclusive as well. They told him to take a daily aspirin exercise and eat healthy. His family doctor gave him a prescription for pills that lower his blood pressure but he cannot take more than three a day. These pills tank his BP from high to 100, and he worries it is too low so he got a pill cutter to take a half dose when necessary. He has been trying to eat even healthier (adding chia seeds to his yogurt, more veggies - he eats a single chicken drum at night with rice and veggies). My mom is currently in Taiwan to help with his grandma in his place, as the doctor warned he has a 50% chance of getting a stroke if he takes a long plane flight (it is 14 hours).

994,AskDocs,"Hello Reddit, 

I’m a 20 y/o 140 lb male. Before about 2 years ago, I never saw a doctor, except for my annual checkup. Now I have seen probably a dozen, but none seem to be able to give me the correct diagnosis.  

It started with red bleeding when I wiped. This went away after about 2 weeks. Then I started to get a really discomforting pounding feeling in my veins after I ate, swelling, cold hands, and really bad breath. I was blood tested and breath tested for h. Pylori. The breath test was negative. And the blood tests shows no abnormal results except for low nutraphils. I also had an ultrasound of my gut which showed no abnormal findings. The doctor then put me on omeprazole, thinking I had acid reflux. This shot up my blood pressure and made the pounding feelings much worse, and gave me bloody noses. The doctor also tried other antacids which gave the same results. 

After some convincing, I was put on an antibiotic for SIBO, which completely got rid of the bad breath. I was not able to finish the full 10 day course of antibiotics due to a ton of swelling in my body.
While it helped, I still did not feel good after I ate. 

Currently it feels like everything I eat, my body does not like. I have tried cutting out and limiting certain foods with little success.

Currently my body still feels swollen all the time, especially around my face and hands. My eyelids are also very red. My urine is always yellow and sticky.

As for foods that I am sensitive to, 

Egg: completely cut out of my diet now: was causing the pounding feeling in my veins, itchy throat and swelling.

Pepper: makes me sneeze once loudly after eating, red lips 

carbs: ex. Rice, ramen noodles: cold hands

Soy sauce: narrow yellow stool

Gluten: some swelling

Red meat: bloodshot eyes


I honestly don’t know what tot do now. I have seen 3 gi doctors, an Alergist, and a few other doctors. My Primary care doctor is stumped. Every test I have done including allergy tests and bloodwork come back normal except low neutrophils. I have not done a colonoscopy or endoscopy (doctors feel it’s unnecessary). 

I feel like shit all the time and I don’t want to live the rest of my life like this. What should I do?",t2_dhj7hcls,0,Can’t get a diagnosis.
