I have had this growth under my Penis foreskin for about 5 years. I am quite sure it occurred after or as a result of a foreskin tear which happened during intercourse around 5 years ago. 

I use to have really tight skin down there and was unable to pull it all the way back. One day it tore while I was having sex. After that it begun working more 'normally' and wasn't tight all the time. There was a lot of blood and I ended up going to a general admission hospital but they kind of laughed me out and said it wasn't that bad. Sometime after, this growth appeared. 

I went to a general doctor recently who told me it was likely a cyst and I shouldn't be worried about it, but im not very convinced.

14,AskDocs,"Been having issues with my hr and health since having covid last aug. Have had a clear echo, multiple ecgs and a stress test yet my issues persist. The other day I had a afib result on my watch ecg. Tonight my heart beat is for sure beating hard and strange so I’ve taken lots of ecgs that came back normal so tried the blood pressure because I know it shows that and sure enough. Honestly just at a loss. Should I go to the ER? I always feel a bit lightheaded and weird when this happens. I’m due for my period which gives me horrible grief before so I was blaming it on that. Is it always serious? 

Female aged 31
5’4/108p. No known health issues no meds. I vape nicotine/don’t drink or do drugs.

18,AskDocs,"I have had foot pain since January.   I am in my Mid 40s, female, 150 lbs. I was sick on and off all winter spending a lot of time in bed (respiratory viruses complicated by asthma and got weak). When I felt better in late December/early January, I hit the ground running doing a lot of training trying to get strength and fitness levels back.  My day job is at a desk but when healthy  I spend 10-15 hours a week dancing.  I also do a fair bit of hiking and yoga.  I did probably too much releve (ballet exercise) trying to strengthen foot and ankles and noticed increasing foot pain.  I saw  my GP who diagnosed tendinitis and  ordered xrays to make sure there wasn't a stress fracture. I decreased activity by about 50%, wore supportive shoes, iced the foot, tried NSAIDs and did all the things the doctor recommended.   It wasn't getting better and kept getting a bit worse. I was diagnosed with likely sesamoiditis but an MRI was ordered to verify and make sure nothing else was going on and meanswhile I was ordered to stay off my feet as much as possible, limit walking, absolutely no hiking and no dancing. I was told I could bike and swim for exercise. Even biking a few miles on level ground seems to irritate my foot. I've been mostly off my feet for about 10 days and the pain isn't much better, it's fairly constant but becomes worse with weight bearing activity.  Ibprofen doesn't seem to help. Icing temporarily alleviates pain somewhat.

I finally had my MRI this week and wait to see the specialist next week. Below is the MRI report. I don't currently have access to the images.

Questions:   
How long is the likely recovery time from a  focal subcutaneous edema within the medial first toe near the MTP joint ?   
What are the treatment options?    
When can I likely return to dancing and hiking?    
Is there anything that would help with the pain? It's not the worst pain I've had in my life but it's fairly constant and draining and not pleasant  
What does ""compatible with stress reaction."" in the MRI report mean -- over use injury due ot stress on the bone?    
Thanks!

I've been bleeding lightly on and off (brown, red, discharge) since my last period 'ended' 2 weeks ago. No other symptoms. Made an appointment with my doctor for Monday morning. Last night I decided to have a look and see if I have a small cut or any irritation that I can't feel.

I seem to have an elongated, pink/pale flesh protusion coming out of my vaginal entrance. Flexible, not stiff or solid. Nothing I'm googling looks quite like it - cervical polyps aren't supposed to protude that far, prolapses are rounded etc etc.

Just wondering if I need to take the day off work on Monday if she's about to tell me I have cancer or something horrific.

23,AskDocs,"Hello! 

I started tret 0.025% cream (prescribed by my derm) for the last 6 weeks for acne (anti-aging is a plus!). I was instructed to apply a pea sized amount every night to my face. After three nights, my skin was irritated so I'm sure I compromised my skin barrier somewhere. Stopped for the next 2 nights to restore the barrier. 

Then I decided to apply every other night and there was no longer any irritation/redness. All was fine. However, I have suuuuuuper dry skin and tret is just extra drying. I was told to wait for 20 minutes after tret application to moisturize. But in that 20min window, my skin feels supeeeer tight. I have sensory problems so the tightness bothers me more than it should. 

My questions are

1) is it necessary to wait for that long before applying my moisturizer? Would applying it too soon irritate me?  

2) I was also prescribed Clindamycin 1% topical lotion to apply to my face every morning. Should I be worried about antibiotic resistance if I am continuously applying for months? 

Skincare routine: 

AM: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, Clindamycin 1% topical, LRP Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream, Supergoop Unseen SPF 

PM: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, CosRx Snail Mucin Essence (let to dry \~15min), tret (every other night, let to dry \~20min), LRP Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream

Medications: just the clindamycin and tret, occasionally calcium vitamins i remember

Hello 

I am a 33yo pregnant woman (39 weeks) with a current weight of 165lbs (usually 130lbs) and healthy overall. I don’t smoke. I’ve been active my whole pregnancy and regularly exercise 5x/ week, drink water, low stress job, but sleep is total CRAP.  

I’ve had a series of medical issues that make me wonder if they’d Re related, or if I’m doing something to trigger them. Everyone says it’s because I’m “pregnant” but I think there’s a color elation somewhere 

A month ago, the crown on my back tooth randomly fell out. Wasn’t eating anything hard…

Last week, Thursday - Saturday  I was extremely fatigued, and not pregnant tired or anything, but couldn’t get out of bed i was so tired. I am usually never even sitting down, and always down to go out, cook, hang etc… 

While I was sick last week, I was congested at a normal level. 

2 days after my cold, on Monday, I wake up with what was diagnosed as pink eye and start antibiotic drops (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 

4 days later after being sick with a “cold” and getting pink eye I am still somewhat congested and coughing

On Wednesday, 4 days since cold symptoms began, I loose complete sense of taste and smell. Like NOTHING. keep testing negative for covid 19. I mean, i could drink and snug liquid diarrhea and not know it. It’s been like this for 2 days now. 

And just tonight I developed extreme ringing in my left ear, and a ton of pressure. I take diuretics because i hold liquid and get vertigo and haven’t skipped my meds or anything (Hydrochlorothiazide)

What is going on?!!!


SUMMARY:

cold symptoms 
Pink eye 
Loss of taste and smell
Negative covid / negative flu
Ringing in ears 

Medications I take:

ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution (pink eye)
Hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic for vertigo, daily)
Prenatals  (pregnancy)

29,AskDocs,"Six months ago, I went to the ER with stomach pain. A CT without contrast detected early appendicitis with incidental finding of a vague hypodense lesion on my right hepatic lobe. A lap appendectomy was performed.

A recent follow-up MRI with and without contrast to look into the incidental finding showed: an enlarged liver (18 cm), two hemangiomas (right lobe), and one mass consistent (left lobe) with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). No suspicious hepatic lesions. All follow-up blood labs came back normal (comprehensive metabolic panel, partial thromboplastin time activated, prothrombin time INR, &amp; alpha fetoprotein tumor marker). My most recent CBC was also normal.

Questions:

1. How can all my blood tests be normal if my liver is enlarged?
2. Wouldn't the MRI and/or any of these blood tests have detected fatty liver or an infection?
3. How concerned should I be that the hospital listed the wrong order on the top of my MRI results and appointment notes? The order was specifically for the vague hypodense lesion on my right lobe, but the MRI report said I was there because of ""non-visualization of gallbladder.""

My left arm spontaneously goes dead/no sensitivity, and my heart rate bumps up aggressively even while resting. Driving me faint and short of breath. My thighs ache along what feel like a thick surface vein on the inside of the thigh. I’ve had an EKG and a CT, as well as blood testing, yet they’ve found nothing.

Ankle injury three weeks ago.  X-ray at the time showed soft tissue swelling, no fracture.  They gave me a boot.  Three weeks later (a day ago) and I still have decent amount of pain when walking/stretching my foot.  It is tender and sore to the touch (with some pressure).  They did a new x-ray today and found a fracture.  They gave me a new boot that goes higher up on my leg, to right under my knee.

Radiology report is as follows: ""There is now evident is a healing fracture along the lateral malleolus which is transverse at the level of ankle joint line. The fracture is nondisplaced. It was not radiographically evident on the prior radiographs. Ankle mortise is intact. Soft tissue swelling is decreased. There is no definite ankle joint effusion. The remaining portions of the tibia fibula are unremarkable.""

This is pretty much all the information I have.  I can say I am able to walk on it and put some pressure on it without (extreme) pain, but should I be?  Student health did not indicate I should not bear any weight on my ankle.

Based on this information, can I continue to walk on it in a boot?  Are there additional things I need to ask the doctors?

There was no discussion or mention of a cast.  Is this necessary?  I want my ankle to properly heal with no long-term side effects.

This began this year, first with laying on my back, then progressing to when sitting upright, and now also includes being very breathless after walking downstairs to get water or something similar. When sitting upright, I feel like I need to take a huge breath in and try to release all of it for relief, but it doesn’t help very much. The same goes for feeling like if I could just stretch my torso “tall” enough, I’d be able to breathe, but it only helps a little bit. It’s all much worse in the past 2 months. I’m also noticing I’m often freezing cold over the past few weeks, even when the thermostat says 71.

In my health history, I was on a ventilator after being born premature, with the only permanent effect being inability to hold my breath very long. I’ve never had breathing issues like this. I played sports and ran track with no problems. At 19 I developed unexplained suspected SA node tachycardia and a “near” prolapse mitral valve, both of which run in the family but usually don’t occur until 40’s.

Almost every day at random points, I will abruptly feel my head fill up with pressure. It’s such intense pressure that I get scared that I’m going to stroke out or have an aneurysm and that anxiety makes the feeling worse. It’s usually when I’m having a stressful moment, but not always. Sometimes it’s just random.

The pressure also affects my eyes and makes it really hard for me to function until it passes.
I just got my eyes checked and they looked fine apart from “slightly high intraocular pressure”, that they will be monitoring a year from now.

I have also had blood work and EKGS done 3 times in the last year. All normal.

Sometimes I will also feel these weird, random sharp stabbing sensations on top and around my head and scalp. They are not really painful. More so annoying and worrying. I had this happen for a week straight about two years ago but it went away for a while.
This time, it’s been a little over a week that this particular symptom has been going on.
In the past, I was not someone that was prone to having headaches. Maybe once or twice a year, and if I had them, they were so mild that I didn’t need medication.

My other symptom is about 3 times a week, I will wake up and feel like absolute death. I feel like I can’t move and like I just need to focus on breathing. It feels like I have a severe flu. I think this feeling has been exacerbated by my blood pressure med. I feel severe malaise on it in between moments of extreme anxiety. I get through the day by taking a vitamin complex/caffeinated mint that I take only a bite of in the mornings because anymore gives me anxiety. I always feel a lot better for a while on it.

My blood pressure swings dramatically throughout the day. Just going up three flights of stairs shot it up to 149/100. After sitting for a minute, it went down to 124/81. These swings are very scary.

I am just at the borderline of being obese but I am working on it. Exercise has been extremely difficult with the exhaustion I’m experiencing. Most nights, the most I can manage is 20 minutes on the elliptical. I also am on my feet about 8 hours a day at work, so I wouldn’t say I’m sedentary, but I definitely don’t get adequate exercise.

I have suddenly become very sodium sensitive. I am making sure that I look at nutrition facts and calculating my daily value percentage, but lately I feel bad just after eating any at all.

I am also experiencing tinnitus on and off at an increasing frequency. It’s now several times a day.

My quality of life has been terrible. I am a bit of a hypochondriac, so I cannot tell what is my brain producing these symptoms and what is actually my body. I have constant alarm bells going off in my mind telling me to go to the ER.

It feels like something is very off with one of the functions in my body. Maybe my vascular system. Particularly in my chest and head area.

I have high deductible insurance and I am hesitant to get an MRI or something just for my peace of mind.

Doctors have been less than helpful. I constantly get “You’re so young. I’m not worried.” And mentioning my mental health issues? FORGET ABOUT IT. They’re just like “oh, she’s a hypochondriac…” The normal labs don’t help either.

Please, if you could give me some ideas to mention to my doctor, that would be great.

54,AskDocs,"I’m a 28 year old female who was recently medicated for the first time on amphetamine for severe ADHD. I have been on the medication for about 2 and a half weeks. 

That being said, I have a seemingly rare ability (I thought it was normal until it was gone and began to speak about it) to have near total and perfect recall of events that I have lived through (but can also easily suppress memories that are non important). I’m not sure if it’s photographic memory, or perfect eidetic memory or even a combination of both.  My first memory starts when I was around 18 months- 2 years old and I can recall almost everything from that moment. I remember every family members’ social security numbers, every phone number I have ever been given, I excel at science and math etc etc., because I do not forget anything I read or anything I see. I forget almost everything I hear. I have been known to hold random bits of information, be able to read excerpts of papers and journals from my head to match the conversational topic and recall where I have read the information on many, many occasions- often times being a book I read 10+ years ago. 

However, once prescribed the medication, this ability immediately stopped. I have no photographic memory until the *next day* and *only if I don’t take another dose*. It’s almost as if it reboots my brain, very slowly. It can be nice, for sure, however, I do not understand how to learn and retain information (study) anymore as it is suppressing my memory. I am having trouble going back into my brain and remembering my card numbers, looking at my path that I walked to see where I placed my keys or folders, etc. 

I mentioned this to my psychiatrist who prescribed it (for ADHD) and he was clearly bewildered and said to keep taking it and see what happens. However, since finding out my recall ability is fairly rare, I’m concerned that there could be long-term effects with my memory from the medication if I continue to take it. Im searching for studies that may point in one way or the other, but cannot find anything either way and do not have access to paid journals.

The area on my side but right below chest hurts like a cramp sometimes if I crunch it a certain way, what organ is that first of all, and what could it be? I was just sitting and I leaned into it the wrong way and it seized up hard and very painfully and I just rubbed it and stood up and kept rubbing till it went away but it was scary...like a charlyhorse for my rib. Like if I didn't stand up and rub it in time it would've broken or something, the pain was steadily increasing. Makes me have to do ab exercises/strretches very carefully so I dont accidentally trigger it. If it happens during ab exercises I just lay there and rub till its gone.

81,AskDocs,"40M (AFAB), 5’6”, 175lbs, caucasian

Primary complaint: sudden intense dizziness while sitting/laying down. Goes away as quickly as it starts.

Meds: Been on testosterone (1mL/every two weeks) since Oct 2016 (injected IM). Started taking 81mg of chewable aspirin about a week ago out of concern for heart health (not directed by doctor). Albuterol for asthma as needed.

Lifestyle: Current nonsmoker, but have smoked off/on for many years. Last cig was about a month ago. I’ve never eaten very healthy, eat a lot of processed foods and sweets. No recreational drugs, drink sometimes on weekends.

A little background: I’ve been having pulsatile tinnitus in my left ear since about Oct 2022 (it goes away when I lie down or tilt my head to the left), it was pretty mild but got worse the past two months or so, so I made an appt with an ENT. He ordered an MRI and MRA which I had done and just got the results back (mostly unremarkable, see below). I meet with him for a follow up next week on Wednesday the 19th. 

I’m concerned because this morning (around 9am maybe) I was sitting at my desk and I leaned forward just a bit and was hit with a sudden intense dizziness, I thought I was going to immediately pass out. It went away almost as quickly as it came on, it was just a couple seconds but it was overwhelming. I talked myself into being okay, but just 20 minutes ago I was laying on my couch going through my phone and it happened again. It was so intense, I felt like I was going to black out out of nowhere. Both of these times I hadn’t done any recent sudden movements, I had already been sitting/laying for a bit. My heart also didn't feel like it was beating heavily afterwards nor did it feel like trying to catch my breath when it would go away (it didn't feel like my heart stopped beating for a second or anything). Is this something I should go to the ER for? 

Some other things to note, in the past 3 or so months I’ve experienced being out of breath while lying down - about 5 or 6 times total in the last 3 months, and mostly while lying in bed. It’s like my heart can’t catch up with my breath or something. It would go away in about 10 or 20 minutes. These weren’t anxiety attacks (though I do experience anxiety), they seemed very random. I had read recently that aspirin can be good for heart health so that’s why I started taking it. Could the aspirin be part of the issue with this sudden onset of dizziness spells?  I’m feeling anxious now, would taking a xanax be helpful or no? I usually only use xanax before flights which is about 3x a year.

Any insight would be helpful, but I'm mostly concerned if I should seek immediate medical attention or not. I feel fine right now, just a little anxious from this happening.

Below are my MRI/MRA results:

**EXAM: MR BRAIN AND IAC WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST**

**FINDINGS**:

Brain: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or significant intracranial mass effect. Diffusion-weighted images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct or other restricted diffusion. No hemosiderin deposition or unexpected mineralization is identified. No abnormal intracranial contrast enhancement is seen. No hydrocephalus, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collections. Midline structures are intact. Major intracranial flow voids are preserved. The right jugular bulb may be slightly high riding. Visualized bones and orbits demonstrate no significant abnormalities. There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, with opacification of the posterior right ethmoid air cell.

IACs/Temporal Bones: There is no abnormal enhancement of the inner ears, IACs or CPAs. No mass in the internal auditory canals or CPAs is defined. The mastoid air cells are free of abnormal enhancement. There is trace fluid signal in the right mastoid tip. Normal fluid signal is noted in the vestibular and cochlear labyrinth. There is no enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct. There is no evidence of a dehiscent SSC.

**CONCLUSION**:

1. No significant intracranial abnormality or abnormal intracranial contrast enhancement.

2. The right jugular bulb may be slightly high riding. Otherwise, unremarkable MRI of the internal auditory canals, with and without IV contrast.

3. Paranasal sinus disease, with trace fluid signal in the right mastoid tip.

**EXAM: MRA BRAIN/HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST**

**FINDINGS**: The distal cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of both internal carotid arteries are widely patent and unremarkable. Posterior communicating arteries are present bilaterally. The ICA bifurcations are unremarkable. The A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery is hypoplastic. The right A1 is unremarkable. A patent anterior communicating artery is present. A2 segments and distal ACA branches fill normally. The middle cerebral arteries are unremarkable bilaterally.

Distal vertebral arteries are grossly unremarkable, with the left vertebral artery dominant. Both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are patent. The vertebrobasilar junction, basilar trunk, and basilar apex are unremarkable. Posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries fill normally.

**CONCLUSION**:

1.

What are the chances of of getting rabies from a feral cat scratch? The cat honestly looked healthy and was eating the food I gave. She had some kittens with her too. I tried going back 4-5 days after the scratch to see if the cat was still there but she relocated so I have no idea what happened to her. I also looked up CA rabies data and it's mainly bats/skunks in my county had 0 cases of rabid cats, but I'm concerned the data isn't accurate as animals could die from rabies that Animal Control never finds. Am I being paranoid or is there a possibility that I'm going die from rabies?

No history of asthma, never smoked, no high altitudes. Socially drink.

I went today for the check up ….
I’ve been feeling much better than I have in months. Doctor ask me how I feel…. I tell him that I feel great! (I have felt better the last few weeks than I have in months).  Hopefully that means my numbers are better. But he said no they didn’t go down, the numbers actually went up. 


So, I’ve been scheduled for a bone marrow biopsy. I go next week.

Todays test results - https://imgur.com/a/2vLpm2o

So my questions . He mentioned a polycythemia that can happen when your Jak2 negative. But said “it’s rare”. I was a little in shock mode over my numbers being bad and didn’t quite hear him explain this part. I wish I would have asked him again. But I was just bummed at the news and also the idea of the biopsy… do you know what his thoughts may have been to reexplain this part to me? Is this something a biopsy can pick up?

Are the numbers in my results super concerning? I mean he seemed like they are and said we need to figure it out. But I’ve had other health scares where the specialist had me scared to death only to be told …. Eh it’s nothing (masses on my lungs, that were determined just to be scar tissue). 

Is there anything health wise that I could be doing to myself to cause this to happen?  Can it be caused by meds I take (like can the semiglutide cause it? I get asked this by my family a LOT ….)? Drinking alcohol (several yrs ago I was in a dark place and was drinking about 2 bottles of wine a night, it was bad… I stopped drinking wine about 2 yrs ago. I drink some still. But usually it’s just a gin and sprite mixed drink after work. Nothing crazy like before).

97,AskDocs,"Ever since giving birth almost 3 months ago I have had this near constant slight sensation of lightheadedness, as well as these awful jolts of overwhelming lightheadedness that are accompanied by a fullness in the ears when I quickly move my head or eyes. It doesn’t happen every single time, but more often than not. If I am intentional about slowly tracking my eyes while slowly moving my head, it doesn’t happen. It’s when I move my head and quickly move my eyes along with my head without slowly tracking them to their new position that it happens. It’s incredibly uncomfortable and jarring each time, and sort of feels like my brain has to catch up with my head. I do NOT have a spinning sensation, and Epley maneuver does nothing. I also see random spots of light throughout the day, but the timing of these doesn’t seem to be connected to the lightheadedness.

For background, I have TMJ on one side that I believe was exacerbated during labor - my teeth couldn’t even touch on that side when I bit down for several days after giving birth. I also had tinnitus immediately following labor that lasted about a month. I think the lightheadedness began sometime in the first week or two, and I initially attributed it to sleep deprivation (I was only getting about 2-3 hours every 24 hours). I also get frequent migraines which have worsened since delivering, and I have a slight chiari malformation. Also have chronic neck pain that I regularly see a chiropractor for.

100,AskDocs,"Hello, so I have had shisha-smoking induced anosmia for many years now. Almost no sense of smell at all. I quit smoking a lot of times but my sense of smell never really recovered. Untill last summer when I got a pretty bad food poisoning, my sense of smell suddenly came back %100, literally overnight, after my poisoning. As a matter of fact, my sense of smell came back sharper than it has ever been. I thought a lot about what caused it and I decided it was either one of the meds I was prescribed (about 5 or so) or the intense purging (I threw up blood).

Anyway, flashforward to last month, I had been anosmic for months again and I had nausea, and I took one of the anti-nausea pills I still had from my poisoning last summer. And boom, my sense of smell came back again, in the same sharp way, next day! And now it's gone. I have to add, I haven't smoked shisha since early November, and I had a few weeks of break from smoking as well when I had food poisoning last summer too.

Anyway, this took longer than I expected. I wanted to ask if anyone ever heard such a thing before? Nothing came up on my searches on the internet. Also, any general recommendations to get rid of anosmia is welcome as well. Thank you

109,AskDocs,"Let me just start by saying this - I have complained about this to doctors in the past, and I have seen 2 physiotherapists about it too (regarding specific mobility issues) - but i've never actually asked about my general poor mobility. 

I'm a 23 year old male, I have very mild sports-induced asthma, and I take no medication (beyond a blue inhaler when needed) or anything like that. 

The reason this is so concerning to me is because I try to be a very active person. I play many sports, and have been going to the gym (on and off) since I was 14 - and despite an almost DECADE of trying to take the gym seriously - I still cannot for the life of me perform a proper squat or deadlift (I can't even get CLOSE). I have took many breaks from the gym in order to SOLELY FOCUS on my mobility (stretching and strengthening exercised - DAILY for long periods of time) - but I have NEVER seen an improvement in my mobility. 

I can't even scratch 70% of my back. My shoulders, ankles, and upperback are all extremely stiff, and my range of motion is extremely limited compared to most other people. 

This has caused me so many problems in maintaining an active lifestyle. I used to run a lot (18 miles a week) and I was a very good runner - but all of a sudden I developed 'chronic compartment syndrome' in my tibialis anterior (or at least my last physiotherapist agreed that it was highly likely). Like, I was able to run 10 miles at a time at an 8:30 min/mile easily - and then all of a sudden I could no longer run for longer than 5 minutes before my shins started to burn due to inflammation and pressure build up (not shin splints). It just makes no sense to me. I feel like I MUST have something wrong with my connective tissue, or something like that. Very deep shoulder sockets, stiff ankle joints, and rounded upper back - and this is all despite a very active childhood. 

I have probably spent days of my life simply stretching and no results have ever come from it. I simply cannot perform certain exercises with good form. I'm a generally strong individual (for my size), and most people would perhaps consider me 'heavy-set' in the way that I have a wide and stocky frame. It's easy to read about hyper-mobility on the internet where people have problems that cause their joints to dislocate - but I feel like I have the opposite problem - i'm hypo-mobile instead! Unfortunately, I can never find any information regarding this on the internet at all. 

It's honestly driving me crazy now. Every time I try to make an effort to get back into the gym and to be more active - i'm just stopped right in my tracks from all sorts of mobility issues. I try to stretch (and run a little bit) as regularly as I can (with adequate rest periods) but I never increase my range of motion - and i can never go further than half a mile before I have to stop because my shins are on fire. I'm just completely dumbfounded at this point.",t2_lsohj,0,My body is SERIOUSLY inflexible and immobile.

She was over 200 lbs at the time, around 220ish I think off the top of my head. But since then she has treated it as if it's the final verdict on eating. Yesterday when I began my direct care of her I noticed she only had about 500 calories the entire day. Acting as if a few candies, some soup, half a small meat wrap that used lettuce as the wrap was sufficient to last her from the morning till she got home from the hospital around 6pm. Which is when she ate only a small amount of pudding and the other half of that small wrap. She was also really unstable and def weak when she came home. She's always had trouble raising her crushed foot (very old injury, she basically has a foot with a fused ankle) but now it is atrociously bad. She's had a series of falls recently that was the cause of her going. All of these events made me reflect on the past and realize she has had plenty of days where she will have less then a thousand calories or just barely above it. The fact she over the last few years has had an easier time falling down to now when she can fall just tryin to walk and that she told me ""i'm not starving myself i'm just not hungry"" has made me think this is contributing more then I realized until now. I fear she has just gotten so used to this 50 carb diet that she can no longer recognize the symptoms that come from not eating enough. Am I overreacting?  


To give more info on those falls. She fell in january, hit her side on the table then fell on the ground. She had a good deal of back pain and had to take it a bit easier. She apparently had so much pain that she couldn't sleep well if at all. However not only did her doctor take over a month to get back to her, he did not give her any kind of pain reliever despite advil and tylenol not helping much if at all and these issues not only lasting but slowly getting worse over the entire time up until now. No x-ray ordered, nothing. Just an explenation that she's old and will take longer to heal. 4 days ago she fell but it was thankfully pretty uneventful but she fell again 2 days ago. In this fall she broke her wrist (which we found out was broken the next day). She went to the hospital got some x-rays and her arm is in a cast and sling. Despite the proven broken wrist she was not given even one dose of painkillers to help tide her over until she can see a doc specializing in bones. She has been given them before with her current meds as well, so that confuses and angers me honestly as she def can't sleep right now.

A little background information- In September 2022 I went into emergency for an incarcerated umbilical hernia. I had it repaired, the following week I had an infection post op &amp; had a ultrasound done to confirm a seroma. Two weeks later the infection had cleared &amp; I continued to heal well. 

Fast forward to this past Tuesday afternoon… I started to feel the same pain &amp; noticed the redness returning to the area. I decided to go to emergency, after an extensive ultrasound (I refused a ct as I’ve had far too many in the last 3 years) the said there was no hernia found. Instead they said the area is infected and put me on 500mg of ceflaxin 4 times a day for 7 days. I’ve been on the antibiotics for 72 hours and now have noticed my belly &amp; umbilical area swelling.

INDICATION: Pelvic and perineal pain. History of difficult conception and ectopic pregnancy with partial tube removal.
 
COMPARISON: Ovary ultrasound 6/29/2021, CT abdomen pelvis 5/17/2022
 
TECHNIQUE: Ultrasound imaging of the pelvis was performed using two-dimensional gray scale imaging. Transvaginal technique was utilized for better visualization of the uterus and adnexa. Color Doppler images were obtained to evaluate vascular flow. Transabdominal imaging was not performed. This interpretation assumes a nonpregnant patient. If the pregnancy status of this patient is unknown, the results of this exam may be invalid.
 
LMP: 4/2/2023
 
FINDINGS:     
 
Uterus: 
Orientation: Anteverted
Myometrium: Uniform homogenous myometrial echotexture with scattered vessels noted throughout. No fibroids.
Endometrial Thickness: 9.7 mm
Endometrium: A solid 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm lesion is present in the endometrium that is isoechoic to the myometrium.
Uterus Size: 8.6 x 3.5 x 5.4 cm
Uterus Volume: 85.4 ml
Cervix: Normal
 
Right Adnexa:
Adnexa: No mass or fallopian tube dilation. 
Ovary: Normal ultrasound morphology. Dominant follicle.
Ovary Size/Volume: 4.2 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm, 9.1 ml, (mean volume for age, 4.8 ml)
Ovary Flow: Color Doppler flow confirmed.
 
Left Adnexa:
Adnexa: No mass or fallopian tube dilation. Tortuous vessels noted adjacent to the left adnexa with increased flow on Valsalva.
Ovary: Normal ultrasound morphology. Dominant follicle.
Ovary Size/Volume: 3.8 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm, 9.9 ml, (mean volume for age, 4.8 ml)
Ovary Flow: Color Doppler flow confirmed.
 
Pelvic Fluid: No abnormal pelvic fluid is present. 
 
IMPRESSION:     
1.  A solid endometrial 3.8 cm lesion is identified. Recommend gynecological follow-up and possible saline-infused sonohysterogram versus hysteroscopic evaluation.

130,AskDocs,"This started about a month and a half ago. It started with a faint weird tingling/numbness in my heels which I chalked up to plantar fasciitis or something similar. However I soon became to experience an intense tingling in both feet and up both legs, and in my hands and forearms. I now wake up almost every morning with both hands entirely numb (they wake up after a few seconds of moving them around but still vaguely achy for a while after I get up) and they tingle and burn throughout the day. 

I also have sometimes faint, sometimes intense parasthesias on my scalp. It's hard to explain but sometimes it feels like someone pressing a finger onto my scalp or scratching me on the head. It's not localized to any one part of the head. I have also had on-and-off severe headaches. Finally, I've had a couple of weird muscle spasm episodes while working out – if I engage my abs even slightly they spasm over and over for 1-2 minutes and it is extremely painful. 

I went to the doctor last week and had a workup that included a comprehensive metabolic panel, magnesium/B12/iron tests,  anti-nuclear antibody, and Sjögren's antibody (I was diagnosed with Sjögren's 7 years ago after a similar episode but none of my doctors since have been convinced). Everything came back normal. My doctor called me to tell me that I likely just have anxiety and carpal tunnel syndrome and should come back in a month to see if things have changed. It was her opinion that any imaging at this point would be a ""waste of time and money"" as it is likely something transient.  

Meanwhile, I feel like I'm getting worse. I have recently developed a bit of light sensitivity and driving during the day feels weird – I can barely drive around without sunglasses. I don't have vertigo or balance issues for now but certain movements just feel strange, almost like my depth perception is altered.

131,AskDocs,"TLDR: 

Age:24

Diagnosis: GERD, Approx 10 yrs ago

Medication: Does Not help

Frequency: Every Day

Symptoms: 

Heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, chronic cough, sore throat, inflamed esophagus, hoarse voice, vomiting, shortness of breath, flutter/twitching/abdominal pain.

Drugs: None, don't drink or smoke either

I was diagnosed with GERD approx 10 years ago. It came on very subtly but had an immediate increase in frequency. Originally, my only symptoms were Heartburn, Regurgitation, &amp; Chest pain. After mentioning this to my PCP, I was referred to a specialist. My gerd symptoms were normal and could be addressed with lifestyle changes (dietary). The abnormal was my heart arrhythmia and palpitations (turned out to be nothing serious). I was to keep an eye on my chest pain and hand over my ekg results if I were hospitalized for anything chest related.

About 3 years later my Symptoms started to worsen, once or twice a month was no longer the norm. Symptoms happened twice a week at minimum. My QOL visibly dropped and I was prescribed medications. Before medication was prescribed, my pcp explained to me that meds would not cure, but they would mitigate the issue. Unfortunately, they did not help. I was still very active around this time and had drastically changed my diet but to no avail. I went through a variety of meds, including but not limited to: Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Pantropazole, Sucralfate, Tums, Amoxicillin, Hydroxyzine, Ondasetron and many others. I was told lifestyle changes were necessary and I was “too young for that” . I also cut out certain foods and tried to mix/match to see if anything specific was affecting me. It all sucked.

A brief summary before I continue. I do not drink coffee nor have I ever enjoyed it. Nor do I drink soda, eat junk food, use chili, or eat chocolate. A pamphlet was handed to me stating all the things I need to avoid living with gerd. Well, nothing on that list is in my diet anyways!

Fast forward, it is now 2019 and I have developed a chronic cough. This baffled me at first, the cough was often accompanied with mucus but I had no signs of the flu. After a visit to the doctor, I was given cough medicine and antibiotics?) ( don't really remember). I was told to come back after a month if my cough continued. Well, I did not come back. Working 70 hour weeks really messes up your schedule. I finally made time towards the beginning of 2020, Boy was that unfortunate. The pandemic started and no doctor would see me. I would show up to different locations and was immediately turned away after stating I had a chronic cough. My QOL completely tanked. I could no longer eat or drink anything without coughing up a storm. The acid reflux also got a lot worse at night. Sleepless nights became an all too common occurrence in this era.

It is now 2021, I have quit my job. I am weak and unable to do the job any longer. I decided to take about 3 months of vacation to address my health issues. That did not happen, instead I was greeted by multiple life threatening family emergencies throughout the year. My stress levels skyrocketed and my symptoms grew at an enormous pace. Now, many nights of rest were only 2-4 hours. My voice became hoarse from all the coughing. Heartburn and regurgitation increased in severity and was now almost daily. My esophagus was constantly inflamed and a shortness of breath had developed. To summarize, these symptoms happen every time I eat or drink anything. It does not happen all at once nor do all symptoms present themselves. Some days I will only have heartburn and coughing. Other days I will have coughing and regurgitation. On unfortunate days, all symptoms will present themselves.  It is a vicious cycle.

The year is 2022. I sleep 1-2 hours a day. I will often have a day in the week where I sleep 12-16 hours. My coughing is now unbearably strong and often is accompanied by vomiting.  I will spend most of the day sitting by the restroom, ready to respond. Walking up the stairs has become impossibly difficult. Walking to get groceries will often tire me out the same way running a few miles did. Once again I return to the doctor, only to be prescribed the same meds I've been on before. Blood was drawn multiple times and results were perfectly normal. An H. Pylori test was ordered twice and both were negative. A variety of stds and other diseases were tested. All came back negative. My pcp referred me to a gastroenterologist, Neurologist, and cardiologist. Gastro and neuro were both denied by the insurance company. Around the same time, I had a hospital visit, due to constant vomiting. (worst day of the year). There the doctors showed concern about my ekg, i then explained how it's not an issue and got tested around 10 years ago. They pushed me to see a cardiologist because “I have the heart of a 40 year old”. They wrote a referral letter to my pcp, pushing a cardiologist visit. It was approved and my appointment was set. After visiting my cardiologist and running through the tests, it was concluded that my heart was perfectly healthy and is just a weirdo. I've also given up on diets etc, if i'm gonna suffer the same way from eating a carrot as i would a pizza then i'll opt for the pizza.

2023 has rolled around. New symptoms have developed. I now have pain in my abdomen (not my appendix I promise….it's removed) . My stomach also flutters? Twitches? Not sure how to describe it.

134,AskDocs,"Hi! I'll just get to it. I (26F) have been dealing with a multitude of health issues with seemingly no direct cause. I lived in Hoosick Falls NY for 4 years when I was a preteen-teen, and am concerned that my issues are related to the massive PFOA poisoning in the water there. [https://pfasproject.com/hoosick-falls-new-york/](https://pfasproject.com/hoosick-falls-new-york/)

I would so appreciate if anyone of you on here with medical knowledge could help me connect some dots, even if not to the PFOAs. I'm starting to feel so wrapped up in my healthy and terrified of the next issue that will pop up. 

Moved to Hoosick Falls when I was 10 and left when I was 14. 

I have never smoked, drank very lightly around age 21, and live a relatively clean and active life. I have always been in the ""healthy"" range for body mass.

Hirsutism onset around age 16, no ovarian issues detected. Waiting on an endocrineologist appointment for more insight. 

Barthollin Gland cysts and abscesses with nearly every period. I have been on hormonal birth control to prevent these since I was 18.

Chronic yeast infections (4/5 yearly)

&amp;#x200B;

Chronic UTIs (every other month) since I was 14. Often different bacteria in cultures. I had a cycstoscope done which found nothing, a CT scan which found nothing structually wrong, but a bit of gas in the bladder. Prophalactic antibiotics have helped immensely. (I have tried every single thing in the last 12 years as far as lifestyle changes, to no avail. Sometimes the only thing found in the culture is just normal flora)

Based on neurological issues my doctor suspects Transverse Myelitis or MS. I did not realize how many of my symptoms could be related to that. have had nerve issues since I was 14. I always attributed the symptoms to anxiety (which I don't actually have apparently.) But I have the whole textbook of MS symptoms.

Adult onset ADHD that does not respond to any treatments. Symptoms are pretty standard with an addition of mood instability. Constant constant fatigue (can't stay awake more than 4 hours) and stimulants do nothing. 

Frequent sudden hearing loss that comes back within an hour or so. No physical issue found in ear. 

**Heres the big one** 

The CT scan on my bladder accidentally caught fat on my liver. My PCP didn't care much and just kept asking me how much I drink (havent since I was 22). So I looked at the report for the CT scan and it showed focal infiltration in the medial segment of the left lobe. It says it was due to a third inflow. My PCP told me it was fine. But now I've learned WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE 3 INFLOWS? So I'm deeply concerned about the focal liver spots around a vein I'm not supposed to have. Is it even fat? 

 I have frequently had poor liver tests with concerning but not enough to look into it levels on ast and stuff. Also popped high for cholesterol a few times which never made sense based on my diet. My eGFR score also randomly dropped from 130 to 86 in 5 months and has just hovered around there ever since. Apparently my kidneys are fine according to my CT scan.

&amp;#x200B;

My other random labs that are always been odd:

BUN stays around 4.

C02 always around 19.

High sodium (I eat a very low sodium diet)

Urine copper always low.

AST, ALT, ALK alternate between being normal and super high.

Lymphs often at the very bottom of normal.

MCH, MCHC both slightly lower than normal range.

WBC bottom of normal. 

ACTH was a few points below normal. Thyroid low end of normal. 

Chloride a few above normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

My swallow study said I presented with ‘functional oropharangyeal swallow’ that currently don’t impair swallowing but with physiological deficits of a neurological etiology. My only complaint was that food sometimes gets stuck at back of my throatI thought the barium Part showed that (absent pharangyeal stripping wave). In this case does the phrase functional oroP swallow imply non-organic? That would be contradictory to the results.

My concern is that in recent discharge papers from a hospitalization, my prior swallow study results were documented as “functional dysphagia” which means non-organic. And amongst a bunch of legit neurological diagnoses, they listed somatoform disorder. I’m wondering if its because of that or due to normal C and T spine scans (I was later diagnosed with neuromuscular scoliosis by a PM&amp;M.

Hi! 

I deal with a lot of ear and sinus related issues, especially when I am sick. I can feel myself coming down with a cold now, and whenever I have a head cold, it’s all nose and ear congestion, and i typically can’t hear out of my ears till the cold goes away and the swelling goes down and they eventually pop. 

Anyway, that aside, I am flying out on May 10th. Airplane rides are never fun for me as I experience a lot more discomfort compared to my family when it comes to take off and landing. 

Is there anything I can do before/during the flight to help equalize my ear pressure? I have tried pinching my nose and blowing gently numerous times to no avail- it doesn’t seem to work 

I see that some people recommend taking a decongestant before you board, but I am not sure if I should use one like Afrin, or Sudafed. Sudafed seems to help a little bit when I am sick, but not right away. Usually I need to take it for 3/4 days before it works. I haven’t ever used Afrin before.

I've been having minor abdominal pain for months but only sought treatment recently due to several months of non-related BPPV vertigo distracting from everything else in my life and cancelling appointments I had. Stupid ear crystals. No more vertigo, just residual dizziness.

More recently I've added periods of horrible nausea, like all day morning sickness some days. The pain is been mildly stabbing (like a hard poke) intermittent pain on my left upper side, usually after meals or in bed. I thought it was my gallbladder, which I've had minor issues with for over a decade, but was never bad enough at the time to take out. Maybe it was actually whatever this scan showed the whole time. I have intermittent tan or red orange stool as well, which also made me wonder gallbladder. 

I had an abdominal CT scan this week, ordered by my surgeon. We have a call next week to discuss with him but I received the results and I always like to research my options so I can ask better questions.

Results:
1. No evidence of internal hernia, which my surgeon had suspected. That at least is a relief.
2. ""Mild hepatomegaly."" ??? 18.9cm craniocaudally
3. ""Reflux of the enteric contrast noted into the hepatobiliary limb to the level of the jejunum, nonspecific finding.""
4. ""Intrauterine contraceptive device noted, transverse limbs of which are oriented in the sagittal plane anteroposteriorly and are not blocking the uterine cornua. Recommend Ob/Gyn consultation.""

I wonder if I'm going to need other tests for the enlarged liver. And whatever might cause the contrast reflux. I can't afford a lot of testing right now, this scan did kill my deductible but there's always coinsurance to pay with any tests. Next month. My budget is shot this month.

And about the IUD, it recommended a consult in the report, is there an immediate issue? I'm overdue for a new IUD but my OBGYN appointment is further down the list. 

I have to pay for whatever tests and visits this abdominal issue needs and 12 sessions of vestibular therapy before I can book more copays for other health issues. Also going to fit my mammogram and colonoscopy in there, they should be free, but there's only so many appointments I can go to in a week. 

If there are any articles you can recommend please let me know. I'm a bit concerned that if it is bile reflux, what I've read so far is there aren't a lot of treatments. One site said lifestyle changes. I'm already implementing so many.

It looks like there is a bulge on it, but I don't know if this is a muscle or not. It's been there for 3 months, I don't think it has grown. When I push into it I can feel a tendon I think. It's like a long tissue that runs along the thigh and I can move it back and forth. The bulge moves with my muscle movements (when I flex my thigh it flexes with it). Also the diameter of this leg is 1cm smaller than the other, so it doesn't seem to be affecting that.

When I trace my femur while applying pressure to the thigh, there aren't any obvious portrusions that can be felt.

It doesn't hurt but I'm scared of osteosarcoma or a soft tissue sarcoma if it is a bulge.

Just one of these could cause a false positive as they conatain dxm, but with all five it was the obvious cause and so we weren't worried. 

The hospital (presumedly) looked at his prescriptions, his otc meds, and the letter written by his doctor, and emailed back saying he would be let in as long as he complied with random drug tests, he agreed and planned to stop taking the meds I mentioned (not the smartest choice but he needed this internship). Thirty minutes later they email back saying that after further review, he will not be let back because robittusin will not cause a false positive and he needs to show a valid prescription containing codeine. They completely ignored all 4 other meds and the length of time he's been on them. 

We don't know what to do, I mean how do you prove that you don't do drugs when they're convinced that u do? There's so many studies that show antihistamines can cause false positives, and robitussin seemed like an obvious cause to me, but they didnt seem to want to believd anything unless it was a prescription.

154,AskDocs,"32F. I just had laparoscopic pelvic excision surgery yesterday (Thursday) for stage 4 Endometriosis. The procedure was 6 hours long. They removed my left ovary, left fallopian tube, my appendix, adhesions from my utersacral ligaments and they shaved a large calcified nodule off my bowels. I had my right ovary suspended, and also had wires inserted into my bladder, where they found IC, and also had polyps removed from inside my uterus. I have 4 incision sites and am currently bleeding from my uterus and bladder. They sent me home the same day. We traveled out of state to see this specialist, so we are currently staying at a hotel and my husband plans to drive us home on Sunday (a 5 hour car ride). I was only given Percocet (325mg) for 3 days post-op pain management, (1 pill every 6 hours) with no refills. I have high pain tolerance but it's barely taking the edge off. In my discharge notes they said I could also take Ibuprofen, but I cannot take any NSAIDs due to a history of stomach ulcers. When the hospital called to check on me, they said they made a mistake, and that I could take Tylenol with Percocet instead. But when I called my surgeon's office, the nurse said I should not mix those medications. This is my second Endo surgery. I had one a few years ago which was less intensive. For that previous recovery I was given Gabapentin and extra strength Tylenol for 2 weeks post op which worked well for me. When I messaged my current surgeon in the patient portal about my pain, the nurse said that they don't want to give me anything else and to just call them back when I run out. But I am concerned that when I run out of pain meds on Sunday, I won't be able to renew my prescription right away due to their office being closed. And I need to get my pain under control for the long ride home. They are a private Catholic practice, so my husband is wondering if they are being weird about medication for religious reasons. I understand that Reddit doctors cannot give specific prescription recommendations, but I just want to know if this post-op pain management plan seem unreasonable, given all the work I had done? Should I be advocating for better pain relief? Or is this normal and I just need to deal with the pain?

155,AskDocs,"Hello,

Will try to be brief. 37M. I bought a house two years ago. At that time, I had high blood pressure 139/95 or so on metroprolol, had IBS, moderate anxiety, GERD, bruxism.

After living here for a year, I had frequent post nasal drip in my master bed, then got covid followed by subacute thyroiditis. Miraculously when the hyperthyroid ohase shifted to euthyroid, it was the best I've felt in my adult life since my early 20s. Started hypo phase and ate plenty of iodine foods trying to get back to feeling good. I over did it and got iodine induced hyperthyroidism. On last ultrasound, my thyroif was hyperemic. No doc has explained well what that means outside of graves. I am negative for antibodies. Developed insomnia, depression, extremely sensitive to smells, hyperacusis.

A couple months after overcoming the second hyperthyroidism, I became sensitive to my bedroom and evacuated. I started to get better on most symptoms and conditions.

I ate moderate amounts of iodine and symptoms all returned, blood pressure now drug free went from 117/69 to 165/120. Again after time it abated.

I began getting weird chills. I developed TMJ disorder. I started sleeping on couch and got better for  little while. Had a basement water issue and here I am.

We found this whole time there was undisclosed attic mold, crawlspace mold. I work at home next to the open crawlspace.

Currently I'm on no drugs, take 5000ius of Vit D a day, magnesium, electrolyte powder. I eat only meat, a few veggies, avocados, plaintains and a few other foods. This keeps gerd, suspected hiatal hernia, ibs at bay. Blood pressure is 120/90 without drugs.

My active symptoms are: bruxism/tmjd, insomnia, severe mood swings, severe anxiety, severe depression, muscle spasms, sleep apnea (went from post nasal drip to completely closing throat), poor nasal breathing.

I just want to feel ""ok"" at this point. How much of this could be mold, or hyperemic thyroid. What can I do? I am getting mold worked on in the house, I just dunno how safe it will be and what studies on mold are real. Anecdotally, many trusted people in my life say they moved from mold and healed. Likely cant move. Thyroid when last checked was in range though tsh was on the higher end of normal 3.5 or so. Normally I used to be 1.3.

I've spent 6k on healthcare trying to figure this out and got nothing but more diagnoses. Docs are giving me zero treatment. Quality of life is poor.

Started swelling this morning with intense naseau. Truthfully though I’m frequently naseaus as I had a distal pancreatomy and splenectomy last year. I had a significant GI bleed at one point so I can’t nsaids 


Been taking gravol and dialudid for pain (I take it when I eat regularly) 

Should I get this checked out or can I leave it till Tuesday when my doctors back in office. 

It doesn’t hurt just swelling and I’m more naseaus than normal. No fever

165,AskDocs,"Hello everyone I hope you’re all okay.
I don’t smoke or drink and have no health problems at all. Although I do have health anxiety.

Basically, I have been experience heart palpitations again kind of like a flutter in my chest or skipping beat as I am going through a stress in my life. My cousin died of a super rare heart problem when we were both just 16 so I think this is where the cardiophobia comes from. Anyway, I had an echo cardio gram on my heart when I was 16 (6 years ago and pretty much every year since I’ve had an ekg) I became anxious 3 years ago and that’s when I first started getting the palpitations since then I’ve had another multiple ekg where they strap the wires and sticky things all over your body and every single test I’ve ever had has been perfect. My most recent one was 6 months ago although I had a panic attack and had palpitations everyday leading up to them my heart was perfect and they went away straight away for 5 months up until last week since getting anxious about my health again. 

I do notice hen I get palpitations in my stress period it’s usually because I’m subconsciously waiting for them or thinking about them and also a bit after I’ve ate some food (not everytime just rarely)

When I’m not in an anxious phase if I get them it’s usually after eating a meal and they happen very rarely to the point where I don’t even take notice. I did make the mistake of googling and watching symptoms and on one of the videos a cardiologist said if they just come on and just disappear they can be a sign of an irregular heartbeat and the person should get tested. I have been tested enough haven’t I ? And also don’t the ekg rule out irregular heart beats?

Now an echo and all these ekg don’t lie do they like there isn’t anything wrong with my heart ? I’ve had my heart listened to wired up and echo and they are all perfect even though the echo was 6 years ago and my most recent ekg was 5 months ago. In my mind I always get anxious and feel like I need more tests. I know it’s not great but I guess I just want someone to tell me about my results and just explain that they are okay and there’s nothing wrong with me just so I can accept them !",t2_3w982096,0,(M22) Anxiety heart palpitations.,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12mienj,True,LetsTalkAboutItBro1,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12mienj/m22_anxiety_heart_palpitations/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12mienj/m22_anxiety_heart_palpitations/,474876,1681516095,0,,False,1681516107,1681516107,2023-04-14 23:48:15,,,

When I try to sleep i notice redness where there was slight pressure on my hand. Sometimes theres slight itching around my body too.

I was told this is not an allergy but autoimmune. I do have hashimotos but my tsh is within range. Even on thyroid meds it makes no difference. Recently I tried sulfasalizine and in the past ive used xolair for over a year, even increasing the dose. My total IgE is high right now at over 700.

Two days ago I encountered some unusual symptoms I haven't had previously for no reason I can think of. My hands were shaky and felt weak. Nothing about that day was different from other days. My activity level, eating, and drinking were all the same as days prior. The shakiness and weakness were my only symptoms, and they lasted from about an hour after I woke up until I went to bed, which would mean this lasted for about 12 hours. When I got home from school, I tried drinking water and having a healthy snack, but it didn't do anything. Yesterday, I felt fine and I my hands weren't shaking at all, but today at the end of my school day my hands once again started to shake. This time, it was more mild. The shaking was a lot less noticeable, but the weakness was still there. The shakiness has gotten slightly worse since then (about 3 hours ago).

Although I said I had no other symptoms, a potentially related issue would be recurring muscle spasms in my legs, but this has been an issue for a few months now and I've thought nothing of it.

I hope this was enough info, but if it wasn't, I'll gladly elaborate. I wasn't too worried about it initially. I was honestly more annoyed than anything because I couldn't play piano without my hands slipping off the keys.

In February, I had a pelvic u/s. I asked for it, to exclude any pelvic issues that could be causing my lower back pain. My ob/gyn dr kindly agreed (she knows I have SEVERE illness anxiety and does what she can to alleviate my anxiousness). Everything was ""remarkable."" I was on CD 19 of my cycle. When gyn messaged about 10 days later stating all was fine and the ""thickened lining was because I was just about to start my period"" I mentioned that I had missed it (that's been happening more within the last year-more erratic but no difference in flow). It ended up coming on CD 45. She then stated she wanted to do a D&amp;C and polypectomy   (She suspects polyps). I usually have fairly normal cycles (23-26 days) with the occasional long or short one thrown in after every 4 or 5 normal cycles. Is 12 mm way too thick on CD 19? I obviously had NOT yet ovulated since my period didn't start for 26 more days. Im really worried about the biopsy. 

Background: 
I have an infertility diagnosis of POF. Had my first and only child 38, in 2019. Missed miscarriage in 2018. D&amp;C performed to remove. Saline pelvic ultrasound in 2018 (before pregnancy with daughter) Hysteroscopy and resection for retained products of conception. Pregnant with my daughter the next cycle. 

History of HPV and cervical dysplasia in my 20s but not since then. 

Hormones (including AMH) tested in 2018 and this past summer correlate with perimenopause and very low AFC (3 follicles back in '18).

196,AskDocs,"Non smoker, non drinker, generally good health.

I had an open left inguinal hernia reduction two years ago. I've never really been pain free in the area (inside, not in the skin/surface). I went to see the surgeon about 9 months after the surgery because it can hurt pretty bad sometimes. He did the ""turn your head and cough"" thing and said everything looked fine and ""sometimes pain just happens after being cut open."" Fair enough?

Fast forward, it still hurts. Sometimes it goes away, but it's almost always there a bit. In the last few weeks it's been pretty bad and consistent. I don't understand why it would be getting worse (in both pain and frequency) after this long. Sometimes the pain radiates down into my groin which is no fun 

So here are the questions:
1. Any guesses on what could be wrong?
2. Is there any way to tell exactly what's wrong without surgery? I can't really afford an MRI right now but if that's something that could shed some light on this I could plan for it soon.
3. Even if the issue is discovered, I would assume it would likely mean getting surgery again, right?

23M normal bmi no underlying conditions, vaped a few years so far

I have had a lesion or patch of erythema on my left bucal mucosa for about 3 and a half months now (comes and goes, comes after stopping oral steroid, goes when on it). First seen by a dentist twice who said it wasn't of concern but it persisted so I saw an ENT who also had no concerns but gave me kenalog to try. It got rid of the patch but after stopping comes back. I saw them again after it got more red and they said to go back on it. Went back on kenalog and it pretty much faded entirely as you see in the pictures. I saw an oral surgeon just for their thoughts and they believe it to be just trauma that is taking a while to heal or possibly lichen. I saw my ent last week who said to stop the kenalog as it healed but since last week it is again reappearing. All believe it is trauma but i can't convince myself it's nothing aside malignancy. 

Is it time to push for a biopsy?
Should I prepare myself for some very bad news?
Does something malignant in this location come and go, responding to steroid?
It is starting to come back as I feel the rough patch in the last photo
The pictures go in order of longest ago to most recent (today) at bottom:

I tried to help her research this and whenever i google facial warts it says its from hpv. Also, sites like webmd and nhs uk say you can get warts from (apart from sexual) someone else with warts by coming in non sexual contact with them or from surfaces with the germs. However i thought the main consensus on hpv spread was thought to be sexual? I have a few questions if anyone can help clear it up:

1) can you get facial warts from someone else with warts through non sexual contact (per webmd and nhs page) or is it sexual contact only?

2) if you can get facial warts through non sexual contact do you get hpv as well?

3) if number two is true wouldnt that mean  hpv transmission isnt just through sexual contact? (I thought sexual contact was how it was established to be transmitted)

All of my toes looked normal except one, which was completely straight while the others were relaxed. I was able to curl it on my own, but it felt like it was locked a bit.

Since September, I've been having twitching in my right leg and foot and extremely mild weakness. Combined with intermittent bladder hesitancy, I finally had an MRI on my lumbar spine. I'm currently a college student doing a study abroad so my MRI results are in Spanish. Translated from Google the results are:

 Findings: 

Rectification of lumbar lordosis in the sagittal plane. Alterations in the morphology of the L4 vertebral body at the level of the anterior region of the upper vertebral endplate. Signs of degenerative disc disease in L2/L3 in L3/L4. Disc overflow in L2/L3 in L3/ L4. Slight decrease in the amplitude of the lateral recesses in L4/L5 and L5/S1. The spinal canal and mention are normal. We identified alterations at the level of the roots of the cauda equina.

 Conclusion: 

Signs of degenerative disc disease in L2/L3 in L3/L4. Disk spillage in L2/L3 in L3/L4. Alterations in the morphology of the L4 vertebral body at the level of the anterior region of the upper vertebral plate.

I do have anxiety of all types, especially health related anxiety.

Last night and today I have been having an achy pain in my upper back on both sides. When I breathe in deeply I feel pain in my upper right quadrant kind of just on the side, and there's a spot on my right belly that it hurts if I push. A few weeks ago I felt like I was getting a UTI but we got a blizzard that weekend so I got a big bottle of cranberry juice and after the weekend I felt ok so I didn't go to the Dr. I have never had a kidney infection before but I have had a handful of UTIs before, one had kind of weird symptoms that I didn't notice. I do not have a fever. I have had more general aches and pains in my abdomen/pelvis than usual, but I've weaned off any pain management due to improving symptoms so I assumed I was just feeling more than usual. 

I already have a Dr appt scheduled with my primary provider for my thyroid checkup Monday. Can I wait until then to be evaluated safely? What symptoms should I go to urgent care for rather than waiting?

Throwaway account. Not sure if this is the best place for this or not but giving it a try since it is wound related.

I've been chronically picking my nose for months now. I've always picked, but I overdid it once, which caused a bad reaction, causing me to pick more because of it, and the cycle continues. It's become extremely concerning as I think I really am hurting myself now. Ashamed to say, I think I have a small divot inside the nostrils now from not letting the skin heal properly. Trying to look inside my nose, it's very red/swollen/irritated, mixed with dry yellow mucus/snot (which I'm hoping isn't infection, but there's no smell).

I know I need to stop, and I'm looking into and trying different methods. But one of the reasons I can't seem to stop is because of the scabs/pain and over producing crusty snot. It's sore, uncomfortable, sometimes painful, and I can't seem to stop myself from the relief of ridding myself of scabbing/hard snot. I do it both intentionally, unable to stop, and do it without noticing. But of course, this just makes it worse. I also can't help but like...flare my nostrils, because it feels stiff in there you know? But that just makes me notice the pain.

I've tried using some nasal gel to lubricate my nose (secaris), because it seemed incredibly dry (and causing the extra crusty mucus). But it doesn't help very much, still feels quite dry. Is there anything I can do while I'm trying to stop this habit to help heal my nose and take some of the pain away? I do very much think it will be easier to quit if I don't have a constant irritant. (very much constant, it always feels off). It's a bad habit I've always had, but it's what is currently going on in there that has made me have a non stop habit. If I need to see my doctor, is there anything I should say or ask for if you have any recommendations?

Yes, I am ashamed of this and find it gross, and even dangerous. I really do want to quit and I hope someone here has any advice. If you have advice for the quitting part as well I'll happily hear you out!

I also recently got a cpap machine. The nose pillows were the best for me after trying some, but of course this makes it hard to wear, the dryness (even with humidifier) makes my nose sore overnight as well.",t2_98qii3a5t,0,Nose Picking - Now has wounds inside nose,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12mfirw,True,meanwhileamused,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12mfirw/nose_picking_now_has_wounds_inside_nose/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12mfirw/nose_picking_now_has_wounds_inside_nose/,474860,1681510338,0,,False,1681510358,1681510359,2023-04-14 22:12:18,,,

Hey all, 

Over the past couple of months I have noticed my left hand has been more shaky. It doesn’t interfere with any daily tasks and there’s no weakness, but it seems shakier than before. My right seems to not shake as much, but also shakes. My fingers don’t shake in normal daily activities but only when I do the movement in the video.

I’m a overweight 20 year old guy and have had this dull ache in my testicles for the last lil bit, it started as a come and go thing but has slowly gotten stronger and happening more and more often. Due to the prolonged aching and the fact that sex with my gf has been normal as far as my ejaculation I assume it’s not torsion or anything but what the hell could be causing it and how can I help it? The only thing that happened recently is my girl accidentally kneeled onto my groin while climbing into bed a few nights ago but the pain was still there before that, and I’m not sure if that’s what made it more severe or not.

My sister is 35, mostly nonverbal, and developmentally delayed. I am home for the first time in almost two years and have learned she has had this rash on her foot for almost a year. I’ve included a link to the pictures my sister tolerated me taking. She is usually very sweet, but she began to whine and get very upset when I went to help her take her shoes off. This is how I found out something has been wrong with her foot. Here is everything I’ve learned from my mother: 

-Rash first presented last June/July. My mother thought it was athlete’s foot from the gym when she took my sister to the pool for her PT. It apparently itched so badly in the beginning that my sister scratched off parts of her skin. I can’t tell what is active rash and what is scar tissue. My sister is very pale and easily develops very dark scars.

-My mother applied lotrimin twice a day for 30 days and all it seemed to do was leave her skin irritated and raw in some places. My sister hated it and would  say “hot” so I’m assuming it burned. 

-My mother then took her to her PCP in August. Apparently he looked at it from 4 feet away, said it must be some kind of staph, and prescribed sulfamethoxazole 800 mg-trimethoprim 160 mg tablet and itraconazole 100 mg capsule. My sister took the medications as prescribed and they didn’t have an effect on the rash. 

-The rash hasn’t spread to anywhere else on her. My mother says it has stayed roughly the same shape. She says my sister occasionally scratches and fixates on it, so maybe it only occasionally itches now. 

-Her damaged toenails are not a result of whatever this rash is. My sister has unfortunately peeled and picked at her toenails for the majority of her life. 

I’ve made an appointment for her to see her doctor again, but can’t get her in until 3 weeks from now.

I’ve seen the doctor about abdominal pain while not on my period and she adjusted the way I’ve been taking my birth control pill that was originally prescribed for painful periods. It hasn’t helped and I keep getting random cramping really low down in my belly or like behind my pubic area to the point I often need to stop what I’m doing and sit down. I don’t know if it’s the pill that’s doing this but before I was on the pill my periods were so incredibly bad I’d have to take a week off school every month.

Another thing is that my breasts seem to keep growing which I get can be normal for my age but they’re really big in comparison to my frame so I need physio for my neck and back (isn’t helping much). As in my cup size is nearly half way down the alphabet. I’m aware I’m a little overweight but I’m not gaining weight - if anything I see to be loosing weight but they’re still increasing a cup size every couple months. I started puberty fairly early started period at 10 and had developed breasts at 8-9 too.

My physio suggested it could be a hormonal problem but she didn’t feel qualified to comment further on things. This was because the amount of strain my breasts cause as in it’s not normal their size. Also again I know my bmi puts me at overweight but even doctors seem shocked at this because I’m a uk size 12 us 8 so not skinny but not fat?

I’ve been sick recently too with lower chest infections which they took my bloods for because my heart rate and blood pressure was high - all that came out abnormal was a high platelet count which they said was due to the infection but to check it again in six weeks time which would be next week now. Would these blood tests have picked up on it if there was anything wrong with my hormones or is it something I should raise with my doctor? I also had a round of amoxicillin which didn’t work then doxycycline if that’s relevant.

I’ve also googled about thyroid problems and I seem to fit a lot of the symptoms. I don’t like self diagnosing etc but yeah.

My anxiety’s also been worse lately so that could just be me paranoid about my health but at the same time I’m fed up and in pain.

I eat a lot but I’m losing weight too.

23m, white 190 lbs,  asthma, depression, gad, panic disorder. Propranolol 20 mg/d (not needed it since started steroids), diazepam 10 mg/d, 40 mg/d prednisone, nebulised albuterol/ipratropium every 4 hours

Ican't afford steroid inhaler,, I am taking 40 mg/d prednisone again for 5 days but found some methylprednisolone and took that for two days before. I am continuing having wheezing but nebulised albuterol or duoneb alone is not nearly enough to stop an attack alone without the oral steroids. Singular gave me depression, biological are ridiculously expensive (my insurance pays nothing till hit 15,000). Not sure what asthma I have, sometimes exercise, randomly, cold air,  rarley allergies but Im not even sure about allergic asthma, antihistamines are useless for me. Not even sure what's causing this exacerbation. 

Anyways, my mood is better, libidos back, I don't have a pounding heart/tachycardia while standing or after eating, I have energy, an appetite (which I lost a few around christmas- I've lost over 50 pounds from the lack of appetite). Little more anxious but manageable, depression is gone (and Im not bipolar or having a hypomanic epidsode from the steroids I just feel normal).My BP for some reason isn't as high too. 

So far this exacerbation has been all day and all night without the steroids, inhaler only took it from probably life threatening to not life threatening. I was in the er for it, got steroids, and it came back right after finished. Went to urgent care and more steroids. It is almost totally gone, albiet cough is painful still. I don't care about side effects, the dose would be lowered as needed I believe with PO steroids for asthma.

I am aware of the side effects that steroids have, I know they can be quite severe. I haven't noticed any other than mild trouble sleeping, increased appetite but really its back to normal. Blood glucose is normal, no water retention. I read every other day dosing can help with adrenal suppression, and doses as low as 7.5 mg may be enough. I don't want inhaled ones because of the improvement of other problems.

A constant stench, it is enough to breathe to make all the people cough inside a shop, a room, at school, etc.

I have been to 4 ENTs, 2 gastroenterologists, 2 dentists. Nobody finds the cause.

The ENT, In addition to the bb I also had other problems (apnea, sore throat, low hearing) subjected me to septoturbinoplasty and adenotonsillectomy. I solved all the problems but not the bad breath.

The gastroenterologist gave me a gastroscopy. Antral gastritis and gastroesophageal reflux.

Dentist removed my wisdom teeth. 

I do not know what to say. Some research claims that the problem is bacteria in the intestines that ferment food, the gases are exchanged with the blood and then the lungs and breath 

Does this make sense? What should I do?

I can't live like this anymore. I can not do it.

265,AskDocs,"I've had two thyroid tests done this year because I'm sick of feeling like this. 

(Link to screenshots of lab results in comments)

My most bothersome symptoms seem to get worse after 2-3pm and include:

• Lethargic and unmotivated, struggle to get things done

• Tired all the time/trouble waking up (usually sleep 10+ hours if undisturbed)

• Brain fog, problems concentrating, and short term memory problems (the one that bothers me most)

• Almost daily anxiety (a constant painful squeezing in my chest, occasionally heart palpitations/the feeling of my heart beating too hard)

• A slow but steady increase in my weight despite not changing my diet

• My hands and feet (and sometimes full body) are seemingly always excessively cold and take a long time to warm up with socks/heating blankets/etc. 

Also, I'm not sure if it's related but I'll sometimes (but rarely) be sitting still and have a moment where it feels like the room spins and my vision darkens. It ends as quickly as it comes on. 

There are other things that I'm unsure of being hypo symptoms or symptoms of other issues/nonissues.

I took my first test Feb 5th, and my second test yesterday, April 13th. I took both tests within an hour of each other, 7:30 - 8:30am and both tests were done by the same lab.

The first test showed a TSH of 6.020, and a free T4 of 1.08. The second test a TSH of 4.99 and a free T4 of 0.95. 

I've had a good few weeks over the 2 month period where my anxiety was lessened, but recently I've started to feel worse again. The feeling of getting worse is almost like feeling a cold coming on.

I had a vertical sleeve gastrectomy about 3 years ago and haven't been great at taking my vitamins, so I'm sure there is some deficiency. I took my recommended vitamins consistently for the first 3 weeks or so after my first test, but haven't since, so I'm unsure if it really had any impact on my thyroid panel results. 

With all of that said, I want to know what is your interpretation of the lab results? And what should my steps be in terms of seeking treatment or trying to manage it at home.

Since about two or three months I've been getting very intense stomach and back pains every few days, some days even every few hours and I have no idea why could that happen.
I feel like both stomach pain and back pain happen simultaneously, the location of stomach pain is always upper stomach just under ribs usually on one of either sides or somehow behind sternum, the back pain feels impossible to localize well, sometimes it's between my shoulder blades, sometimes it's in my loins, but when I have an intense pain attack (when I feel like I can't take a breath for  a second during the most intense time of my cramp) it feels like I get cramps in many places at once, usually with one place being the dominant one. Usually during those pain attacks I can't walk, talk and every smallest move makes the pain worse. I feel sick and lightheaded from the pain. 
They go away after around half an hour usually.
I don't know if it's an important information but my back aches during the day, but much less and it doesn't interfere much with my daily activities. Same thing with stomach pain but it happens less often than the back pain. 
I don't think the cause of this problem might be anything related to food, hunger or stomach hyperacidity, because it happens whether I'm hungry or not. 
I feel like any OTC medication like painkillers or antispasmodics has never done anything to actually ease the pain, usually I had to wait it out until it passed. Only thing that helps me a bit is trying to find a position when it hurts the least, usually laying down curled in a ball, and hot water bottle, but it never makes it go away. 
Does anyone has an idea what could that be?

Primary complaint: dull ache in upper right quadrant that radiates to upper right back and arm. Also feelings of fullness in upper abdomen (as if someone stuck some eggs under my rib cage), as well as general abdominal distension. These symptoms are present 24/7, though the intensity of the pain varies. The worst part is the overall discomfort I am constantly in. Can't wear most of my clothes, also have a hard time telling how hungry/full I am. 

Current Medications: Sucralfate (just started after endoscopy found some inflammation in my stomach).  Hyoscyamine (was prescribed when addressing constipation with my GI doc and I was explaining how much discomfort I'm in. 

Other info: never smoker; drink very occasionally (1-2 drinks about once/month); no recreational drugs

History: In June I gave birth to my son, soon afterwards developed horrible diarrhea. Ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with UC. Was put on prednisone and then mesalamine. Also utilized a functional medicine approach and am taking supplements and using the specific carbohydrate diet and this seems under control. Symptoms referenced above slowly came on Fall 2022 and worsened as time went on. Had my gallbladder removed in March due to biliary dyskinesia, however my symptoms were not resolved. Had a CT scan and MRCP and only findings were constipation, which was a surprise to me because I was going regularly and my stools were on the softer side, but apparently I was super backed up. Treated the constipation, even did quite a full clean out with magnesium citrate, but my symptoms persist. My husband is a chiropractor so I have access to his X-ray machine.

I woke up a week ago in pain, feeling like I had trapped gas, so I did “yoga poses” that the internet said helps with this stuff. I also took gas-x and some senna. Next day I had two small bowel movements. As the days progressed, I kept taking laxatives while noticing a certain part in my rectum that would cause a lot of pain when watery stool would pass. I gave myself a gloved exam but couldn’t feel any mass, just the rectum itself seemed to hurt, but my finger could only reach in like 3 inches. I did an enema yesterday but could only hold it 5 mins before violently making bowel movements for the next hour. Last night/today I didn’t take any laxatives to give myself a break but the pain is still there and I can’t poop. 

Anyways from my internet research (although I don’t know what my diagnosis is) it seems like fecal impaction, hemorrhoids, and whatnot can be treated at home.

280,AskDocs," ***- 3 years ago the following happened, in the following order:***

1. Some rash on right hand, spread from pinky to the other fingers.
2. Docs just prescribed Flucloxacillin, took 4 pills everyday for 2 weeks as prescribed.
3. Rash went away.
4. Then i had 3-4 weeks of moderate-severe headaches + occasional right eye pain.
5. After the weeks were over, i woke up one day with tinnitus and had it since.

***- Within the next few weeks, the following occurred***

1. I still had occasional headaches but they weren't that bad and as time passed i rarely got headaches.
2. Developed **gradually** hearing sensitivity (hyperacusis), which i still have to this day.
3. Developed eye floaters, which i still have to this day.

***- Between then and now:***

Tinnitus level would sometimes change, but mostly it was somewhat mild but it can be affected by me bending my neck for too long, or putting too much pressure on side of head when im sleeping, which can cause tinnitus to spike like ""EEEEEEE"" and to relieve it, id stand up with straight neck/posture.

***- 1 week ago, at 5-6th of April, the following occured:***

went to bed, tried sleeping but tinnitus spiked as i were laying straight against the bad without pillows behind head, and i felt pressure behind my head on the left side of head, which stuck around.

The Tinnitus spike ""EEEEE"" also persisted for longer than ive ever experienced before, so i panicked a bit. But after straightening my neck/posture it slowly... went back down to normal but tinnitus became very reactive and more intrusive, as with the slightest movement of the neck, it would spike the tinnitus. My neck also felt stiff/tense. Hearing sensitivity became way more sensitive.

Later on my face/head/forehead/eyebrows all felt quite stiff/tense to move, like moving my eyebrows, or cheeks, it all felt a bit more tense/stiff.

***- After this day, i still have the following:***

* Tense/somewhat stiff neck throughout most of the day, but sometimes it changes in tension/stiffness.
* Tense/somewhat stiffer feeling facial muscles when moving them, like moving eyebrows, cheeks, ears, etc.
* Sometimes i feel pressure behind my head, that can be either left or right side of head.
* Tinnitus
* Hearing sensitivity
* Eye floaters and on rare occasions eye flashes

I'm really curious if anyone can tell me what i could possibly have lmao, good luck to any doctors reading this.

It should be a good thing that I’m not in pain, but I’m a little worried because what I’m experiencing is so vastly different from what I was told to expect.

I did have an enormous calf cramp in the leg that got the PRP last night, and I’m not sure what that was about because I haven’t had any calf cramps since I was in my leg brace after surgery.

So for about two years now, I’ve had the most annoying issues with my chest and ribcage. I have on-and-off pains pretty much all throughout the day. My blood pressure is high sometimes but runs in the family; however, my doctor ruled out heart issues through an ECG and chest X-ray; I’m still not convinced. He did say angina and heart issues are usually caused by exertion, and mine are pretty much all the time, more often than not when I’m actually sitting around doing nothing and don’t get out of breath easily when exercising.

The pains I get come in all different shapes and sizes; sometimes I get ribcage pain that hurts to touch; this can happen anywhere; a lot of the time the ribs are just by my armpit; sometimes it feels in the center of my chest; there’s also a great deal of discomfort in the center of my chest; it’s kind of crushing, but it’s hard to explain.

I’ve looked at costodontritis (spelling), but it doesn’t quite add up to what I have, I believe.

Anyone have any thoughts as to what could be causing this all day, every day?

I’ve been taking TRT as prescribed by my doctor for 4 weeks. I know these two things can be related to alcohol and other meds. None of the meds I take are on the list besides Aleve and BC Powder that could have skewed my results bc I did take some a day or two before.

My new Test shows
AST 228
ATL 118
Bilirubin 0.5
Alkaline Phosphate 75

I have been exercising more but it’s mostly walking/jogging if that makes a difference.


I just took another test after TRT and I’m not sure what’s happening besides that my drinking habits may have mixed in with something? I was drinking pretty heavily, liquor from about 2018-2021. I still drink. I would say about on a weeks average a bottle or two of vodka, not the one with the handle.

After I got these results back, it was like a scared straight moment and I immediately have no desire to continue drinking at all and have not for a few days already and don’t miss it one bit.

After they released her she can now eat and she is eating.

But she sleeps a lot during the day to gather her strength from the ordeal.

And the pills she takes make her sleepy.

This would not be a problem except with her sleeping so much during the day she has trouble sleeping during the night.

This is how my scratch looked yesterday when I got it: https://ibb.co/0VKBcSM

Today I went to the ER to get my tetanus shot, just to be safe.


The doc who gave me the shot was antivaxx (at least with the covid one). He asked me if I had a vaccine before, and I told him I had the covid one. He said that I shouldn't have done that, and told me, while showing me that the tetanus one, that this one will protect me and actually do something.

When I asked how long does this vaccine last, he told me 6 months and that for a longer period you need multiple vaccines. But all the internet says that a vaccine lasts 5-10 years, there is none which lasts only 6 months.

Now I am a bit worried he didn't actually give me a vaccine (he seemed quite confident about the normal ones though, only seemed to have a problem with covid ones) or that he gave me a wrong one.

321,AskDocs,"Hi there. I'm 28F 5'8"" 160lbs white, and generally very healthy and active. I have no major medical conditions, good nutrition, don't drink alcohol, workout several times per week (yoga, lifting, indoor climbing). I take hormonal BC to avoid painful periods (been on it for more than a year) and I started taking a long-term antibiotic for a skin issue a week ago (yes I'm aware they interfere).

I've noticed that almost every day while sleeping lately, I wake up at some point with some of my fingers numb and prickly up to my entire arm being limp (where it flops around, can't move it, and have to ""shake it back to life"" so to speak). I remember this happening occasionally as a kid, as well, so it's not a new development. I take several work trips per year that involve flights and I tend to get a similar problem sometimes when using the armrests in planes.

I'd say it mostly happens in my right arm (dominant) but I think it happens in the left arm sometimes, as well. I'm a bit alarmed that this seems to be happening so often. I'm guessing my brain wakes me up when this starts to happen so it can't be that long that it happens but I can't be sure, obviously. I'm just concerned that it may at some point cause damage if this keeps happening.

I have a memory foam type of mattress, so I'm wondering if a different type of mattress would help? A side sleeping pillow? Maybe it could somehow be nutrition related?

I have no health insurance. I'm wondering what the best route to take is at this point…who do I need to go see? What type of doctor what type of medical facility could

337,AskDocs,"I'm 35F and about 150 lbs, 5' 3"".  I do not smoke and only have a very occasional glass of wine, otherwise sober.  I take an 81mg aspirin 3x a week due to a POF found during a bubble study.

This used to be occasional but now is happening like 6 out of 7 nights a week- gasping palpitations when I'm falling asleep.  When I lay in bed at night, as I'm trying to fall asleep for the night, I will be awoken by a palpitation/sucking in air like my life depended on it. Sometimes they are mild, sometimes they are strong enough to make me jolt up in bed and gasp for air for like 5 seconds.  Some nights it only happens once, others a handful of times before I fall asleep.  This ONLY happens in this stage of the night (twilight sleep/falling asleep) and no other times, and has never woken me up in the middle of the night.

So last year I went to the cardiologist for this and she did the whole battery of tests- stress test, echocardiogram (how the POF was found), CT angiogram, two week wearable holter monitor.  All came back A-Ok.  She said I had some PVCs but they were in the normal percentage amount per day.  I again explained, what about these episodes I have? She said sometimes as we're falling asleep when our heart slows down our beats get a little wonky and some extras sneak in, and not to worry about it.

I am worried about it, lol.  Could this be sleep apnea, like stopping breathing?  I don't snore or sleep with my mouth open.  

Two things that could be of note: On one night that I did indulge in a rather large glass of wine, I had EXTREME episodes of this trying to sleep.  It was the only time this happened \~10 times before I could fall asleep. My heart was flopping all over the place and I couldn't catch my breath. (This is mostly the reason I don't drink at all anymore.) Two, this has only started since after having COVID last year and I'm 99% sure this is related because I've never had this before in my life.

I don't really want to go back to my cardiologist about this because they've already run all the tests.  Is it worth mentioning it to my PCP about sleep apnea?",t2_9bkth,0,Sleep apnea?

72 year old female, long history of generalized anxiety disorder, no other medical problems. Non- smoker, social drinker, no recreational drugs. 

I’ve been prescribed Zoloft 100mg daily for a number of years. Was previously on citalopram but switched to Zoloft because of concerns about cardiac issues in the elderly. 

The Zoloft is causing almost daily severe diarrhea to the point that OTC anti diarrhea meds are ineffective. The urgency is so severe that I’m becoming incontinent of stool, to my mortification. I’ve decreased the dosage to 50mg, which is somewhat better, but I still dread leaving the house for fear of soiling myself.  I’m leaking stool almost constantly. My doctor switched me temporarily to Cymbalta in an attempt to mitigate the diarrhea but I saw no improvement, although admittedly I didn’t try it that long. 

I’m becoming quite desperate. My anxiety is getting worse because I’ve had to decrease my Zoloft but the diarrhea is out of control. My MD is generally great but she’s no expert on psych meds - she had to look up alternatives on line in front of me when we discussed the diarrhea. (No shame in that, I’d rather she do research).

347,AskDocs,"Im a 39 yr old Caucasian Male, 6foot 1in, Current weight is 360lbs, Currently on Metformin, Atorvastatin, and Lisinopril. Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and GERD

Was having chest pains randomly for the last few years, Started in 2021 after getting bacterial pneumonia. I had chest pains and shortness of breath, was taken by ambulance to the closest ER, they did EKG and Chest Xray (no bloodwork) and said nothing appeared wrong and it probably was just anxiety and sent me home. (cant find results for EKG with them, doesnt look like they keep that record)

Still having same symptoms days later i went to another hospitals ER that was a little further away but more trusted. They did Aspirin, Nitro, and did EKG, Chest Xray, Blood work, and CT with Contrast. Looking at CT they show no blockages but did notice some clouding in one of my lungs (Bacterial Pneumonia) I did not notice the notes in the EKG back then, but when i look them up they noted: Left anterior fascicular block, Inferior infarct , age undetermined. however the ER doctor never mentioned anything, although Troponin levels looked normal.

Followed up with my primary after a week on antibiotics, things looked good. However i would still get random chest pain for a while, sometimes some arm numbness and pain with it, Primary did an EKG for this in 2022, They noted it looks ok However the EKG did note a left axis deviation, along with Cannot rule out Inferior infarct , age undetermined., Dr believed that I probably had GERD so i would take omeprazole. This didnt seem to help and i felt a bit dizzy after taking it, so i stopped

went to the ER a few more times when this would happen, CT would come back clean, I also only noticed the EKG from the ER in 2022 that noted the same left axis deviate and cannot rule out inferior infarct.

After happening again and going to the ER, with very high blood pressure (230/125) I talked to my Dr, was put on Lisinopril and asked finally decided to get a stress test, results came back, waiting on my Dr, however it will be a few days as she is on vacation.


The results appear to also mention that it appears there was a prior infarction,

&gt; The patient's baseline EKG demonstrates a sinus rhythm with poor R wave progression across the precordium. With stress there are no significant ST changes consistent with ischemia. On review of the patient's nonattenuation corrected stress imaging there is a mild defect involving the basal inferolateral wall which has extension into the mid portion where it moves more inferiorly. The patient's rest imaging demonstrates a similar area of defect though of greater intensity. The addition of attenuation corrected imaging does not significantly improve the appearance of this defect. It remains present on stress imaging and continues to appear worse on rest imaging in comparison to stress imaging. Rest attenuation corrected imaging is further impacted by significant adjacent counts along the inferior wall
&gt; which limit interpretability. Wall motion in this area does not have a normal appearance. It may be secondary to excessive loss of counts. Global LV function is normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 67% and an end-systolic volume of 32 mL.
&gt; 
&gt; Interpretation:    
&gt; 1) Adequate workload achieved based on heart rate.    
&gt; 2) The functional capacity is reduced demonstrated for age.    
&gt; 3) The patient experienced 3/10 chest tightness with treadmill testing.    
&gt; 4) The EKG was negative for ST segment depression.    
&gt; 5) normal blood pressure response with exercise.    
&gt; 6) The perfusion scan demonstrates no clear evidence of ischemia. There is an area of possible prior infarction involving the basal inferolateral and mid inferolateral wall. This defect appears worse in rest than in stress but otherwise has a fixed appearance. Wall motion in the area as noted above does not appear normal increasing the likelihood that this represents prior infarction instead of artifactual change.     
&gt; 7) The gated wall motion is abnormal as noted above. The overall ventricular function is normal.
&gt; 

Now what im getting from these results is i had an infarction in the past but currently things seem ok however there are some defects.

will note that i had an EKG in 2018 and it was completely normal, so the abnormal one in 2021, makes it sound like something might have happened during 2021, 

Im wondering what questions i should ask my doctor. when i do a follow up here soon. 

Also anything i should be doing right now as this just causes me alot of anxiety.

Could this have been from back when i had Pneumonia (also was going through a bit of emotional distress due to a break up a few weeks prior) and would have this been caught earlier if the first hospital did a test for troponin levels",t2_cw0y7,0,"Possible prior infarction, questions on what to ask doctor and what i should do",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12magjv,True,jjjacer,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12magjv/possible_prior_infarction_questions_on_what_to/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12magjv/possible_prior_infarction_questions_on_what_to/,474847,1681500990,0,,False,1681501006,1681501007,2023-04-14 19:36:30,,,

Last night I was having chest pressure, a bad headache, and my head kept feeling like it was underwater but then it would all go away.

I laid on the couch and my heart started beating hard and I felt weak all over. I told my husband to call me, but I started gaining consciousness again when my mom called me about 15-20 minutes later.

It took a while for me to start thinking clearly and be myself again. I felt ""slow"" and couldn't keep up with anyone talking and still felt weak like I didn't have the strength to talk.

As the title says. I always have issues when I travel to a tropical climate, I'll get heat rashes even if I'm wearing loose fitting clean clothes that's breathable. I'm in a place where it's not even that hot but it is humid and I'm not sweating, had a loofa scrub wash every day and still developed it, and also there is no air conditioning in this place so I'm exposed to high humidity 24/7.

Since heat rash is about clogged pores, I wondered if using Salicylic acid body wash would help prevent heat rash? Prevention is the best way to curb this.

So that when I travelled to these hot and humid places, my routine would be

* Warm (not hot) water Salicylic acid body wash every day with a loofa to exfoliate
* emollient or aloe vera gel for moisturizing

I keep getting very swollen/painful lymph nodes under my arms ONLY 4 days or so before I get my period. 
I have a copper IUD that is fairly recent (under 1 year) 
I had type 4 precancerous cells on my cervix but after a leep and testing I've been cleared of HPV(and odd cells) and now will just have regular screening. 
I have had a breast reduction when I was 18. I am 26 With nerve damage. Lately they are more sensitive and even swelling before my period which hadn't happened before. 
Swelling stays for a day or two after I get my period and then goes down and stops being a painful. It was just my right underarm lymph node and now it's both underarms. 
Should I be worried? I am currently looking for a new Dr. as mine moved clinics.

380,AskDocs,"29 Male with history of panic attacks from 4 years ago; took meds for a year.  Panic attacks had stopped.

This is a the long post:

Started developing stomach cramps and twitching on left side of stomach a month ago. Usually after eating or drinking anything. Was too stressed at work. Ignored the symptoms.

Experienced sharp pain towards the left of the heart for 5 seconds a week ago, just sitting in office, without any stress. Was very anxious the next day thinking about the pain. Went to ER 24 hours after the pain. ECG was normal. Troponin I less than 1.5. ER doc said everything is normal and recommended visiting OPD at the next appointment. I felt fine in an hour, without any meds. I think I just had a panic attack here.

Went to cardiologist two days later (had forgotten about the stomach pains when I went to this doctor). Treadmill test normal. Doctor said no need to see cardiologist and I can resume workout. During TMT I felt minor pain towards the left ribs. Went for a jog later in the evening and the minor pain shifted behind the left knee. It shifted again behind the right knee a few hours later.

Started feeling very anxious and started taking Etizola 0.25 once a day (this was given to me by my psychiatrist 2 years ago as emergency meds).

Went to a general physician the next day, remembered to tell him about the stomach pain. Showed all medical history. The stomach pain now was less frequent but still painful after meals. Three day course completed for meds OFLOKEM 200, Dicyclomine Hydrochloride &amp; Paracetamol tablets. Stomach pain completely gone. But the random minor pain all over the body still remained. 

Now I just have these minor pains shifting all over the body and this is making me very anxious. Usually at only one place at a time. Places of pain - Left side neck, thigh, pinky toe of either legs, towards the left of the heart, towards right ribs, either hands.

Noticed that I am unrinating less frequently. No urge to urinate after walking up.

Went to another general physician after the above course was complete (because the last physician was not available). Showed all medical history. He said to ignore the random minor pains. Recommended to see a psychiatrist for correct anxiety medicine dose. Recommended against any blood tests. Said nothing will be there. Prescribed Syrup SUCRALCOAT, Tab TRYPTOMER 10 mg for 15 days. Mentioned that we can think about stomach endoscopy after 15 days. 

I plan to follow the prescribed meds and see my psychiatrist tomorrow. But the doctors saying that the random pain is nothing to worry about is making me anxious. I don't like not knowing the cause. The pain reminds me of its existence every few minutes and keeps me worried.

From the symptoms, I think there's a minor GI bleeding in my stomach from may be an ulcer. But don't know if any of the doctors see it this way.

382,AskDocs,"Today is Friday, on Sunday I over ate due to Easter dinner. Monday I felt fine, went to work as normal. Late Monday was having grumblings in my stomach but no bowel movement. Tuesday developed abdominal pain, felt really gassy, and had a bowel movement before work. Throughout work the pain continued, the grumblings of gas also. Multiple bowel movements Tuesday, nothing solid, mostly soft mushy, not quite liquid. Associated with the movement was lots of foul gas. Possibly had 3-5 movements Tuesday after 11 AM. Wednesday still had pain, came on and off but the gaseous grumblings remained. Multiple other liquify bowel movements with heavy gas during the movement. One bowel movement had a solid towards the end, with it was slight mucus and blood. I associated this with pushing very hard. Thursday I started to feel better. Was taking Pepto to help and focused on eating fibers and healthy foods. Once again handful of movements, but this time some false alarms as I stopped trusting my gas. Possibly 3 real bowel movements Thursday, once again mostly mushy and soft minimal blood. Today, Friday some of the cramping has gone as well as the gas but it comes on and off. I’ve taken two bowel movements so far today. One prior to work 7:00 AM, and one just now 3:00 PM. The first one was light, more of a soft and liquid movement. The 2nd today was heavy gas, no pain during the movement, liquidy and soft. This one had much more blood and I’ve attached an image. 

To preface, my usual movements are not daily. Maybe 2 days between. I have not been diagnosed with anything GI related. 

My current medications are Vyvanse 30 mg daily for ADHD and modafinal for narcolepsy

There was a stomach bug that had gone around at work within the past week or two. I associated my movements, pain, gas, diarrhea with this sickness.

383,AskDocs,"I’m F26. The abdominal pain is stabbing-like. I feel it especially when the weather’s colder and only when I’m walking or standing. It comes in waves and it can get so bad in 10-15 minutes that I’m nauseaous and on the verge of passing out. I’ve had it come and go for years. Been to numerous doctors and they didn’t find anything. 

I’ve felt it on my right side but this time it’s on the left side. It’s just a little bit below my belly button on the far left or far left side, I’d say below the rib cage. I thought it has to do with my reproductive system but I’ve had it checked out numerous times and they didn’t find anything. It responds to pain killers (ibuprofen, metamizol, paracetamol) and gets better when I take a hot shower, I rest, sit with my legs up or curl up in bed. I’ve also done a few Xilox (nimezulid) treatments for 10 days (2x1) each and it made it go away for months. 

One time a few sips of alcohol made the pain go away almost instantly whereas I was crying it hurt so bad a few minutes before. Obviously, I can’t and won’t rely on alcohol every day. But it makes me think whether it’s in my muscles or nerves and the alcohol numbed or relaxed it?? So I bought a sportsgel that’s supposed to relax or warm muscles but it didn’t do anything as the pain is “deeper” if it makes sense. 

 Bowel movement is normal, I don’t have to pee more times than usual. It doesn’t hurt to pee. Although I have heavy and painful periods. I also thought it could be endometriosis?

Has tried all forms of medication recommended by two different neurologists who have both advised a referral to neurosurgery for a VP shunt.

She saw a neurosurgeon a few months ago who declined the shunt and advised that weight loss would be her best option.

387,AskDocs,"I'm 35F in great health. Besides depression I have no other medical issues. I'm active and within a healthy weight. I've noticed that I get this slightly tender bump in the crease between my groin and inner thigh and it's in the same spot every time. It comes and goes. I've noticed it for years but lately it seems to get ""angry"" more often and almost every period it swells up. 

At first I thought it was from shaving so I stopped. Then I thought it was from my underwear possibly being too tight/fabrics so I upped my size and made sure I only got cotton. The larger it swells the more it hurts and the skin turns red. It can take up to 2 weeks to fully go away but as soon as my period comes back it is swollen again. Tea tree oil and cortisone cream helps it go away faster as well as not wearing underwear from time to time. I've tried creams for boils, cysts etc. and those never worked.  It never pops, I never see a white head, fluids or anything. It's skin colored or red when it gets really irritated. It feels kinda oval shaped and doesn't move when I press it.

Today(7th day ) , the cough is significantly reduced ( almost gone) , but whenever I try to clear my nose or cough to throw out the phelgm, i find blood at times. 

It's not that everytime I cough , there is blood in my phelgm , but it has happened a number of times today. ( Probably 5/6 times) 
Can it be due to dehydration? Or capillary tear due to excessive coughing? What can it possibly be . I am kinda scared . 

Just to mention , i don't have any significant loss of weight or any lethargy. Kinda anxious tho about this entire thing.

In may 2019 at 33 I had a “bilateral medullary stroke” they said it was a fluke. No imaging has showed any damage. I had to learn to walk again. It presented as trunk weakness. Then eventually my eyes went back and forth like a brain bleed. I lost my voice and could only whisper for a bit. I have left side sensation loss I can’t feel temperature, or pressure. Right side I had muscle loss but I don’t notice any now. I have double vision and a nystagmus. Previous I was healthy. 
Ever since then I have problem after problem. dizziness sweating a whole bunch of stuff. Ferritin is around 25ug/l so I think many symptoms could be that as I have started on iron and b12 and the dizziness extreme fatigue and barely being able to stand upright are subsiding. 

My concern is I have a terrible memory like I’m smart enough to fake it through life at this point but just barely (not working at the moment) And until I changed my diet and started with supplements I couldn’t keep thoughts. I also take creatine every morning and have found it to help me an astounding amount.  

I’m all over the place I know, bare with me, this is all I got and it’s only getting worse. 

It’s getting harder to figure anything out. I’ve watched my dad have the same problem with memory and thinking clearly with moments of clarity same as me. He also seems to have some movement problem as well as epilepsy. 

Also I was a vegetarian most of my life as my father did so much better avoiding meat. That our whole family was vegetarian until I became an adult, or as a teen just bought meat things while out and about with friends.

How can I get this tested? I mean I can just start taking carnitine (perhaps choline haven’t got 100% research done still reading article upon article) eat much less meat no problem. 

I’d assume my stroke was actually bilateral striatal injury. So I’m past the point of really fixing anything it’s more about conserving what I can. but I have two teenage boys.

Probably about 2 years ago at this point I started getting itchy bug bites, under my clothes on my back, chest, upper arms, groin, lower neck, and thighs. The bites are very itchy, the same color as mosquito bites usually, but much smaller, maybe a couple millimeters in diameter. They happen throughout the day and are maybe slightly worse at night. The worst is after I take a shower, when tons of them start to show up and itch (maybe 15-20 on my body, most on back and torso). 

At one point I thought it was bed bugs, but my research wasn't consistent with that. A month and a half ago I brought this up to a primary care doctor (I hadn't been to one since it started), and she figured it was scabies, and prescribed me Permethrin cream.

I covered myself in the cream, then showered after 10 hours, and it seemed to have done nothing to help the problem. I washed all my bedding, clothes, and cleaned my apartment. I did another treatment a few weeks later with a similarly meager results. 

Some additional context that might be helpful--the past couple of years I have been very active in outdoor sports (maybe 2-5 times per week in the woods). I also lived in a 100+ year old house, and the symptoms began while I lived there.

406,AskDocs,"Hello, this is an awkward issue, which is why I’m asking here instead of running to schedule an appointment. I think I know what happened, just looking for some clarification. 


But for all of those who assuredly opened this because of the title, here we go:

Last night, during some *ahem* intimate time with my partner, we were in a position that created a mild-to-moderate bending force on my…self. It wasn’t painful, but maybe mildly uncomfortable, until I had an orgasm. It felt like all the fluid trying to come out got stuck, right at the spot where it was bent(imagine a kink in a garden hose). It was incredibly painful and shocking. I quickly shifted position to “un-kink” myself and everything seemed fine at that point. Until we noticed, during cleanup, that there was some blood mixed in. After a quick check to determine neither of us were actively bleeding, I made my way to the bathroom to pee, and what came out at first was a thick, very bloody fluid, followed by normal urine and a burning sensation. 

The burning sensation has persisted through today, every time I go pee. It’s hard to localize, but it feels like it’s coming from the spot in my urethra that was caught in the bend. 

I’m assuming that the cause of the bleeding was somehow a result of the semen not being able to move freely out, though I’m unclear on the mechanism of such a thing, but I’m more curious about healing time and post-injury care.

407,AskDocs,"My boyfriend (29M, 5'8ish and 135lbs) has been getting sick and then better and then sick for a month now. He's tested negative for strep, flu, and covid. Is there something more going on? Could it be related to ongoing ear issues? What do we need to do for a doctor to find out what's going on? Details below.

1. For as long as he can remember his right ear doesn't hear as well as his left. His right ear also has brown, smelly ear wax and his left ear does not. This has been ever since he was a child.
2. June of 2022 he started getting dizzy spells. Went to the DR (general practitioner) and was told possible ear infection and to move his head around and it'll go away on it's own. He still gets dizzy spells to this day.
3. Around January 2023 his right ear started hurting really bad and started leaking. He went to his GP again and got antibiotics and steroids. It kinda helped but it didn't go away completely. 
4. February 2023 after swimming his ear infection came back and he had an appt with the ENT. Was prescribed ear drops and told he had a perforated ear drum. Again, it kinda helped but not 100%.
5. March 2023 he got a bad cold (head ache, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever). His fever got up to over 103 at one point. His cold lingered for weeks and he is still coughing up mucus almost a month later. 
6. A few days into his cold and after his fever went down, his LEFT ear (not the same ear that had all the problems) started hurting and he felt a pop and fluid drained out. Went to urgent care. The DR said neither ear was perforated and it was a double ear infection. Was prescribed stronger antibiotics. Unfortunately the antibiotics caused him to get really sick. He stopped taking the antibiotics after three days of diarrhea. In the past he's had antibiotics kill his gut bacteria and he almost needed a stool transplant so he's very cautious on antibiotics. 
7. Coincidentally he had a follow up ENT appt a few days after the visit with urgent care. ENT did hearing test and said the results were unusual and that they would like to schedule a CT Scan. It has been a month now and the CT scan has still not been scheduled. He's been calling them about once or twice a week trying to schedule it. It was also concluded that both of his ears are below average hearing, but his right ear is worse. He was also given Flonase to spray in his nose to help clear his Eustachian Tubes.
8. On Monday my boyfriend got a high fever again. Peaked at 102.8. This time his throat was very red and tonsil visibly very swollen.  He has been getting a fever every day since (today is Friday so that's five days). He went to the GP on Tuesday and tested negative for covid, flu and strep. They also did a blood test for mono but he hasn't received the results yet. The doctor said there were white spots on his throat. He was prescribed antibiotics again. The dr also told him to take a probiotic in the middle of the day and the antibiotics at morning and night. This will hopefully keep him from getting sick. So far his gut has been fine, other than he threw up when he tried to take it on an empty stomach (instructions said empty stomach). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried with how sick my bf has been for so long that it can be a sign of something worse. Maybe this is all related to the ear infections? Or did he just happen to catch a bug twice in the span of a month? So far it just seems like no doctor really knows what's wrong or what to do. He just keeps getting antibiotics thrown at him. A few basic tests with no results. Is there something he needs to specifically ask for? Is there another DR we need to try to see? Should we just take him to the hospital?

I have anorexia but my BMI is 17.2 currently. I’m maintaining my weight and I eat 1500-1600 cals per day. I tend to exercise every day.

After looking at a lot of info regarding VWD (type-1) diagnosis criteria and perioperative/post-op treatment l'm left very confused. And it seems there isn't really consensus in medical community about the above?
Due to upcoming hydrocelectomy... My main question is...
With my mild type VWD, DDAVP is considered the go to treatment to prevent bleed during surgery. But my understanding is that my VWF is functional but in lower availability than normal? As in with initial bleeding, clotting is normal... even in my bleeding incident, the bleed wasn't until 2-3 days post-op as clots broke down.
The bleeding during operations was ""less than normal."" I a so understand that the mucosa tissue are more sensitive affects of the VWD. The upcoming hydrocelectomy is not mucosal tissue....
*Is it worth the risk of side effects to treat with ddavp pre-surgery? *The medication will lose effectiveness in a few hours. If a significant bleed were to occur if need to go to the hospital regardless of how I was treated pre-op.
I'm having a hard time understanding the point of pre-op treatment with ddavp. Seems like I'm this procedure it would only help if there was a knicked artery, but the hospital setting would be a good place to address hemostasis as long as docs know about the vwd.

440,AskDocs,"Hello. I'll try keep this as short as I can but it's a relatively long story and.I don't want to just leave stuff out for the sake of it. If you care enough to read a bordering Dr Seuss book on a 17 year old who all things considered is privileged and should feel lucky to be in the position that he's in complain about his mental health then do I have the thread for you! If not, I'll leave a TLDR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when I was young, I always got anxiety over nausea and vomitting. I remember panicking about it vividly on numerous occasions, every weekend I'd eat out with my parents and I'd run to the bathroom every time repeating ""I'm gonna be sick, I'm gonna be sick"" over and over, of course, it very rarely happened from this.

My parents kinda brushed it off, my Mum didn't acknowledge it all that much and my Dad would scoff and it and just lecture me about how it's all in my head and there's no reason to feel this way so I should suck it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

This carried on infrequently for the majority of my life but in all honestly, didn't hinder me too much. I was living life and that was that, i'd have some panic attacks here and there but I don't think that's all uncommon for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about November 2020 and after a year of being completely fine, (I absolutely loved lockdown) I came home from school early feeling very nauseous. It subsided after about 2 weeks but then came back whenever I went to school.   
School break happened then and whilst I was supposed to go back to school in January 2021, schools got shut down again for Covid. I started to feel worse and worse from then on. Anxiety attacks came more frequent as I would start to feel more and more nauseous, and the more nauseous I felt the more anxiety would come and it would just turn into a vicious cycle.

I moved to my Grandparents for about a month during this, and it all went away. I was eating properly again, going out, wasn't anxious, life was good. Then the day before I was supposed to go back to my Dad's where I live, I got the anxiety again. I brushed it off and went back home the next day. Ever since then, more or less all day every day, I'v felt sick. Just constant, chronic nausea. It got worse and worse as the days went on, the nausea and the anxiety. Eventually I was supposed to go back to school in April 2021 and I couldn't and I still can't. 

It reached its climax in July 2021, I had a really bad and traumatic episode and after that, I basically sat in my room for months. I didn't come out, didn't speak to anyone, barely ate, didn't leave my bed, it would feel weird to even walk at times I was so used to just lying down. All because I am too afraid to just throw up, y'know, that bodily function that's supposed to keep you alive. 

Eventually, around the start of 2022, I started to feel a little better. I'd leave my bed, eat some foods again and actually talk to people. Then I got covid around April 2022 and for some reason, when I had covid, the feelings of nausea that I'd had basically all day every day had gone. They came back after I passed it, but it was weird. After that, my anxiety became a lot more manageable. I stopped having anxiety attacks, I still had nausea but it didn't hinder me that greatly, I was eating much more and I got out of the house every day to do normal things. I didn't go to school though, that was still in my mind a thing that would send my anxiety off the rails, and I couldn't get in cars. Still can't, they make me anxious and sick. 

Then, for some reason, early this year like start of January, I had a panic attack. The same one I was used to having every day maybe even multiple times a day in 2021, and I got scared. They started happening more and more frequently again, and I don't know what caused it. Now, I'm back to where i was. I've made no progress. I sit in bed, I eat even less than I used to because I'm scared that eating will make me throw up, I don't really socialise and I'm just don't live life. I want to live life. 

That's where I'm at now. This stupid fear has taken over my life and now i'm not even sure if it is just the fear or if it's something underlying as surely a fear can't control my life to this extent?

i'm not sure what I'm looking for, I guess some advice. I'm at a deadend. I don't know what to do. I know i can get better, but I don't know how. and I know that all that work I can put in to trying to get better can be thrown away just like that. I don't know if I should go to hospital, try medications, nothing. I'm at a complete dead end. 

Any advice or words would be greatly appreciated and if you did read the essay -- thank you. If not, I don't blame you, I probably wouldn't either.

458,AskDocs,"Have you ever questioned your mental stability based upon physical feelings? As in, so many things are going wrong with your body that you start to wonder if it's psychosomatic, or anxiety, causing everything? Because that's where I'm sitting right now. 35F with anxiety.

  
Things started ramping up in December of 2022, but it was a slow thing that's turned worse over the past few months. It started out as fatigue and pain. All-consuming, horrible fatigue. I went from working out 5 days a week, to maybe 2, to nothing. I'm so tired I'm taking naps at work, or falling asleep in meetings. I've started using energy drinks just to get through the work day. The pain started in my right pelvis, moved to my right flank, and now is in my upper right back just below the rib cage. 

  
Then came the dizziness. Not vertigo; dizziness. Like I'm drunk-that level of unsteadiness. But it's not constant. Some days I wake up with it, others I don't.

  
Then nausea-usually accompanied by dizziness, but now it just comes on its own, and is usually a daily thing.

Then a rash. It started out as a full-body, really itchy rash. When that died down, I was left with petechiae all over my body. Not a lot, but everywhere there was a rash. I'll notice a new one every day or so now, particularly on my left inner-thigh, that's accompanied by a constant bruise-or at least it looks like a bruise-just doesn't hurt.

Then muscle weakness and tremors.

Blurred vision-only in the left eye-and visual disturbances in peripheral vision. Not all the time though.

Headaches-usually start in the temples and work their way back. this is usually accompanied by a feeling of ""coolness"" between my eyebrows. Pain killers cannot get rid of them once they're here.

Numb/tingling/cold hands and feet. Noticed after a bath yesterday that my feet and ankles were a little swollen.

Abdominal pain. Just below the sternum. 

Night sweats-not major, but always every morning my clothes will be damp.

Now my left armpit is swollen. It's not painful, but swollen. And it has now become itchy.

Pain. Above all, pain. In my head, my neck, my back, my stomach. I can't get rid of it.

I've gone to my primary care physician, who has referred me to a gyno, (I had an abnormal pap smear and some gyno symptoms she's concerned about), and an internist for the abdominal pain. It's been over 2 months and I'm still waiting to hear from both of them. 

Saw my doctor yesterday for the pain because I'm getting to the point where I just can't handle all these things anymore. She firmly believes a lot of my symptoms are due to lack of sleep, and so is developing a plan to increase my sleep, (I do sleep, but it's not very restful).

I've gone to see her so many times for this, and I always feels like she gets frustrated at me because she doesn't know what to do for me. All I want to do is feel better. I want to be taken seriously. But being politely put off by my doctor like this has really made me think maybe it's all in my head. Maybe it's just my anxiety acting up, or maybe I'm a hypochondriac.

I went to the doctor yesterday and explained my symptoms. They assumed a viral issue, but all tests were negative. No covid, mono, strep, flu, etc..

They said they wanted to do blood work because all the symptoms I am having seem like symptoms you get during an infection, but that it doesn't seem that I have anything obviously wrong. No fever, and all negative tests.

I figured maybe this was a rheumatoid arthritis flare up - which I have not had in 3 years (last flare up was before I got pregnant) but I always have had joint pain during flare ups. I currently have muscle pain, but no joint pain. Doctor didn't seem to think it was an RA flare up either.  


I had routine bloodwork done late February (when I felt fine), and then again yesterday after going to the doctor with these symptoms. [Here is both side by side](https://imgur.com/a/ubu98u5).

I'm including this because I noticed some levels look drastically different than they did in February - specifically the WBC, NEUT#, LYMPH#, CO2, BUN, etc... but I'm not a doctor, and don't know what it means / what is normal, so this could be totally fine and within ""normal"" range.

One more symptom I have is lower back pain. I have done some googling and a lot of people say this means cancer has spread to lymph nodes from the testicles. This is pretty worrying stuff and I have put in an eConsult with the doctors. In the mean time, what do you guys think?


There are no other symptoms, I have had UTIs before, which I know is uncommon for men. 

I had a moveable lump in one of my balls but it was checked out in 2017 and the doc did an ultrasound and said it was just a cyst, so I’m not sure.

The lump is the size of a pea, it's hard but I can move it around, not painful, not itchy, not changing in size or shape and it doesn't have any exterior appearance. It's located on the lower left side of my neck.

I have back acne, but I don't think it's the under skin acne type (putting that information out there just in case it's important).

I've also had armpit lumps (that are painful and small, but last just a few days) in the past year once or twice, but it has been a while. My guess is that the cause of those specific lumps is over stretching, because I'm not that physically active and they happened after I'm more active than usual. My guess is that they were swollen lymph nodes, but if these two cases are connected in some way, please do say so.

Stool:

* Calprotectin 48
* Reducing Substances  0.5 (Doctor dismissed this as not really malabsorption but all the ranges I find on line say it is likely malabsorption with a suspicious range of 0.25 -0.5.  Anything &gt;.5 is confirmed. I think that is odd that he dismissed it.)

Labs:

* Low hemoglobin and hemocrit on THREE separate lab draws
* Burr cells 1+ on TWO separate lab draws
* MPV high on TWO separate lab draws
* ovalocyctes: value was occasional
* Schistocyctes: value was rare
* Atypical Lympocyte % manual 1%

When doc saw the results he added a referral for an MRI of my neck. Should they look at my upper back too in case there is an issue there causing me to lose grip strength?

It's been 2 almost 3 months of this. I  was using retinol and had a terrible reaction to a new moisturizer  (COSRX snail mucin cream). It burned and stung, and I developed tiny  little whiteheads all over. Over the past 2 months, I've tried nizoral  and clotrimazole. Nizoral briefly cleared it up, but I introduced  skincare back into my routine too soon and now nizoral doesn't even  really clear it up. Anti-fungal treatments sort of work but doesn't  clear it up completely anymore. I've also tried a sulfur mask but it  doesn't help either. Right now I'm using a zinc/sulfur/salicylic acid  soap and it helps with the itching on my chin.

I went on 2 separate, short courses of prednisone coupled with about 5 months of a steroid inhaler (breztri aerosphere). I also had a short course of doxycycline around the same time.

My breathing got better overall, but I still had some throat tightness and upper respiratory symptoms. An ENT diagnosed me with LPR, and omeprazole has been keeping that under control.

As of now, I have been on omeprazole for about 7 months, and I’ve seen a huge improvement in mucus and throat tightness.

At the ER, my blood pressure was 160/90 and heart rate was in the 130’s while sitting down. It stayed liked this for about 2 hours. Doc said it was a vasovagal response. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed high glucose (132) but no ketones in urine or anything else.

23M normal bmi no underlying conditions, vaped a few years so far

I have had a lesion or patch of erythema on my left bucal mucosa for about 3 and a half months now. First seen by a dentist twice who said it wasn't of concern but it persisted so I saw an ENT who also had no concerns but gave me kenalog to try. It got rid of the patch but after stopping comes back. I saw them again after it got more red and they said to go back on it. Went back on kenalog and it pretty much faded entirely as you see in the pictures. I saw an oral surgeon just for their thoughts and they believe it to be just trauma that is taking a while to heal or possibly lichen. I saw my ent last week who said to stop the kenalog as it healed but since last week it is again reappearing. All believe it is trauma but i can't convince myself it's nothing aside malignancy. 

Is it time to push for a biopsy?
Should I prepare myself for some very bad news?
Does something malignant in this location come and go, responding to steroid?
It is starting to come back as I feel the rough patch in the last photo

481,AskDocs,"I (28f, Caucasian, 160lb) just got diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome. No blood clots have been found. I have my follow-up consult with the specialist next week, but I wanted to arrive prepped with information since I have a lot of questions and don't really know where to begin, but we will have limited time and I'm about to lose my ""good"" insurance, so I want to do what I can to ensure I can make an informed treatment plan (or lack thereof) right away.  


CT w/contrast results:  
""Focal narrowing of the left common iliac vein secondary to extrinsic compression from the overlying right common iliac artery, measuring 4.0mm in diameter between the right common iliac artery and lumbar spine, equivalent to greater than 50% luminal narrowing""

US Varicose Vein Duplex results: compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery was visualized.  
Left common iliac vein velocity:  
\- PSV: 9 cm/s  
\- PSV: 24 cm/s  
\- Ratio: 2.7  
\*everything else on both scans was normal, except for a small gallstone (but FHx there)  


Long story short, after international travel I woke up with bad pain (couldn't put pressure on it) in my lower left leg. Got US right away, was negative for clot. Was a week of pain, then subsided. No color changes, no warmth. 3 weeks later pain returned, but worse (7/10). Could not walk on it at all (not weight-bearing). No color change, no warmth. About 4 days into the pain unilateral edema (all left leg) appeared. Pitting edema. Went to ER, negative US again but elevated D-dimer. Edema has been present ever since (it's been 2 months), but only had the horrible pain during the two 'episodes' mentioned. Some achiness on occasion now. Edema not super noticeable in morning but gets worse throughout the day as I stand on it for work. This all prompted the scans, and now I have this diagnosis. I've been on 20-30mmhg knee-high compression stocking for a short time now, doctor said I might need to switch to thigh-high.  


**My questions are:**  
1.) Is this a mild case of MTS?  
2.) I was already informed that it's not recommended to place a stent in someone so young - is this true, and if so what are my options then? Compression stockings for the rest of my life? So far I'm not a fan of them at all, I can't picture doing this for decades and decades longer.  
3.) What considerations are there for my future? I've read things about how exercise (to what extent?) and pregnancy aren't the best idea when you have MTS. Any truth there?  
4.) What about associated conditions? I read a research paper with results that showed a clinically significant association with PFO and MTS. It also said that some adults with PFO have chronic migraines (I've had migraines since I was 6yo and now get them about 4/week, in addition to other headaches). Is this even something worth brining up/testing for? Again, if there are chances of anything I need to test now before I lose my good health insurance.  
5.) Along with #4, I take Excedrin Migraine multiple times/week to treat the migraines. Is the aspirin having any effect here? Am I expected to go on to take preventative blood thinners since I have MTS, or would that only be called for had a clot been present? I'd be worried about losing access to my Excedrin - as of now it's the only thing that treats them.  
6.) How much higher are my chances of DVT now (Note: I'm on combo pill birth control)? Will compression stockings or a stent normalize that risk? Are there other associated risks?  
7.) Does MTS progress over your lifetime, or should I expect it to remain as-is? Does it ever improve?  
8.) The intense leg pain I had during the two separate 'episodes' - is that normal? Why would I have sudden onset of symptoms (without DVT - it seems a clot is the main reason MTS gets discovered?), with leg pain being the first presentation of it but being confined to those episodes, and then edema sneaking in there during the second episode only to hang around? It just hasn't seemed to follow the normal course I've seen listed online. Am I still at risk of that horrible leg-pain returning? I'm a small-business owner, and I \*have\* to work on my feet, and both times these episodes hit it nearly crippled myself and my business for a whole week straight. That's one of my biggest worries moving forward.

On a throwaway since my girlfriend follows my account.    


So around august time I’ve been having issues with swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and pelvic area only on the right side.    Recently since around January I’ve beginning to get more swollen lymph nodes on my neck and Slavic glands are swollen to the point of not being able to lay my neck onto my should or pillow without it feeling like it’s choking me I guess?     So far I’ve seen my pediatrician who first told me it was a cyst in my armpit and pelvis and needed to get it drained.     Then 2 days before I was going to get it drained it stopped swelling and went around.    After about a week or 2 without a issue in armpit or pelvis they both came up with a huge burning rash.    I was prescribed steroid cream to help with it but all it seemed to do was make it worse so she recommended I stopped using it and use lotion which helps but it still comes up time to time.      Since January I’ve had about 8 swollen lymph nodes on my neck cause issue like a plank of wood in my neck not being able to bend it in that way.  From around October to now I’ve gotten strep 4 times and every time I’ve been on medication it goes away and comes back in next month or so.    I’ve also had issues with not being able to sleep and issues just with sleeping in general or being tired 24/7 and having zero energy.    Most likely the stress about all of this but idk it may be something to add.   Since august 24th I weight 138 pounds and now I am down to 105.    I’ve been working on my diet more and more and nothing seems to help my case with gaining weight.    I saw a endocrinologist about diet and stuff like that but they said my current diet and things I am doing seem fine and they have no idea on what is going on.    After that I went to a ENT doctor to see what she thinks.    After meeting with her once she recommended a thermal ultrasound on my neck.     So far she said she was able to find 8 lymph nodes that are concerned and 2 of them which seem to be malignant by the coloring and distortion of the size of the lymph nodes.     On my right Neck it says LEVEL IA IB IIA IIB Enlarged right level 3 lymph nodes.     Level III mildly enlarged right level 2 lymph nodes.    Left Neck LEVEL IA IB IIA IIB enlarged left level 2 Lymph node.     Level III lymph node shows loss of normal architecture measuring 1.8 x 0.4 x 0.8 cm.  I’m not sure if I input this properly I don’t understand this sheet much so I put as much as I understand in this post.   I just put this here because this is all foreign to me and just want better understanding towards it.     She explained it and what the concerns are but I know how doctors like to sugar coat things and not tell the full story.       April 19th I am going in for biopsy’s on my neck to try and remove all of the concerning ones and goes on from there.     I just want to get other medical professionals opinions on what do you think it can be?     My father and grandfather had thyroid cancer in there mid 30s so that was a concern but it hasn’t been brought up yet.       Let me know what y’all think and just be honest and straight up I’ve already came to terms if it’s something bad so I don’t mind hearing what you guys actually think about it and what else I should do instead of just wait for my ENT to slowly pick at it.",t2_5k4ybyx2,0,18 year old possible lymphoma,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12m4any,True,Best_Introduction309,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12m4any/18_year_old_possible_lymphoma/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12m4any/18_year_old_possible_lymphoma/,474821,1681492464,0,,False,1681492475,1681492476,2023-04-14 17:14:24,,,

Some of my favorite foods are apples and strong black tea.

Prior to this, I would start every day with a cup of tea. Now, I would love to get my caffeine intake from tea instead of soda (I don't like coffee), but I can't drink a single cup of tea unless I've had two heavy meals already, or else I will get super nauseous for a couple hours. I would love to have an apple with peanut butter (one of my favorite foods) as my breakfast, but if I eat an apple before lots of carbs, I feel sick to my stomach until lunchtime. I know both of these foods are high in tannins, and I'm sure that's what is affecting my stomach. My pcp has basically told me the medical version of ""sucks to be you.""

Earlier this morning, my chest suddenly felt painfully tight/under pressure for a few minutes.  The pain was worse on my left side, which is still slightly uncomfortable.  Shortly after it began, my left ear started ringing and then became muffled and my hearing is still diminished on that side.  Now that the pressure in my chest is mostly gone, there’s a sensation I can only describe as feeling like there’s cold water on my heart.  The only similar feeling I’ve ever experienced was getting an IV saline flush.


I wouldn’t have considered the ear ringing and reduced hearing to be related to the chest pain if not for the fact that the same thing happened twice in one day last week (except for the weird cold feeling after).  Since it didn’t kill me the first time, I’m just wondering if this is something I need to seek treatment for or just something weird I have to put up with sometimes.


(For reasons I won’t get into, l live with my parents, cannot drive, and am not on the best terms with them.  So I’d rather not ask to be taken to an emergency room and require expensive tests if this is nothing to worry about.)



 ⁃ I drink alcohol maybe once a month, ~2 drinks at most
 ⁃ I don’t smoke or use any other drugs
 ⁃ I’m not on any prescription medication, but I do take over the counter allergy medicine and sometimes ibuprofen or acetaminophen for migraines
 ⁃ I take vitamin d daily and 65 mg iron (325 mg ferrous sulfate) 2-3 times a week as recommended by doctor for mild anemia
 ⁃ I get migraines with aura, often multiple a week (since childhood)
 ⁃ I’ve always had unusually heavy menstrual periods but no diagnosis for them

503,AskDocs," 

39F, 5'7"", 128lbs, white. Generally really healthy honestly. Never smoked, social drinker, and I walk 6-7 miles every day.

**Existing diagnoses:** OCD, anxiety, depression

**Current Medication:** Xanax 0.25 - 0.5mg as needed, Amitriptyline 5mg (this med wasn't started until after my symptoms persisted for months)

**Complaint:** Sleep issues and night sweats for 3 straight months, every night. The sweats *always* accompany a wake-up from extremely vivid dreams, though they are not nightmares. I will sleep for 3-4 hours, then wake up from a dream with my legs dripping with sweat. This will continue with me falling into another vivid dream and waking up with legs sweating about an hour later.. goes on until the morning.

I'm not drenching the bed and it is ONLY my legs and knee pits that sweat. After a full night of 'episodes' the sheets under my legs will be a little damp, but my pajama shorts and underwear are mostly dry. My head, armpits, shirt, etc... are all dry.

**Other Info:** The sleep problems started 2 weeks after I recovered from a fairly mild Covid infection (my first one ever). It was also during a period of extremely crushing stress and anxiety about some other issues that are still ongoing, but even when I go to bed NOT feeling anxious, the vivid dreams and leg sweats still show up.

I realize I'm almost 40 so perimenopause isn't off the table, though I'll mention that my periods are regular and normal and I've had no obvious changes to my cycle during all of this.

**Tests I've Had:**

\- Brain MRI with IAC, with and without contrast, 2 weeks ago. Results were normal. This was not done because of the sweats, but because of some longstanding tinnitus and lingering dizziness from a vestibular neuritis years ago. Covid worsened both of those symptoms and it worried me.

\- Hearing test and tympanometry. Results normal. This was also done for the symptoms above, not for the sweats.

\- Blood tests (CBC, TSH, liver and kidney, fasted glucose). All normal except my WBC was 3.6 (ref range started at 3.8 or 4). Doctor told me not to worry at all about it since I don't get sick frequently or contract infections.

\- Vestibular testing. This revealed a 'weakness' in my right ear that uncovered what my doctor thinks is leftover from an old vestibular neuritis from a couple of violent vertigo attacks I had years ago (I've had intermittent mild rocking dizziness since then, but it got way worse after Covid).

\- I've taken my temperature during several of the sweaty-dream wake-ups and it is always normal, around 97.4 which is my norm. So I don't think I'm spiking fevers during the night.

\- I don't have any swollen lymph nodes in my neck, collarbone area, or groin.

**What's Been Tried:**

So my doctor thinks that because I had the worsening tinnitus/dizziness as well as loss of taste/smell for 2 weeks from Covid, that it's likely it also messed with something neurologically and is causing these lingering sleep problems. He thinks through habituation to the tinnitus, physical therapy to get me back to my normal for the dizziness, and just... time... things will improve with my sleep as well. He thinks it may be a form of long Covid, but he's just guessing of course.

My psychiatrist, of course, thinks it's all anxiety (and yes, my anxiety HAS been chronically high for a long time now) and put me on a low dose of Amitriptyline at bed to help with sleep and ""dry me out"". I've been on it 2 weeks and I do think I'm sleeping a little better but the vivid dreams and sweaty legs persist.

**Overall Question:**

So obviously, you Google 'night sweats' and get a lot of scary stuff. I'm sick of seeing doctors over this and my other issues and really would like to get back to my life and see if, with time, it will stop.

My question... is it safe to do that? With my specific symptoms and the tests I've had done so far, should I just put this to rest, work on lowering my anxiety, and try to move on? Or should I be seeking other tests?

My only issue is it’s gotten a little bigger since it originally became a hole. It’s also in a horrible spot since when I walk that part of my body moves / stretches. The area is still a little inflamed but doesn’t look infected. I have no fever or chills. 

Should I give it a few more days or schedule an appointment with my doctor to potentially get stiches? I’d say it’s approximately the size of a tic tac in size.

Wednesday: Still warm in the morning (37.3C) so we opted to let her rest at home. Her temp reached 38.2C before bed, gave paracetamol. 
Thursday: Low to no fever in morning but fever hit highest temp around lunch time at 38.9C, treated again with paracetamol and cool fever forehead patches. She also developed congestion and is producing a lot of mucus. Treating with steam and some vapor rub. 
Friday: Low fever in morning but she started expelling yellow/green mucus. Fever again at night, 38.6C. Light cough at night. Lethargic.

Shes now fast asleep after taking an antipyretic. She also has not lost her appetite and has maintained good energy until today (Friday). Is the mucus color change normal/alarming and at what point will she need antibiotics?

Every so often I’ll have what I feel like is tension headaches, they start at my neck/the base of my head. This doesn’t happen very often. 
It gets worse with bending and it seems to correlate with sinuses. 
Sometimes there’s a slight discomfort in my neck but I also have poor posture and use my phone a lot looking down. 

I was born with frontonasal dysplasia and have had a lot of reconstructive surgery on my eyes, nose, and head. Even my ears. 
I have a mesh plate in my head, the forehead. I had two encephloceles (spelling?)  
They had to bring my eyes in closer together. 

I had an eye doctor appointment yesterday and they didn’t dilate my eyes but took an in depth picture of the inside of my eye.

Medications: Tacrolimus 0.1% and Cortizone 10
Smoking status: very occasional

In November last year, I felt my lips start to itch and get a different texture. Within a few days, my lips began to get so dry that cracks appeared, and small cuts when I smiled and moved my mouth a lot. 
Then the whole skin started to peel and itch even more. And it only started to get better after there was no protective skin left and the entire area was completely sensitive.

What brought a lot of relief was the continuous use of Aquaphor ointment.

I went to a dermatologist in Brazil who evaluated it and said it was not contagious. It seemed to be derived from emotional stress, diagnosed it as atopic dermatitis, and gave me an ointment with tacrolimus 0.1%.

The medicine did not do the desired effect, so recently, on my own, I decided to use Cortizone 10 ointment on the ends of my lips, and this is the only thing that has brought me an immediate result. The next day I woke up, and the skin started to improve again. 

But, I know this medicine should not be used constantly as I have been using it, least of all in the mouth area. Besides, I can't stand treating the symptom and not the problem anymore because it keeps happening even with the use of Cortizone. 

Does anyone know what this could be and how to treat it correctly?

518,AskDocs,"I’ve been in an SNRI called Trintellix (anxiety and depression) for the last two years at 10mg taken once daily at night. Recently, I’ve felt like the anxiety isn’t pulling its weight when it comes to my anxiety, so I met with my psychiatrist. He floated the idea of increasing the dosage. Since I’m VERY sensitive to medication adjustments, he put me on a 15mg dosage (1 pill 10mg and 1 pill 5mg) until I adjust. Then we will discuss going to 20 if necessary. 

Anyways, I took my new 15mg dosage around 5:00 pm with dinner. Shortly after, maybe 30 - 45 minutes later, nausea, room spinning, upset stomach, and an electric feeling in my head all started to kick in. This all lasted throughout the night and into the morning. 

After speaking this morning to a close friend who knows I’m changing my medication, she asked if it’s possible to split the medication (5mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening) for the time being in the hopes the side effects will be lighter.

All in all, my question is: is splitting medication this way different than taking the dose at one time?

522,AskDocs,"Hi Docs 👋,

I'm a 25f with a question that has been killing me for over a year now. Last year I went to a neurologist (again, first one told me any testing is a waste of time after diagnosed with PNES) because I've been having since I was 14:

*Chronic dizziness (came later around age 19 after Lyme disease treatment)


*Chronic Fatigue/with excessive daytime sleepiness 


*Left-sided numbness/weakness


*Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (or dissociative seizures)


*Muscle weakness


*Speech impediment(was there, got worse)


*Chronic headaches


*Cognitive issues, memory, focus, I had the memory of an elephant and turned into a goldfish. I can't even follow a conversation anymore. This has been my biggest grievance. I can't stress this part enough. My memory was almost Savant level, my memory was near photographic(I am also diagnosed ASD). I really prided myself on it but that was one of the first things to go. The long term memory and sense of space and time. By time I was 16 the short term started to go. I had an argument with my mom before school and I was thinking back on it not even an hour later and I could only remember a few words and the emotions. That's when it really started to click that something's wrong( I remember that clearly cause the realization was jarring). I also had to keep relearning algebra every year. I can keep going but I'll hit the character limit. I digress.

So he booked me a EEG, MRI, CT scan, and lumbar puncture to check for fluid build up,and things like MS. Which brings me to my question...

How am I asleep while fully conscious?

Bizarre question I know. 

The EEG was a short 25min one, she did the strobe test(that hurt). Lying there trying to relax, my body does what it normally does and ""shuts down"". I can't feel my body except my palms and heels against the bed. It's like sleep paralysis or equivalent to stage one sleep. I got my eyes closed, trying not to move them. Tech kept coming over the speaker to tell me to stop moving my eyes and to relax haha. I'm fully conscious during the whole test. I never fell asleep. I just couldn't feel my body.

Test finishes, and I got the notification literally the moment I walk out the door that something was posted on my health portal. The doctor I guess was back there reading the test in real time and posted a *""report""* ( not a real *final* report. In fact there was and still is no final report the only evidence of the test is the office visits progress notes) in this report it states: 

Patient history: 24-year-old with left-sided sensory deficit.  EEG is requested to look for area of cortical hyperexcitability.
 
Level of alertness:  Awake and asleep
 
AEDs during EEG study: Lorazepam. (A fucking lie)
 
Technical aspects: This video-EEG study was performed with scalp electrodes positioned according to the 10-20 international system of electrode placement. EEG recorded using qa Natus system with a sampling rate of 256/s and a past band of 1 to 70 Hz.  Electrode impedance was less than 5 kilo ohms.
 
BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:
Posterior background activity: The posterior background activity consisted of 8 to 10 Hz moderate voltage rhythm distributed symmetrically in the posterior head region and was reactive to eye opening and eye closure.
 
Beta: There is 15 to 18 Hz, 2-3 uV beta activity with irregular morphology distributed symmetrically and diffusely.    
 
Slowing: none   
 
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Interictal epileptiform activity: none 
 
Ictal Activity: none
 
OTHER EVENTS: none
 
SLEEP RECORDINGS: 
Stage I and II sleep architecture including vertex waves, K complexes and sleep spindles were seen.
 
 
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: 
Hyperventilation : Not performed
 
Photic stimulation: Did not produce any photoparoxysmal response. 
 
IMPRESSION:
 
This is  a normal awake and sleep recording.
No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen throughout the recording. 

The lorazepam is a lie. Idk what her issue is with me but I NEVER said anything to the tech about it because I did. not. take. It. Yes it was on my chart cause the second Neuro Dr. Prescribed 2 pills. 2! That I used for my MRI/CT and spinal tap. Two different days. She took it apon herself to put that there to make the readings make sense. Please tell me I'm not crazy.

525,AskDocs,"Hello! I’m a 21 year old female. Over the last 4 months I’ve been experiencing insomnia as a side effect of the generic adhd medication I had been taking and as a result, developed the anxious habit of cracking my knuckles a LOT. I used pop them occasionally but now it’s just constant when I’m not even thinking, literally if my hands aren’t occupied with something else I’m pushing on my knuckles, even if there’s nothing to be cracked, at all times. Like, a LOT a lot. Since this started, I developed calluses on the highest joints of almost all my fingers - I’ve never had these before except for a smaller writer’s bump. I’m a skin picker, too, so this hasn’t been great because I impulsively pick the skin off these calluses. I’ve chalked them up to my knuckle cracking habit but I didn’t realize that that basically never happens. I’m wondering if since it’s a constant habit it might be the cause of the calluses in my case or if there’s something much more serious going on.

526,AskDocs,"I (23M) recently got the results back on a full panel STI test, and everything came back negative, the RPR for syphilis came back reactive. The ratio was 1:2 and my physician said that it's likely due to syphilis exposure, so she sent me to the Health Department. A woman there told me that because the FTA test came back non-reactive, I don't have syphilis. She also mentioned that autoimmune diseases may cause a false positive for the RPR, but I don't have any autoimmune issues that I know of. It has me in a bit of a frenzy because it has me wondering if I have HIV in the early stages, even though I tested negative twice (I gave plasma a couple weeks ago and they also tested for STIs, I've since haven't gotten a call back from them, and they haven't stopped me from giving plasma) that could flag the RPR, or some other underlying issue I'm not privy to. Also I'm not sure how relevant this is, but when i got the blood drawn I had a swollen lymph node at the top of my neck where it meets the underside of my jaw, in the middle but not deadset middle, more towards the right side, and it was close to normal size by the day of the physical. My bloodwork collection date was 3/24 and my last sexual encounter was sometime in the middle of December.

Exercise 3x week  
Been taking vitamins for a month to boost sperm quality as advised by the fertility specialist and urologist  
Currently going through IVF with SO. In the past month tested for the following:  
Neg STI/STD  
Blood and urine fine only slightly elevated SHBG, doctors said it was not a concern.  
Spermogram below average possibly due to the flu 3 months prior since the first one back in 2021 was above average.  
Urologist found varicocele grade 2, but no further action/surgery required atm. I knew about this as a lump on my scrotum but went to my GP \~15 years ago and they said it's of no concern and AFAIK it's been the same size since.  
For the past 5-ish years I've experienced the following symptoms and I recently asked the urologist but his only remark was that it is what it is due to age and I would like a second opinion to have some peace of mind.  
Every couple of months, straight after ejeculation I experience discomfort in my groin/penis/colon. It's not really pain but rather feels like everything is irritated and I have the urge to urinate and have a bowel movement. If I do any of that, it helps for a short while but the feeling returns quickly. The whole thing lasts for an hour or so and then nothing for months.  
Additionally, sometimes when I feel under the weather (like when having a cold) I experience the same symptoms for a few days constantly but very very mildly.  
What could be the cause of this? Is there anything I can do to prevent this?  
Also, as a curiosity:  
Can using a cock ring potentially be harmful considering my grade 2 varicocele?  
Could it be beneficial since it restricts blood flow therefore preventing possible overheating from grade 2 varicocele?  
I only recently bought one and tried it a few times.

About 2 or 3 hours ago I started feeling a sharp pain in my right testicle. I got scared because testicular torsion is a big fear of mine. I'm aware of all the symptoms of the condition, most notably, the sudden excruciating pain. My pain is sudden and sharp but not the worst pain ever. I would say it's an 8 or 7 out of 10. It is not constant, it pulsates and comes and goes, lasting at most less than a minute. At the moment I don't feel it. Physically inspecting the testicle feels fine. There's no swelling, color change, tenderness, dizziness, or nausea. I can walk and sit without any symptoms. I also don't have any pain in my lower abdomen that you would feel when hit in the testicles. I frequently have gas pains and noticed that the pain is very similar in nature. It's sharp, sudden, very painful, and fleeting. I'm not very sure why I would feel gas pains in my testicle, I'm thinking maybe referred pain? Given everything I feel, I'm unsure if I should go to the ER.

Several months back, I noticed muscle spasms in the outside of my upper left arm (I can’t remember the name of the muscle — tricep?) 

When it started, it was only when I positioned my arm a certain way, and it stopped after I stretched my arm out or moved. 

It’s now to a point that it’s literally near-constant, and it’s genuinely driving me insane. I’m constantly pressing on my arm or shaking it out trying to get them to stop. My left arm is my dominant arm, and it’s difficult to focus on getting things done when it’s always twitching. 

I’ve stretched, massaged, rubbed, done anything I can think of to help, and nothing is making it any better. 

I got my Covid vaccines in this arm, and I’m wondering if that’s relevant — not in a tinfoil hat way, just noting that that’s the only difference between my arms I can think of. It’s only my left arm, and there have been no injuries or anything of note.

After a few weeks of this, the symptoms got worse to the point of being constantly in a state of feeling off balance and clumsy.

I went to my doctor and she looked in my ears and said I had a massive wax build up in both ears and that she couldn’t see my ear drums.  She thought this could be the issue.  She tried to irrigate my ears with no success cause the wax was too hard.  Told me to go home and use debrox drops for 4 days and come back.  The crazy thing was the second I walked out of her office, I noticed my balance and coordination came back immediately.  It was the best feeling ever.  Even though they didn’t get the wax out, I thought okay, she must have moved it around just enough to take pressure off of whatever was causing the issue.  The next day at work, I felt incredible, thought I was back to my old self again, went home that night, out the ear drops in for the first time, within minutes of that, I felt the symptoms kick in immediately again.  I thought okay once they get this ear wax out it’ll go away, it’ll be fine.

Discussing this here first because I'm so anxious and emotional about the subject that I don't think I can have a whole conversation about it in person without losing my cool, but I have questions.

- How awful is recovery?
- When the ovaries are also removed, what are the long-term impacts?
- Is it worth paying for genetic testing to help decide if the procedure is worth it?
- If genetic testing doesn't reveal anything, does that mean I don't need to worry about it?
- If genetic testing does reveal an issue, are the odds strong enough to make such a significant surgery worth it?
- How would oophorectomy impact my odds of developing osteoporosis or any other medical condition associated with female hormones?

549,AskDocs,"Hi! I’m 21F, 150pounds, 5’3. I’ve been diagnosed with severe ADHD since I was 6 years old and have been taking medication ever since. I’ve been on Vyvanse practically my whole life, currently on 70mg. I also have an extender of Adderall 10mg which I take as needed. I’m on Buproprion 300mg, I also have a Nexplanon. A few months ago during my regular ADHD checkup my doctor said she is concerned about my heartrate and how she wants me to go see a cardiologist over summer. She said that she wants to make sure my heart is okay to continue taking medication and if they tell me not to, to stop taking my ADHD medication. 

I’ve had crippling anxiety about this for months since that appointment. I feel like making me stop taking my ADHD medication would be the worst possible thing for me. When I’m there my heartrate is around 118bpm, however, my apple watch has my average resting heart rate around 60-80 every single day. For the past week it has averaged: 76bpm. Past month: 68bpm. Past 6 months: 67bpm. Past year: 69bpm.

MY MAIN QUESTION: If I do go to cardiologist and get a 24-48 test of my heart, how high would be too high and they tell me to stop my medication?

I understand needing my heart to be healthy. I’ve recently started exercising and I’m planning on doing more cardio after my semester is over for school.

I’m just terrified of being forced off my medication and was wondering what you thought. I am going to discuss this with my doctor at my next appointment, but I know that me being taken off my medication would be the absolute worst case scenario for me in my day to day life. I’m not going to be in the same state during summer so I’ll have to see a cardiologist in a different state, so I can’t just change my medication. 

I also think I unconsciously get anxiety every time my pulse is knowingly being taken since she keeps saying my pulse is high. Yet this is one occurrence every 3 months. I feel like that isn’t a good thing to go off of. In the past she had me measure my heart-rate every single day for a month or two with an oximeter and I did that and my heart-rate was fine.",t2_jen6qglh,0,should i be concerned? adhd question &amp; cardiologist,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12m21pm,True,OtterWolves,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12m21pm/should_i_be_concerned_adhd_question_cardiologist/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12m21pm/should_i_be_concerned_adhd_question_cardiologist/,474809,1681488167,0,,False,1681488184,1681488184,2023-04-14 16:02:47,,,

I had a echo cardiogram a few weeks ago because my gp discovered a heart murmur, during which the technician told me he had found a very small leak in a valve which was nothing at all to worry about. 

I also had a CT scan for an unrelated issue (chronic left-sided pelvic and leg pain, blood in urine) and it came back noting I had signs of Nutcracker Syndrome, May Thurner Syndrome and ""right-sided cardiac insufficiency"". Is that the same thing as the leaky heart valve? So still nothing to worry about there?

Here's the exact wording of the findings: 

IMPRESSION : CT Abdomen &amp; Pelvis study reveals - 
CT signs of Nutcracker syndrome with compression of the left renal vein. 
 
Compression of left common iliac vein is seen between right common iliac artery and underlying vertebra. This may be of clinical significance (May-Thurner syndrome), if there is left lower extremity pain, edema etc.

My urinary health declined a year ago after receiving fellatio w/o protection. A day later it hurt to pee, had to pee a lot and started having clear discharge. Didnt have health insurance at the time so eventually went to urgent care and got a shot of penicillin maybe? And prescribed doxycycline, eventually felt better but every couple of months would have UTI issues. Down the line I found out I had hsv2 which would make since how every 3 months it felt like I had an STI but never had any physical OB’s so I was surprised when I found out. 

Around November I woke up one day woth my back super inflamed to where I had to walk at an angle, during this time I found out I had hsv2 and took treatment. During I felt a little better but as the 7 day treatment came to an end I could tell I was going to start feeling the same before I took it. Last week I started getting pain in my right side thinking it was my kidneys. Went to the ER they scanned my organs, blood work, UA all came back inconclusive.  I have an appointment with a urologist next week.

Hi, 

I’ve had this chest rash on and off the last 2 months- I figured it was a yeast infection- I get these when I’m constantly wearing sports bras (I never rewear a sports bra either), exercising intensely 5/7 days of the week and I’m showering lots (sometimes twice a day- working out and then commuting to the city for work and showering before bed again- I know it’s not great- but working with the lemons I have).

And so this creates this environment where I get these rashes- however I’ve never had it for this long and it’s never looked scaly like this.

I used Butenafine Hydrochloride (lotrin AF) and now I’m trying Miconazole Nitrate. 

When I was using the Lotrin AF- I was able to scrub off the scaliness and things looked somewhat normal again- I also used a heavy intense moisturiser on top. However it came back and so I tried the Miconazole which seems to have worked but it’s left my chest scarred. I have quite sensitive skin and am eczema prone.

So now I’m back to this.

I apologize for the long post, but my father has really been through the ringer. Our family is desperate and any suggestions/tips would be greatly appreciated. 

In 2019, he underwent back surgery and the surgeon punctured his dural sack (?) which resulted in him losing all feeling in his left leg and a drop foot. The only thing he can feel in his left leg is extreme nerve pain. When the pain is at its worst (it is as I am typing this), he “squirms”uncontrollably with sweat pouring from his forehead, can’t eat/sleep, and has absolutely no quality of life. 

Things he has tried that have had little to no effect at all on the pain:

1) gabapentin
2) opiates
3) implanted nerve stimulator in his spine
4) implanted morphine pump that is supposed to target the affected areas
5) medical marijuana and CBD

At this point, our family feels like there is absolutely nothing that can be done to help his pain. He has seen a countless number of specialists that cannot seeem to find a solution.

On Saturday I noticed little bumps on my ankle that were slightly itchy. Thought it was nothing and that it would pass, put on some hydrocortisone cream to relieve the itch. However the onset was sudden and it has gotten progressively worse by the day. My feet have been tender to the touch. (I will post photos for your review)

On Wednesday I went to the ER. there was crazy amount of inflammation all over my feet and legs and I have raised purpura and petechiae on my feet and legs just below my knees. I could barely walk, the itching turned into stinging and blistering pain even when I was just sitting down. The labs came back normal and thankfully any and all life threatening diseases were ruled out. However, the ER doc didn’t know what was causing it. He prescribed that I take 5 days of Prednisone and referred me to a rheumatologist (who’s next availability is this coming Wed.) and if they didn’t know they would send me to a derm. They were initially going to send me to wound care but I kept telling them there were no open wounds.

Today is Friday and after taking 2 doses of Pred, the swelling has reduced dramatically and I can at least walk, but the dots are still there. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I posted recently about undergoing transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery 2 weeks ago for a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's Disease. During the surgery I experienced two cardiac arrests requiring CPR. My chest hurts something fierce but doctors said the x-rays didn't show any visible fractures. 

I just got access to the x-ray reports and the initial report noted ""low lung volumes with crowding pulmonary vasculature. There is apparent widening of the mediastinum. Lungs and pleural spaces are unremarkable."" They talked about doing a CT scan of my chest but it never happened.

The cardiology team briefly followed up with me while I was hospitalized. An ECG found long QT and the hypothesis for the cardiac arrests was a vasovagal response. They asked me if I faint easily and I don't, but I do feel lightheaded and weak if I stand up quickly, exert myself, after going up stairs, etc. but I assumed that was the Cushing's.

I just got a GP this week. Is this low lung volume/pulmonary vasculature crowding/wide mediastinum business something I should follow up on? What does this all mean?

The doctors in the hospital didn't mention the stuff to me. Cushing's did lots of damage to my body that I'm trying to heal, so being aware of everything is important to me.

587,AskDocs,"Long story short, I struggle with severe anxiety that has me stuck in the house and causes severe panic attacks when I go out (excluding short dog walks on the field adjacent to my house). 

I was initially taking lorazepam to help me do car journeys and go to doctors appointments but they no longer want me to take it.

My doctor suggested a few options (just going to use M for mirtazapine and P for promethazine), including M and P. 

I’m not keen on anti-depressants and while I don’t doubt they could help, I can’t see them providing instant relief of symptoms when I’m out in public, which is what I really need.

I understand that P can be used similarly to benzos and I’m told I can take this a couple times daily to ease symptoms. 

One doctor told me I can take them together, another told me I cant. The reason he gave was because both can make you sleepy so combining them will make me EXTRA sleepy. Is that the only reason why I can’t? And what makes that unsafe? I understand for things like driving, etc but I don’t drive or “operate heavy machinery” so would I be exempt from this? Or is it that combining them will literally make me pass out without realising? 

It’s worth nothing that if I were to take both, I would take M daily and P the same way I take lorazepam, as an when needed (e.g. appointments, drives, visiting family or if i’m just having a lot of extra anxiety for some reason). Would that make it okay? I couldn’t figure out if the doctor meant I can’t take them together PERIOD or just not at the exact same time, meaning if I took my M at 1pm, I should wait a few hours before taking P?

I know both medications allegedly help with nausea and sleep, which would be crazy helpful for me. 

But if I can only take one, I’m really torn. 

Would it be better to take M daily or P daily? In the sense of easing my fault symptoms and helping me get better. 

If I can take both, as I said, I’d take M daily and P in moments I need extra help. That’s the ideal situation here.

I suffer mostly from physical symptoms. It’s physical symptoms that cause my anxiety, nothing else. So it’s a vicious cycle.

Also, the doctor said to take M an hour before bed. Is this imperative? I get nervous trying medicine around new people so would rather try it in the day when Im by myself, not when everyone’s home and the house is quiet.

Also I’m 24, female and the only other medication I take is desogestrel.

590,AskDocs,"I'm a 39/f, weight 95lbs, height 5'7"" who went into the ER yesterday evening for chest pains during bad palpitations. My weight is not usual for me and my doctor still doesn't know why I lost so much. 

I was triaged and had an EKG while I was waiting to be seen. Then I sat in the waiting room for about 7 hours, until I felt better and asked if I could sign myself out and go home bc I have a doctor's appointment the next day (now today, I go at 2:30). The nurse told me I could sign myself out AMA if I wanted, just stop at the front desk to ask for the papers. So that's what I ended up doing after sitting that long bc 3 ambulances had just pulled in and I didn't feel like waiting any longer and I did feel slightly better and had an appointment with my regular doctor the next day.

I just checked my patient portal bc I had a notification and it was my EKG results. Here's a link to the actual report with my name blocked off. https://imgur.com/gallery/yFOVIEI 

Should I be skipping my doctor appointment and heading back to the ER? Or is there some benign explanation for this? Again, I sat for around 7 hours in the waiting room and nobody seemed concerned about me or told me any dangers with leaving. If it was important for me to stay and they told me so I would have stayed!

598,AskDocs,"Hello again Redditors of r/AskDocs,

I have another skeleton question. This time it concerns an intensely painful swelling of my tailbone, which started 2 weeks ago for no discernible reason.

PATIENT OVERVIEW

I am a 29-year old White male from Vancouver, Canada. 5’7 feet tall, 130 lbs. 100% pure from all illicit substances. I have a genetic heart condition, a history of prolonged sexual / emotional abuse, and am afflicted by OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), which damaged my joints through ritualized cracking.

HISTORY OF AILMENT

My maternal grandmother has a split tailbone and claims this is genetic. I am unsure whether I had tailbone issues as a young child, given that she locked me in a crib all day or a plush chair. However, at age 9 I fell down stairs and landed full-force upon concrete on my tailbone, which caused a small crack, excruciating agony, and inability to walk well or sit down for a week. I received no medical attention for this injury.

During my overweight adolescence, sitting became a constant pain, yet my grandmother kept me at a computer nearly 24/7. In adulthood, I lost weight and the issue resolved despite a continually sedentary lifestyle. Years later, *Return of the Tailbone Slam* is now happening in my pants.

THE CURRENT PROBLEM

Two weeks ago my entire tailbone enlarged and now sticks out as a swollen, hard bump under the skin. It is impossible to sit on the softest surfaces, and getting up from a seat guarantees a lightning bolt of agony. I feel a duller pain even while standing or walking around. The locus of pain is the lower part above the anus. The top part creates no pain.

My legs are also spontaneously weakening and numbing out of nowhere. Moreover, I often feel tingles explode from the tailbone up my back while trying to fall asleep on my right side.

Nothing changed in my physical existence to induce these issues. I have a semi-bedridden existence ever since my Covid infection in February, given that bed is my current refuge from mental stressors. Though I browse the phone on my back, I sleep on my side. I eat the same foods (pizza daily), and take the same medication (Clonazepam aka Klonopin). Weight is stable at 128-132 lbs. No injuries or strenuous activity lately. FYI soon I will implement a healthier lifestyle.

QUESTIONS

- Can anyone identify the cause of this sudden tailbone swelling and leg weakening?

- Will it resolve on its own?

- Any remedies to encourage it to heal?

Complaint: Occasionally while sleeping I am awakened by a weird sensation in one of my knees (usually the right one but can be either). I don't fully know how to explain it but it's an involuntary pulling sensation. After a couple of minutes of this strange sensation, the outside of my quad suddenly feels like it involuntarily pulls upwards very tightly and it pulls my kneecap up into a very tight, almost locked position. I have to jump out of bed and stretch out my quad by pulling my foot up to my butt. After it relaxes, for a few minutes afterwards I feel very shaky, breathless, and drained. It's been happening occasionally for about 5 years. It's not a knot on the muscle like a charley horse, just a tight, upwards pulling.

In the past, I've had knee dislocations multiple times (2014, most recently), and this really scares when it happens, as I feel like my knee cap will dislocate, although it hasn't during one of these episodes. Dislocation usually comes from a foot misstep or being hit in the back of the knee, for me.

604,AskDocs,"
I [16F, 48 kg, 159 cm] have been getting sick every few weeks for the past three-ish months. 

[Sorry for the long post]

At the end of January 2022 I contracted a fever of 38° lasting about 4/5 days, and at the very end of it developed a mild rash on my torso and legs. It went within 24 hours and didn’t have a weird texture, or itch. My skin was just slightly more pigmented/pale red in certain areas. The virus went by itself leaving me rather tired for about a week, but I soon got over it. 

The fatigue, although manageable, gradually worsened until I got sick for a second time about a month later. It was no big deal. I felt a bit tired and had a temperature of 37.3° (technically not a fever, but higher than my usual). It went within a day leaving me even more tired. By this point I was exhausted 24/7. Had tremendous trouble concentrating. Couldn’t do homework. Etc. 

Eight days later I got sick again. Terrible sore throat and fever of 37.8. The fever subsided within a day but the sore throat didn’t. I was eventually put on antibiotics which worked and I “recovered” within five days. By this point the fatigue was becoming unliveable. 

About three weeks after that, lo and behold, I got sick again — similar bug to the one before last. “Temperature” of 37.1, scratchy throat at the beginning that went within hours. Lasted about a day. Mild tiredness. Didn’t even miss any school as it was during the Easter holidays.

It is currently five days later, and I’m sick again. Both my parents have had colds recently but mine is far worse. At this moment my temperature is of 37°, but I am on both ibuprofen and paracetamol. I don’t normally take medication when sick but I had never felt as rotten as with this bug. Last time I took my temperature without meds was this morning and it was 37.5°, but felt MUCH worse. I would have thought it was about 39°. I felt sick and was shaking/twitching uncontrollably. Couldn’t sit up. Legs felt like they were being cut off. Couldn’t look at my phone, read, or talk. 

Some things I think are worth mentioning include:
- I’ve recently had my blood drawn and everything is fine, but I’m slightly deficient in vitamin B9.
- I have complained of sore throats my whole life and was diagnosed with chronic pharyngitis two weeks ago, which I have been put on a ton of medication for.
- The fatigue seems to vanish when I’m happy, or enthusiastic. 

I have health anxiety/OCD which I’m currently in therapy for, so as you can imagine this whole situation is very distressing for me. I beg you to keep that in mind when getting back to me.

605,AskDocs,"Please read, I don’t want to speak to my doctor about this in fear of my symptoms being written off as depression. 

22F, 120 lbs 5’4. 

For years, about 4 years, I’ve been getting progressively fatigued. At first, my doctor just said it was vitamin d deficiency. At the time, I believed it because my fatigue isn’t like how it is now. But fast forward to now, it’s become SO bad, that I’m essentially disabled. 

My doctors have run every test you can think of, nothing is abnormal, except my symptoms. When they ask about my mental health, I always say I’m fine. But if I’m being honest, that’s untruthful. Without getting into too much detail, since I was in middle school, some things happened in my life that left me basically left me feeling self-conscious, sad,  anxious, etc. pretty much daily. While I had friends, a loving family, laughed a lot , etc, this feeling was still always with me, very suppressed/sequestered. This feeling became my norm, genuine happiness definitely wasn’t something I’d say I experienced often. I think my body was constantly in a state of fight or flight mode. 

The reason I don’t tell my doctors about this is because my fatigue is SO PHYSICALLY real. not that physical symptoms from mental health aren’t real per say, but It’s not being unmotivated, or just plain tired and can improve with better mental health, exercise, etc. I wish people could live my fatigue for just 1 minute to understand it. You know when you have a bad case of the flu, or Covid, and you wake up in the middle of the night with that nasty indescribable feeling, where you’re so tired, and your whole body feels generally sick? When you stand up to fast and get really dizzy? Or how you feel after a long hot day under the sun? That’s my constant state. No amount of sleep, naps, water or exercise relives it. I think calling it fatigue is not even doing it justice, it’s so much more than that, like a constant severe state of malaise. I get so tired that I feel unreal, I have crazy brain fog all the time, I just feel like I’m dying, slowly withering away. 

Mind you, I’ve been in a better place mentally these past 2 years, but my body feels like it’s still declining. I’ve really been mentally better, trying to change my life and my health, but now it’s my health that’s depressing me. 

Loved ones have noticed that it’s not all in my head especially these past two years. They see how sick I look, dark circles, no energy, asking if I’m sick or if I got sleep last night, telling me to keep going to the doctors and demand more help. 

I just don’t believe my mental health can cause such permanent physical symptoms to this degree. So many people have gone through MUCH MUCH MUCH worse traumatizing experiences, yet I’ve never heard of them developing such physical unexplained persistent fatigue. 

I’ve been pursuing investigation for around six swollen nodes under my jawline that I’ve had for at least four years, because honestly I think slow growing lymphoma explains this level of fatigue more than (improved) depression would, but with the absence of other serious symptoms, along with normal structure on the ultrasound, my doctors do not think it to be likely. 

Could this all be from my mental health?

Hi everyone,

I have had this problem for the past few years with frequent urination. I pee around every 30 minutes, sometimes less, especially if the weather is humid. Most of the time, only a little urine comes out, but I feel uncomfortable even if it's just a little urine , .  

(when i hold pee for 1 or 2 hours i pee normally without pushing hard)

Sometimes after peeing, I need to go again (i push a bit hard to pee), and only a little amount comes out. When I go out with my friends, I'm usually the only one who needs to visit the washroom 3 or 4 times.

I'm planning to visit a doctor, but my budget is currently tight.

I need to know if I’m being reasonable.

From the title, the normetanephrines test returned high value outside of normal range. About 10 minutes after I received that test result I get a message from the doctor saying my test results were for the most part normal, with the exception of one ( she did not name or address further) and that it does not explain my sweating issue.

Exactly as the title says. I've learned to live with the postnasal drip but not being able to breathe as easily through my nose will never stop being grating. I can breathe well enough to get the air I need but it feels like it's coming through a narrow passageway and takes double the time it should. Everything makes my nose run: Spicy food (normal), hot food (what?), cold food, exertion, anything.. Once in a blue moon it'll start running out of nowhere.

Even when it's not running, I get a nearly constant stream of mucus down the back of my throat and I have to clear it and/or swallow all the time.


I had reoccurring sinusitis as a child (through ages 4-6 I believe) that we had to keep treating and then it went away. So I suspect there must be something up with my sinuses in general. I can't be sure if it's chronic sinusitis, because I had blood work done the other week and my white blood cell count is normal. My mucus is a healthy color. Because of all this, I don't know if there's any infection.

One day at the gym doing strength exercise my heart suddenly started beating hard and fast so I went home thinking I needed rest. Two days after I tried to go on an bike ride with my boyfriend and my bpm was 50 beats higher than normal on 55% of my FTP(watts). 
My fitnesslevel never recovered. Otherwise I’m healthy and have no symptoms other than shortness of breath with my heart rate rising.

I have been through numerous test like ECG, holter-ECG, long time ECG, stress-ECG, ultrasound, in depth blood tests(including endocrine), MRI of heart, abdomen, head, chest and nexk, arterial blood gas stress test, lung fuction tests, CT with and without contrast of almost my whole body including head/neck, DXA scan, xray. All of the test were normal except my VO2max was 21, and there was a possible epsilon wave in V3, that was not confirmed. 

I’m not on any medication. Sporadically using vit-d during cold winter months and iron sometimes. 

Working out with friends and being outdoors has been a huge joy in my life, now that I can’t do this my life quality is poor. I’m yearning to find out what is going on with me.

631,AskDocs,"I am 22, female, mixed race, 5'3, 115 lbs, had type 1 diabetes for over 10 years with currently no complications, don't drink/smoke/do drugs, careful about my diet but I don't exercise

As I get older I started really taking the risk of my heart health seriously but I don't know where to start or what to do besides keeping my blood sugars stable and eating healthily. My parents do not have cardiovascular disease but all of my grandparents did. I currently have no diagnosed problems regarding cardiovascular disease but I am seen as being at high risk for it mainly because of diabetes. And I am scared of heart attacks and strokes and do what I can to avoid them. 

My cholesterol in blood tests: 

HDL: 100 (summer 2018) 130 (summer 2021, my HBA1C was extremely high in this test, I've lowered it since then) 70 (winter 2022) 90 (summer 2022) 85 (winter 2023)  
LDL: 110 (summer 2018) 65 (summer 2021) 80 (winter 2022) 60 (summer 2022) 70 (winter 2023)

Are my cholesterol rates okay?  Is my LDL too high and if it is, what should I do about it? How can I keep my cholesterol in check? I am planning to ask my doctor if I should take statins but I don't know if that's stupid to ask as someone in their early 20's. Would there be downsides to going on statins now?  I also think it's probably not something to be asked to your endocrinologist but another doctor's field idk what it would be

I am also scared of hypertension, it's also something neither of my parents have but otherwise quite common in my family. I am someone who wants to have kids and I am worried that all these factors will cause me to deal with preeclampsia or some heart or blood pressure related complication so I think I should be doing my best to lower these risks if I can.

A colleague noticed I yawn a lot in conversations and asked if I had been evaluated for sleep apnea. I recently got a sleep study done and the results were that I had ""very mild"" sleep apnea and they suggested I didn't really need a c-pap.

I'm just really confused because I was sure it would be a more significant finding. I was hoping a c-pap would solve these lifelong fatigue issues and I was so excited. Now I feel like I'm back to square one.

My gf is a nurse, we iced it heavily and rested.

I recently had a cough starting at the beginning of March. This took away my voice for 5 days and caused a sore throat. I think coughed up mucus from my chest that contained two bright blood streaks. The blood went away after two days. It’s progressing to back pain from the cough. I’ve been to the doctors on 4 separate occasions for this cough. No strep, covid, or flu. I was diagnosed with bronchitis on my third visit and was prescribed prednisone. However, it’s been six weeks and barely any relief from my cough and mucus in my throat. Blood work came back normal and I had a chest x-ray done that was normal and was prescribed another round of prednisone. Is this typical for bronchitis? I should add that I also suffer from GERD.

646,AskDocs,"[22F, AMAB]. Pronouns are she/her, please refer to me as such. Smoke marijuana infrequently. Currently on adderall XR and Lyrica.

Last night I noticed that my flaccid penis was slightly more engorged than usual. Upon examination, there is a visual swelling in the middle section of the shaft. The base where it meets my scrotum is not swollen, and the glans/foreskin is not swollen. It hurts mildly when not being touched, and moderately when it is stretched/ erection. 

As far as I know, this happened suddenly. The day before yesterday, I can note that it did look and feel normal. I did masturbate yesterday. Should be noted that due to 5 years of testosterone blockers and estrogen, I suffer from erectile dysfunction and erections are difficult to maintain, so orgasm is often hard to reach.

Both me and my partner are tested negative for STDS in the last two months. We are very strictly monogamous. We have infrequent sex and haven't done anything involving my penis for at least a month.

I also suffer from an issue where urine gets stuck inside my urethra (I hear this is common for people with large penises, of which I have) and I have to kind of squeeze it out by gently massaging my urethra upwards. Otherwise I end up with urine in my pants.

I also have a long term, cloudy/milky/thin liquid that comes out of my urethra infrequently. It's been like this for several years, antibiotics didn't stop it, and again I've tested negative on an STD panel twice, once after meeting with a urologist and second after I met with my primary care physician. I don't think this is relevant, but I thought because of the proximity and relativity I'd add this just in case.

648,AskDocs,"Hi, for quite some time now (a bit more than 4 years) I've been dealing with what seems to be proximal tibfib instability - sharp pain in the back/side of the knee, exactly on the PTFJ. I've been to numerous doctors and did physical therapy for around two years, with limited success - usually the pain went away for a couple of days and then it's back. The doctors said the surgery is probably ""too risky""/hard to tell if the surgery will help (or there may be some unpleasant long term effects of ligament reconstruction). Taping recommended by PT (similar to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADji0BYH6qU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADji0BYH6qU)) helps a little (i suspect this just helps me to not pull on the ligament as hard) during activity, but the moment I try to push myself harder the pain kicks in even with the taping. This basically totally prevents me from riding bike (which i really like :( ) and partially from running. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious if anybody had the same issue and was able to somehow heal it? Is there anything I could try before going for surgery, like:

\- any particular exercises that would help me stabilise the joint?

\- changing bike settings to eliminate (or minimize) the pain, i think the twisting/flexing motion is the trigger - 10mins on bike is enough to cause the pain even though i can run for 1hour unless i don't push myself too hard

\- steroid injections, any other medical procedures? i guess steroids will just hide the pain for a while?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what i tried:

\- multiple physical therapists - lot of exercises to strengthen hamstrings etc.

\- PRP injections

\- shockwave therapy on the knee/ligament

\- taping

664,AskDocs,"32 year old female. 5 feet 5 inches.  130 lbs. Meds and other dX’s at bottom.  Relevant now, adrenal insufficiency, cortisol 15 mg in the morning, 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mobile apologies 

I don’t know if I’m okay or not.  I don’t feel okay.  I left a voicemail for my endocrinologist but haven’t gotten a call back yet.

I have adrenal insufficiency disorder and am steroid dependent.  I had a rough month and was sick with a sinus infection and on methylprednisone, then got bronchitis and was on regular prednisone.  I was also on antibiotics during both of these.  

I’m supposed to double up my regular cortisol when I have a fever or am on antibiotics for 3 days afterwards.  Yesterday was day 3 from end of abx, endocrinologist had agreed I was doubling up on it for 3 days because of antibiotics.  I take a morning and afternoon dose.  I forgot the afternoon dose and didn’t realize that until today.  

Last night I got very sick to my stomach.  I woke up and vomited up the bit of Powerade I had this morning.  Took a Zofran and my normal morning dose of cortisol.  

Since then I’ve become incredibly shaky and even sicker to my stomach.  I feel just… wrong and really unwell.  My heart rate is up.  I tried to get up and go to work but I couldn’t stay on my feet or walk around, I feel too unwell.  Nausea is getting worse.  I tried taking one extra cortisol pill in case it may help but I’m still feeling worse.

I feel kind of in a haze or out of it.  I’m super tired.  Maybe a teeny bit dizzy but not falling over or anything.  But I’m regularly tired in the mornings and didn’t sleep well the past few days.  I don’t even know that the ER would do anything since I already took Zofran and that’s what they’d give me for nausea.  I don’t want to waste resources.  

Am I in adrenal crisis?  Do I need to go to the ER, or can I just safely go to sleep and let my adrenal system try and go back to normal over the weekend?

675,AskDocs," Hi - no idea if this is the correct sub or not. I considered r / audiophile, but this felt like more of a medical issue than a technical one.

I (20F, no known medicines or anything but I do take multivitamins and OTC Vitamin C and D supplements for no specific reason) have never fainted before.

This first happened a few months ago with a pair of cheap headphones I bought in a convenience shop near my hostel in Italy. I was listening to music on my phone when suddenly the sound on my earphones went weird. I felt weird waves and bad tingles all over my scalp, neck, and shoulders. My  head was pounding. I could hear a sound like someone shouting, and I thought it was the other people in the dormitory having a fight out there.

I used them again later in the day (stupid, I know), and before I knew it, I fainted in a bakery. I've never fainted ever, so I was so scared. I had all the same tingles and sounds in my ear as before. I came to with the ambulance all over me, they said they had no idea what happened.

That was it for a while, until today. I obviously got rid of those earphones as soon as that happened.

I was listening to something with my earphones plugged into my computer. I had the same ache at the base of my head, the same waves and bad tingles all over my neck, arms, and shoulders, and I had the same sound in my ears as before (it doesn't sound like a roar, but like people shouting words that I can actually make out and remember - it never is the music or sound playing through my earphones). This time, I ripped the earphones out before I could faint, and it took five minutes for all of the pain and sounds to go away. My shoulders were also really rapidly twitching up and down, my head was twitching from side to side. I couldn't make it stop.

I have no idea what is going on. I sound and feel crazy. It doesn't feel like electrocution - no way there is enough voltage from earphones to make me feel so bad for so long. Also there has been no common denominator - not the same pair of earphones, not even the same brand. No rain the day before that could have gotten my electronics wet.

I don't know what is happening, i feel crazy.",t2_ld6mp501,0,"Earphones causing first-time Fainting, Dizziness, Pain.",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12lvymr,True,No-College4541,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12lvymr/earphones_causing_firsttime_fainting_dizziness/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12lvymr/earphones_causing_firsttime_fainting_dizziness/,474777,1681476105,0,,False,1681476120,1681476121,2023-04-14 12:41:45,,,

678,AskDocs,"Hi,

I've been experiencing chronic pain deep in my gluteal and right hip area particularly TFL and sometimes front hip flexor. Sometimes a burning sensation can travel down the back of my glute, knee and sometimes toe (pain often feels to be radiating). The right hip will snap every time I lift it and drop it (not when walking but lifting knee up higher). My glute medius is extremely tender, and feels great but painful when rubbed out and is constant source of pain as well. The pain is also sometimes felt in the back directly above the glute.

There was no mechanism of injury as such but I was lifting weights and working a job requiring constant manual lifting when the onset of the pain occurred. I have a feeling of being somewhat twisted at times. My right hip feels weaker and I tend to accidentally slump my body toward that side. My right leg will naturally be behind my left when in a standing position and when I squat down to pick something up I tend to collapse down onto the right side too. I received physio for 8 weeks on my glutes+hip with only minor results, and was recommended a scan but life got in the way and it's on the agenda. I know it's a lot of random symptoms but I'm worried in may be an issue with L4/L5/S1 disc but I wanted to start training again, maybe lifting weights will strengthen and imbalances in that area that may be the source of pain, should I avoid this and book a scan?

The first UTI I had, was on the 7th of March 2023, I rushed to the ER with symptoms of burning micturition, mild hematuria, incomplete voiding and consitipation. The causative organism is E.Coli- ESBL resistant. I was put on nitrofurantoin for 5 days and it seemed to be okay, I also got an enema done. I have had 3 more UTIs since then. The dates are 14th March, 26th March and 13th April. 

14th March - symptoms: burning micturition, incomplete voiding, constipation
Took a suppository and 5 days course of nitrofurantoin- Ecoli was the causative organism 

26th March- burning micturition, incomplete voiding, hematuria, NO constipation, 102° F fever, passing red tissues pieces while micturating, flank pain on the right side for one day.- diagnosed with pyelonephritis and put on IV antibiotics - cefprazone sufbactem for a week (2g dose 1-0-1) after that had oral antibiotics- cefixime and clavulanate (200mg dose 1-0-1) for one week. Caused by EColi. CBC- WBC count 11.8 x 10⁴. Differential leucocyte count - 85% neutrophils 

13th April- constipation, severe abdominal pain, left sided tenderness of kidney, burning micturition, lots of hematuria, incomplete voiding.- again put on cefprazone sufbactem IV, took a suppository for the constipation. Had a contrast CT scan KUB done also for intestines- everything was normal. (I'm not sure if this is relavent but I reacted to the dye of the CT and suffered from anaphylaxis). CBC- normal 

I have visited multiple urologists, they're all saying that my UTI is because of constipation. I then visited a gastroenterologist and he said that the time it takes for the food to pass through my large intestine is probably longer and hence I have nothing to worry about.
I have included a lot of fibre in my diet along with a lot of water intake.- I'm vegetarian 
My kidney function tests are normal.

691,AskDocs,"Occasionally  for the past couple years, I have these scary episodes. They're not as  scary as they were starting out, since I know what to expect, but still  pretty scary.

It starts with deja  vu, but not ordinary deja vu. It's so hard to describe because nothing  else feels like it, but it's like deja vu times a hundred. And usually  with deja vu, there is a certain ""thing"" that feels familiar, but with  these attacks, I'm not even sure what that ""thing"" is. I just get this  really intense feeling like I'm ""remembering something"", but I don't  know what I'm remembering? Often times it's something from a dream, but  not always.

This is always  followed by a intense sense of panic. Like impending doom, pure fear.  When I started getting these, I would get really scared, and maybe  hyperventillate, pace around the room. But now I know they only last  10-15 seconds so I just wait for it to pass. Sometimes this feeling also  comes with a little chest tightness, but nothing serious.

Rarely,  but sometimes, these are followed by a mild euphoria. I'll feel really  nice and relaxed for like 10-20 minutes after, which is nice lol.

I  described these to a neurologist. He said it sounds like possible  epileptic activity. I've never been diagnosed with epilepsy, or any kind  of seizure. I got an MRI and EEG but they found nothing. However, I  still have these episodes maybe once every other month.

The condition is that i'm having like thin white layer on the foreskin and penis head. It is like dead peeling skin, i can peel it but it will leave some sort of scratch but if i run it under the water for long time, the peeling skin become moist and i can rub it/pick it off one by one but it will be painful later near the frenulum.

I cant see any inflammation though sometimes it feel a bit discomfort/tingling/slight pain in my urethra/frenulum - not sure exactly where but around that area.

Full explanation:

Hello, I'm a 27yo M non smoker (never even tried once, not even weed); never taken any drugs either.

I've been coughing up dark brown / black phlegm with a bit of blood the past few days - see picture: https://i.imgur.com/CT9M9D0.jpg

Occasionally, my snot would be black-ish as well, especially in the morning (but not dark brown, nor with any blood).

Not sure if it's a coincidence, but the above started happening a few days after I had been struggling with some stomach issues: on March 31st, after eating at an Indian restaurant the night before, I woke up with a dull but intense pain in my stomach, which made me feel a bit nauseous. It went away after a few hours, however for the following 3-4 days I always felt very full even after eating very little. I'd poo multiple times a day, and I had a constant sensation of fullness in my stomach - even when not eating.

Any suggestions other than seeing my doctor would be very much appreciated, thank you.",t2_2cgdsxcr,0,(27 M) Coughing up brown / black phlegm with blood (non

702,AskDocs,"I have the BRCA2 mutation. There is a strong family history of breast cancer for my cousins and aunts with the gene mutation (early 30s diagnosis of breast cancer across the board), in addition to ovarian cancer (my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer in her 50s), and melanoma.

I recently spoke to a High Risk Breast Cancer clinic about getting a prophylactic double mastectomy. I am aiming to do that this August or September. 

It wasn’t a hard choice. I already get ultrasounds every six months for the ovarian cancer risk, and I was hesitant to continue with many more years of six month mammograms, breast MRIs and breast ultrasounds too. At this point, I feel like my breasts are panthers lying in wait to hop down from the metaphorical trees and kill me. They’re fibrocystic, sore all the time, asymmetrical, lack any erogenous joy for me, and have the capacity to kill me. Good riddance, girls! I meet with the surgeon and plastic surgeon in June.

I ideally want saline implants. I see that insurance generally covers breast reconstruction post mastectomy, but as I am only 32, and saline implants last only so many years, my question is: when the implants eventually need replaced, does insurance usually cover that procedure too, since it is relative to the original mastectomy? Or would I be covering the full cost of that most likely?

I called my insurance to ask, but they told me to refer to my surgeons, and this long term aspect steers whether I’m leaning to implants or a different method of surgery for the reconstruction. 

Thanks for any insight! I am trying to educate myself a bit about different surgical options prior to my appointment. :) in the short term, direct implants seem my most favorable outcome, even if there is a revision surgery down the line to replace the implants, opposed to a more iterative surgery like the fat transfer with spacers situation that requires more surgeries up front, but likely does not require additional surgery many years out. If insurance doesn’t cover replacing implants, I’d look more into other surgical options with somewhat reliable permanence.",t2_7xvjnhoo,0,32F with BRCA2: question about prophylactic double mastectomy and insurance coverage long term regarding reconstruction.,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12luj4z,True,ritualofsong,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12luj4z/32f_with_brca2_question_about_prophylactic_double/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12luj4z/32f_with_brca2_question_about_prophylactic_double/,474765,1681472845,0,,False,1681472862,1681472863,2023-04-14 11:47:25,,,

704,AskDocs,"Hey there dear docs. I'm inquiring on behalf of my grandmother who has suffered from osteoarthritis for years, mainly in her hands but also in her neck. She's 82 years old, around 160cm and 70kg. She's on hormones after getting breast cancer (successfully removed), and medication for digestion issues but unfortunately I don't know exactly which ones and I don't want to push for medical info she seems reluctant to share.  
The internet as well as her doctor has differing information as to what the symptoms of osteoarthritis actually are besides inflammation and pain, and my grandma has been noticing a sudden drop in energy, increased need for sleep, decrease in appetite, and experiences shortness of breath more easily during all kinds of activities (walking &amp; talking at the same time, cleaning etc).   


Are these symptoms attributable to osteoarthritis or maybe just age? She's relatively healthy for her age and these changes have been rather sudden.  
Also, can she do something other than physical- and ergotherapy and OTC pain meds, do manage inflammation and pain?

707,AskDocs,"I’ve read that inner-ear infections can sometimes be tricky to diagnose, that sometimes a patient will have very few symptoms, and not the most obvious ones. But eventually whatever symptoms they do have resolve when treatment for an infection is given.

One of my ears has felt “blocked” ever since I had my ears irrigated 8 months ago to get rid of wax. You know when you have a cold or allergies, and you blow your nose too hard, one ear might become “blocked” for a while? That is what my ear feels like. My hearing has been affected - I can no longer hear low frequencies in that ear. If I block my good ear and listen to some music, it sounds tinny and “shallow,” like an old, crappy transistor radio tuned to an AM station. If I block the *bad* ear and listen only with the good one, the music sounds normal, with low frequencies, and having a deep, full bass sound.

*I’m not asking for a diagnosis*. I only want to know whether an inner ear infection is possible, given my symptoms. I don’t have any pain, fever, dizziness, or fluids behind my eardrum (the doctor verified this by looking at my eardrum via the ear canal). All I have is this blocked sensation, and reduced, distorted hearing in that ear. And I also feel run-down and tired a lot, even though I’m not very busy. 

So I simply want to know if there have been cases like mine that turned out to be an infection, even though that wasn’t an intuitive avenue to pursue. Does this ever happen, even if it’s not that common?

I went to see an ORL doctor and he said that my nasal sept is deviated and unless I have a surgery to fix it, whenever I get sick the infection will go to my ears.  He also perscribed me an antibiotic and after a few days I could hear well in my ear.

I did some reading online and saw that usually people who have this surgery can't breath from their nose at all and have headaches. That is not the case for me. The only issues I have are tonesil stones and on the morning I spit mucus.
Also sometimes when I cry, for a few seconds I can't breath from my nose at all, but it happens very rarely.

I saw another doctor for a second opinion and he said that I don't have any issues with my nose but I should remove my tonsils. 

Now I am not sure what to do.

Before I found the lump, i noticed that i was extremely fatigued to the point that I could barely function most days, couldn't focus on anything, had been losing hair, and felt extremely restless/anxious. At first I chalked this up to stress from work. I do have a history of anxiety/depression and I'm currently in therapy, although this has been noticeably different from previous episodes. I quit my job last November in hopes of finding something less stressful, but still felt very weak and found myself sleeping 10+ hours a day. A few weeks later i noticed the lump and tried to book an appointment. Doctor's offices where i live are still backed up because of covid and were all booked out for months. I kept an eye on the lump while waiting for an opening and haven't noticed any changes/pain in the area, although my fatigue seems to be getting worse, have joint pain, heart palpitations, and i have started waking up frequently at night. Since my symptoms aligned perfectly with it, I thought i was a dead ringer for a thyroid disorder. Last week i finally got in after a four month wait and explained my symptoms to my doctor. She examined my neck and said it was about 1.5 cm and may be a thyroid nodule, but ordered a blood test and an ultrasound at the local hospital to be sure. To my surprise, my blood test results came back with normal thyroid functioning, but did find that I'm slightly anemic (ferritin levels were at a 10, doctor said not to bother with iron supplements). Is it still possible that it's a thyroid nodule? If it is, could it still be causing my symptoms even if my thyroid panel came back normal? Could the anemia be causing this? If it is, how quickly can i correct it through diet? I have a few weeks before they can get me in for the ultrasound which will hopefully give me some answers, but I'm so tired of waiting and I'm terrified that it's something serious.",t2_7wx09c8ps,0,I (22f) have been unemployed for six months because of fatigue.

 I have have brown blood
with small brown clots at 10 weeks pregnant, then 13 weeks pregnant,
then this past week.

I had a small subchorionic hematoma at 8 weeks, but that resolved by
my 12 week scan. I went for an ultrasound at 14 weeks, no blood in
uterus, hematoma gone. Cervix was closed, normal length at 14 weeks.

I went to see my OB today and she used a speculum to look at my vagina
and saw that my cervix was very friable, also used the words cervical
ectropion. She said there was a small cervical polyp and offered to
remove it. I wasn’t expecting any of that in the moment so I stammered
no. We’re doing appointments every two weeks now to monitor it.

I went to a walk in clinic today to get my lab results, negative for
UTI, yeast infection, BV. I’ve been feeling that my cervix was
irritated so at least there are no vaginal infections and it’s likely
due to the polyp and my inflamed cervix. I mentioned the cervical
polyp and the dr quickly piped up “it’s small? Don’t remove it it’ll
be fine.”

I’ve looked at some other threads here and there’s a mix of OBs not
wanting to remove it for concern that it might cause a miscarriage.
Other OBs think that the chronic inflammation from the polyp can cause
infection. I’ve read different scientific studies that say different
things too.

I wish I was past 24 weeks where my baby is viable, cause then I would
just say to remove it. It is kind of my OB to schedule me for every
two weeks so that we can keep an eye on it.

Anyone go through this early in the second trimester? Looking for
reassurance/advice

722,AskDocs,"27F, 5'2'', 105lbs. 

This is a bit long, but please bear with me. 

So I've had bladder/urinary issues for as long as I can remember, even in childhood. Frequent urination and always feeling like I couldn't empty my bladder no matter how long I sit on the toilet. It has gotten progressively worse, especially in the last 2 or 3 years and it's gotten to a point that it is unbearably uncomfortable and a significant hindrance to my everyday life. I'm not kidding, I don't remember the last time I didn't feel like I have to pee at least a little bit, and I can't hold my bladder for longer than a few minutes without pain and the I have to to NOW feeling, and after holding too long it is very difficult to get a urine stream started, which worsens the pain and discomfort. 

About a year ago I finally decided to see a doctor, and I was told I had a severe UTI. This actually surprised me because I didn't have any symptoms other than the ones I'd been dealing with for years. No fever, no burning while peeing, and the fact that this has been going on pretty much my whole life I just thought it was something wrong with me. Anyway, after taking the antibiotics I felt no relief of my symptoms, so I returned to the doctor but my UTI was gone. So I was referred to a urologist. First thing she had me try was flomax. No help. Then she had me try Myrbetriq, which also didn't help and both only made the retention worse. She diagnosed me with overactive bladder and urinary retention. She also had me using intermittent catheters twice a day, and this also gave me no relief. I still had to pee constantly and the catheter wouldn't even empty my bladder. Immediately after using them, I still had an urge to pee and would sit on the toilet and still trickle a bit of urine. I explained this to my urologist and she attributed it to my overactive bladder, but I kind of think she didn't really get what I was saying. Unless my bladder is sending a ceaseless stream of signals to my brain to go pee, I don't see how that would fully explain it. I'm not a doctor though obviously. I will say she never really listened to me and always seemed in a rush to conclude the appointment. Next, we did a urodynamics test, and they barely started the filling my bladder part and I told them to stop because it was almost immediately unbearable, and once they stopped, it took me a good five or ten minutes to get a urine stream going. I was holding back tears because it was so painful and uncomfortable. After the urodynamics test, my urologist still didn't know what is causing these issues, and the solution she came up with was for me at 27 to use catheters for the rest of my life, or to have a surgery to put a device in my back that would essentially control my bladder for me. I don't remember what it was called. Everyone was telling me this seemed like an extreme thing to jump to, and even my doctor seemed surprised and kind of taken aback when I told him. I also told him about one weird symptom I'd been having, which I'd explained to other doctors and nurses and my urologist, all of whom were perplexed and had no explanation. I never experienced burning while urinating, however I sometimes have a burning feeling just in the normal course of the day in what feels like either my urinary tract or my urethra, usually at the same time I get an urge to urinate. Sometimes this feeling will persist all day long. It isn't painful, just very uncomfortable. I'm not sure how he came to the conclusion, but my doctor said this sounded like an ovarian cyst. I'd also been suspecting endometriosis, so it made sense to me. 

So I go the OBGYN. Pap smear was normal, but it turns out I did have a cyst. Two actually, both on my left ovary. During laparoscopic surgery to remove the cysts, it was discovered that I do indeed have endometriosis, so it was removed as well, as much as they could with just a laparoscopy anyway, so I was told. 

I'd heard of bladder endometriosis, and I kind of started wondering if that might be the problem. When the ovarian cysts were discovered, it was also suggested that it may have been contributing to my bladder problems, as one of them was fairly big, and I'm a pretty small person. I was very excited to finally feel better after the surgery. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. My bladder issues are still the same, and I still get that weird burning feeling. 

I really don't know what to do at this point. I stopped using the catheters after a few months because I wasn't getting any relief from them, and after suggesting the surgery my urologist didn't set up any further appointments, so my urine is no longer being checked regularly and I was concerned about getting a UTI that my body wouldn't tell me about again. But I'm also worried about getting one because of the issues I'm still having. I have had my urine checked a few times since my last appointment with the urologist about 8 months ago for other reasons like the surgery, and every time I was told that there was no infection but there was blood in my urine. Some days my symptoms aren't as severe, but on most days, like today, the retention is very bad and all day long I pee at least once every 30 minutes, and that's after holding it for a while because I honestly get tired of going to the bathroom constantly. 

If it's at all relevant, I did mention to my doctor about diabetes since I have a couple family members with it, and because I am pretty much constantly thirsty as well. (Which has also been ever since childhood) We did blood work, and everything was normal, so I have ruled out diabetes.

I woke up at 5:30 for a reason I don't know. When i sat up, i felt a notable headache. I only felt it when holding my head straight, though - tilting it up or down made the pain a bit better. The pain is in a very specific spot in my head, on the left side around the front ""corner"" of my skull.

The night before, i drank caffeine mid-day and stayed up until 1:30am. Other than that, i didnt do anything outside my usual - i was in bed, hanging out, most of the day. 

I quite literally didn't do anything to trigger a CSF leak. I didn't feel the pain before bed. Im not coughing or sneezing. I just woke up with it. As i type this, im starting to feel milk pain when laying down, too.

I keep reading about CSF headaches. My issue is that some sites say it needs immediate medical attention, and some suggest that ""enough bedrest"" can improve ""mild"" cases. My main question is, does it sound like CSF, or maybe a migraine? And should i go to urgent care or the ER? What other symptoms will indicate a CFS leak?

Because of this, I do all the exercises past doctors have taught me with the occasional dramamine to help with feeling gross, and it is usually over pretty quick!

742,AskDocs,"I'm getting a bit worried about an ankle injury I had inflicted on myself over 2 months ago. I was drunk, tried to kick in a door. The next morning i woke up with ankle pain. My ankle wasn't swollen, but felt stiff and painful. I took it slow, thinking it was just a sprained ankle which would heal itself.  


It's now more than 2,5 months later. The pain is still there, no improvement at all. I was wondering if anyone might now how this is possible?  


Details: 36(F), 57kg, 1.65m. Active, (walk and cycle a lot, regular crossfit, running) and athletically build. I smoke a bit still, but haven't touched alcohol since this event in which I damaged my ankle. No medication, no other illnesses.

 (sorry English is my second language, so I might be unclear about the naming of things...)  
symptoms:  
\- stretching my foot so it aligns with my leg is very very painful  
\- because of this I feel whenever I wake up, that my foot and ankle have been in painful position all night while sleeping, so in the morning my ankle is really stiff and painful always.  
\- last week this was combined with a feeling I've had cramps in my calf of that leg, but I can't remember having cramps, but the feeling is always there, so I feel i might walk differently maybe now and my calf is reacting to it?  
\- SEVERE impaired mobility of my ankle. It feels as if my bones are just 'in the way'. I keep track/am aware of my ankle mobility due to weightlifting at the crossfit, and it's really really bad now. It's just impossible, something is in the way, and also it's very very painful  
\- i did NOT have a swollen ankle, like, at all  
\- I do NOT feel instability in my ankle  
\- If i make 'circles' with my ankle there's a popping sound (my other ankle can have this as well, but that's usually just once), my injured ankle makes this sound consistently, like something is slipping every time i make this movement.  
\- it's not particularly painful to the touch, but haven't had anyone else try to tough/move my ankle, so this might not be a good observation  


I can walk normally (but can be painful), i even tried crossfit once last month, we did a lot of running, but no jumping, and to my surprise, it didn't feel more painful afterwards, so that was a good surprise. Unfortunately due to another unrelated injury, i haven't been since.   


I'm getting worried. Especially if this can still become worse. It's a nice reminder every day why I don't drink anymore though, but I'm going for a huge long tru hike this summer and am in doubt how to proceed from here?

At least four years ago, I noticed I had swollen nodes under my jaw, in the left right and middle. I was in bed on my phone with my double chin out lol and i felt a weird movement. So i felt around, felt a couple of squishy/rubber balls. I googled and they said it was normal if you have a sore throat. I used to get strep a lot as a kid. Now i have a sore throat all the time with no infection, it just is the way it is, my doctor said it’s normal, so i assumed the permanently swollen lymph nodes were normal. 

Anyways, fast forward a couple of months ago and I saw tiktoks of people saying they had cancer after having swollen lymph nodes. So i got them checked out at an ENT, did an US, showed normal structure, biggest measurement for one of them is like 22mm. He did a FNA, but only a normal node could be accessed. That came back negative for cancer cells and had normal cell population. He said to monitor and I will return after 6 months and to watch for new growths. I have no lymphoma symptoms except very very very bad fatigue, still trying to figure out what’s causing it even though blood tests are normal. 

Over the course of the last few years i don’t think they grew, maybe a couple more have popped up in the same area, but nothing too crazy. 

My point is: I had covid two months ago, and a small node has popped up on the left side of my neck, rather distant than the nodes under my jaw. I’m not sure if it was there before, it could’ve very well been. It’s small, probably 1cm, moveable, and squishy. It has not gone down since i first felt it.

Firstly, the reason I haven't gone to my GP yet is due to the NHS strikes happening in the UK at the moment. I don't want to put unnecessary pressure on an already struggling system if it's nothing to worry about. 

I've been coming out with hives all over my body (though mostly my face) which also causes my eyes to swell. I also have a lot of redress over my nose and cheeks. I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know, I've never had hayfever, my diet hasn't changed and I haven't changed any of my hair, face or body products for months now. I've been taking over the counter antihistamines as necessary, but they don't really help.

This has happened a few times over the past 6 months and the redness on my face occurs at least once a week and doesn't seem to be triggered by anything in particular. I've also started to struggle with some shortness of breath but put this down to anxiety as I'm currently in the process of moving house.

756,AskDocs,"Okay so, it's me again. I literally noticed this just a few minutes ago and its got me a little concerned, and because I cant see my PCP for another week (and because my provider is extremely booked and my PCP works multiple locations, it's rare to be able to get a call or anything before appointments), I thought I'd ask here.

So, I've [22, AFAB] been dealing with serious sciatic pains for almost a full year now [pain anniversary in like 2 months &lt;3 a Pain-niversary, if you will], and we've yet to fully pin down a cause, as tests show up with nothing and so far all typical treatments have failed. However, one of the really bad symptoms I just  attached to the sciatic pain problem was this intense, striking pain in the side of my ankle, near the joint that you see on the side.

 I dont know why, but I happened to just look down at my ankle a few minutes ago and noticed that there were 2 round protrusions, versus the one where the joint was on my good ankle. After feeling it a bit, I noticed that the joint- the top one, the one I expected- was expectedly hard. However, the less thick [but wider coverage] lump right underneath it was slightly soft and squishy, and even though it wasnt protruding out as far as my joint was, it was still noticeable enough to freak me out.

I tried looking it up to see what it could be, and the only answer I saw that matched up with the area and also the symptoms I've been experiencing was a ganglion cyst. It said that they could be caused by repeated stress to the area, which would check out; around the time all of this started, I had become homeless and was having to adjust to a lot of walking and standing and sitting due to bus routes and the like, though I didnt think much of it as beforehand I had been used to walking as I used to walk to my first job, as well as walking often around my college campus back when I was in school.

I have a photo of it, but I cant post it apparently because theres no option to,,, but I'm starting to wonder maybe if the reason we haven't figured out what's causing pain is because we havent been focusing on or considering the ankle at all, and perhaps this was forming under the surface and pressing on a nerve, and that's what's causing the issue? I'm not a doctor obviously and I'm super new to doing anything health related since I was a sheltered kid who didnt even know how to make my own appointments until last year,,, but my logical brain tells me that could be possible?

Anyway, I'd like to know thoughts on this??? Could this be a possibility, or maybe something is just swollen or I'm freaking out over nothing? Should I bring it up with my PCP next week?

2. On my right side though, they found an inborn inguinal hernia (it said something like patent processus vaginalis) but the surgery record said they did hernia ligation. 
3. They told me not to lift for 4 months, so i waited 4 months before i started lifting with caution 
4. During the times I lifted, body felt perfectly fine (no pain anywhere)
5. On January 2023, I was doing lat pull downs at a relatively LOW weight (60 lbs) when I felt pain on my lower right abdomen and near pelvis
6. I stopped lifting (scared) for months now and it has been affecting my mental health (im a gym addict) :( pain is still there though (dull)
7. It bothers me because there are some movements i cant make. I cant get up the bed without using arms because there is a dull pain on the area when i get up without using my arms
8. I cant explain it but there are positions or movements i cant do because of the dull pain i experience on my lower right abdomen (not including the left) near the pelvis
9. Coughing also triggers the dull pain a bit. When pushing when pooping, a pain rating of 1-3/10 is experienced. I have no problems with pooping in general though.
10. My urologist is done with his diagnosis and cannot pinpoint the problem. We have done ultrasounds and inguinoscrotal doppler test and he says my urological system is fine (no hernias, hydroceles whatsoever). He is referring me to a gastroenterologist instead. Any idea what this might be? He says it might just be adhesions (if I heard it correctly) or the scar tissue acting up, which i find weird because out of the three scars from my laparoscopic surgery, only the right area is hurting. Also it bothers me because I did not experience this pain before that lifting incident happened.

A few weeks ago after exercise I had chest pain, was taken to the ER and diagnosed with a SCAD (inner most layer, LAD, not sure how long but was told it was a ""long"" tear). I have a very very physical career and don't know if this will end it. 




Docs decided not to do a stent or surgery and let it heal on its own. 




Of course with american healthcare my follow up with a cardiologist keeps getting pushed back and no MD will give me answers always referring me to a cardiologist or giving me generic bullshit answers. 




I know this is reddit but I am curious about your opinions on some things if anyone doesn't mind. 





* If I exercise to the same level of intensity or harder, will it happen again? (Even after say, a year of rehab?)

* Can I go back to a career that requires that amount of physical exertion? (Aka someone's max lifting, effort, etc.) 

* Could I safely participate in combat sports?

* If no to the above 3 questions, would electing to have a stent or open heart surgery allow me to return to full form?

Hi there! I’ve recently been struggling with a lot of gut pain, nausea, bowel issues, and a bit of weight loss. 

I had some blood and stool tests done in November, coming up negative for infection, fecal haemoccult, calprotectin, and celiac. However since then, my symptoms have only gotten worse. I followed up with my GP again and he sent me for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. My doctor seems quite adamant that it is just IBS and was hesitant to send me to a scan (told me to take probiotics and fibre, which has helped slightly). 

Now, he’s given me a referral for a gastroenterologist. I know the logical answer is to see the gastro, but I’m student and not in the best financial position. I can’t really afford spend the money just for a gastro to say “yep, just IBS”, especially since my stools and bloods were all negative.

So before I dive into my pockets, does IBS show up on a CT scan? Is it possible to be something else, even with negative stools and bloods yet some colon wall swelling?

+ He is on a light dose of bloodthinners and medication for a femoral artery bypass he had in his early twenties (do not fall through bay windows, kids, it's too much trouble) 
+ He just started eating normally again after a couple of weeks of diet and medication prior to an full gastric check up. (endo/colo) 
+ My parents got checked for glaucoma over the summer during a regular, full eye/visioncheckup. No sign, then. 

For now my dad is mostly very frustrated because he's a painter, so his major pass time is out while he deals with this cold. According to him, it feels like it is, indeed, getting a bit better with time, and he's at the point where he could ""read a street sign, if you held it in front of his nose"". 

(I sure hope it gets better because he went from 'reaching for glasses when needing to read small text' to 'legally blind')

This is about my partner 26 Male / 26M, 6ft Tall, Not on medication.

3 weeks ago he started getting pain and stiffness in his left knee, thought it was from overuse do left it.

2 weeks ago he had an outbreak of 5 - 6 mouth ulcers which he still has, that are extremely painful.

1.5 weeks ago the leg pain spread to his other knee / lower back alongside the stiffness. Rashes also appeared on his feet.

7 days ago called NHS 111,, who advised us to see a pharmacist.
Saw pharmacist same day and ge said tendonitus and advised on taking ibuprofen.

4 days ago pain was so bad ge saw our GP same day. GP was unable to determine problem and has requested a blood test, and said continue ibuprofen.

Blood test isn't for another 3 days.
The pain and stiffness in his legs is getting worse and is affecting his use of getting up the stairs. The ibuprofen is helping less and less 
He's also started having severe panic attacks because he's worried he won't get better / about the blood test.

Where do we go from here?
Call NHS 111 again? Or recall the doctors?

Taking Tramadol, Ativan and cyclobenzaprine as needed. 

So over the last 2 weeks I’ve woken up to feeling of throwing up in my sleep. The first time I just had the feeling and it woke me up in middle of the night. The second time I actually had the vomit in my mouth when I woke up and I began choking on it. Now, 5 minutes ago is 3rd time this happens but it was just feeling of being unable to breathe as if I was about to choke. I jumped out of bed and it took a good 3-5 seconds to feel able to breathe again. 

Now what I can say is a few weeks ago I got traumatic news that makes me need ativan. I take the other two beds because I have a herniated disc that’s very painful and won’t go away.

Location upper stomach near diaphragm 

Any existing relevant medical issues fibromyalgia &amp; PCO 

Current medications none 



For the past two months I’ve been experiencing a burning pain in my upper stomach (diaphragm area). It doesn’t hurt when I push on the area, but when I push on my lower abdomen (intestines… above belly button) it feels slightly inflamed.. 
I can manipulate the pain. As an example, If I turn, slouch over, or lay a certain way the pain will come on, but will immediately dissipate if I fix my position … 
However 8/10 times it won’t be relieved and will actually cause a burning sensation throughout my whole entire abdomen… 

I went to the ER once for the all over abdomen burning pain &amp; they did a liver panel and said everything was fine &amp; sent me home.. I had no imaging. 

The pain subsided completely for about 2 weeks &amp; then came back yesterday afternoon.. I was fine after lunch and a few hours later I decided to lay down bcuz I was feeling dizzy (I have a vestibular disorder)… I started having what felt like heart burn and I ignored it &amp; fell asleep… when I woke up 30 min later, the pain that I experienced in the past was back &amp; hasn’t gone away (has only eased up)… when I move, bend down, or slouch my diaphragm feels like it’s burning..

When the pain is throughout my whole abdomen it has made me go poop &amp; ive noticed I have yellow specs floating in the water (looks like corn, but smaller.. but it’s not corn bcuz I’m allergic). Not sure if this is related, but I don’t notice it any other time…


What could this possibly be?

He rarely drinks and doesn't smoke or use recreational drugs. He's prescribed metfromin, insulin, aspirin, and lovastatin but refuses to use the last two. He also has arthritis in his elbows, for which his doctor tells him to use ibuprofen as needed.  


Late last week he had a nosebleed for the first time in over 30 years while he was cleaning the garage. Initially he was able to stop the bleeding but later that same day the bleeding resumed while he was moving some boxes (15-35lbs). When asked if he had any other symptoms he said he felt fine otherwise. We were unable to stop the bleeding and he went to the emergency room where they tried one or two different vasoconstrictors (He says cocaine was one of them) before ultimately applying a nasal packing.

He came home that same day with the packing still in his nose and was told to go back in a few days to remove it and cauterize whatever had been causing the bleeding.  He seemed in good spirits, if a little shook by the experience. He says his systolic blood pressure at the time of his ER visit was hovering around the low 140s. He doesn't remember what his diastolic was, either way, the doctor that treated him assured him it wasn't a hypertensive crisis.

Two days later he had the packing removed and the doctor at the time determined nothing needed to be cauterized and told him to just be careful for a few days. He was also told to schedule an appointment with his PCP, which he did. Two days after that -- today-- he woke up with a bloody nose that he was unable to stop and went again to the emergency room where the did end up cauterizing his nose this time. He's having some minor discomfort from the procedure but seems fine otherwise. He was also referred to an ENT specialist and was able to schedule an appointment but it's a month from now.

It's concerning that after having no nosebleed or symptomatic medical issues for so long (other than the diabetes), one would present so abruptly and severely without any physical trauma or changes in medicine or lifestyle habits. My questions would be what would be some of the most likely causes of nosebleeds in someone with his medical history (hypertension seems to be a big one)? His visit with the PCP is next week. What would be some good things to bring up or ask about in his upcoming visit that his doctor might overlook but could be important?",t2_113usp,0,68M Sudden hard to control nosebleeds with no apparent external causes,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12ln7kc,True,not_mig,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12ln7kc/68m_sudden_hard_to_control_nosebleeds_with_no/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12ln7kc/68m_sudden_hard_to_control_nosebleeds_with_no/,474729,1681454696,0,,False,1681454709,1681454710,2023-04-14 06:44:56,,,

809,AskDocs,"hi all, i’ve been on my period for about 40 or 50 days straight (not exactly sure because normally i don’t keep track of my cycle, i should, i know. i’m pretty sure it’s been around a month and a half).

i have had intense mood swings and random bouts of anxiety. because big things have been happening in my life i chalked it up to that. i also attributed it to going down from 150mg of venlafaxine to 75mg, about 2 or 3 months ago. i’ve also recently, within the last week, had severe episodes of fatigue and lightheadedness to the point of being delirious. i have also had severe episodes of intense anxiety from seemingly nowhere. i went back up to my original dose 2 days ago, which has helped significantly, but i’m still bleeding and had another episode of being acutely lightheaded and delirious today (admittedly didn’t eat much at all throughout the day but i ate and felt a lot better).  

i went to the ER a few days ago after becoming very delirious and dizzy. i was intensely anxious and even freaked out when my blood pressure was taken and the monitor was getting tight on my arm. here’s the huge dilemma: i have severe trypanophobia (fear of needles). i’ve had this all my life. even when my anxiety is not extremely heightened as it is now, i generally need to take 2-4 ativan to get any shots, and even then i barely manage, if i can be convinced to get them. i’m stuck in a pretty scary situation. i really don’t know what to do. i’m hoping it will stop, but it’s just not. i also have some rashes on my chest/stomach but i’ve had them since august, so i think they’re unrelated and i’ll make a separate post. i know the replies will most likely encourage me to get the blood work done anyway. i have to get an iv put in, which i haven’t even done before. i have no idea what’s going on. i know that’s why i need to do it, but my anxiety is unbearable. any possible info or advice appreciated x",t2_92qlrj27,0,on my period nonstop for 50 days (18F),[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12llw6t,True,komaretzu,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12llw6t/on_my_period_nonstop_for_50_days_18f/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12llw6t/on_my_period_nonstop_for_50_days_18f/,474728,1681451416,0,,False,1681451429,1681451429,2023-04-14 05:50:16,,,

-rapid, unexplained weight gain (25 lbs in 8 months)
-chronic constipation
-fatigue

Medication: methylphenidate (not every day).
Vitamins &amp; supplements:
-vitamin d (for deficiency, every day)
-psyllium husk (every day
-ashwaganda (occasionally)
-probiotic (occasionally)
-magnesium citrate (once a week)

So I’ve been experiencing these mini blackouts/feelings of panic almost every night this past week when I’m falling asleep. It feels like a sudden loss of consciousness along with a feeling of panic, followed by a hypnogogic jerk.

Additionally, I get these, sharp, crampy tight sensations in my chest when I’m laying down.

During the day, I’ll get unexplained heart palpitations (even when I don’t take my methylphenidate or caffeine) and occasional weird, dissociative sensations and heart palpitations + a weird feeling of mania. And my exercise tolerance is very low.

My sedentary bpm is usually 40-100. My pulse feels fine, although some heartbeats feel slightly weaker than others.

My general bloodwork at the doctor’s office is normal except for vitamin D and high good cholesterol. And my blood pressure and heart rate was slightly high at my last visit (2 days ago).

My doctor is going to have me wear a heart monitor for a week. But the monitor hasn’t mailed to me yet and I’m worried that this is something more urgent I should get checked out sooner.

813,AskDocs,"I am an 18-year-old male, 5'8 tall, 193 pounds. I do not smoke and I occasionally drink, but when I do drink it's usually only one or two drinks. As for known medical issues, I only have asthma and am mildly allergic to almost everything under the sun! Current medication is Lexapro 20mg, Minocycline 100mg, Montelukast 10mg, and 44mcg Flovent inhaler. I do not use any drugs.

Moving onto the issue at hand, I have had two relatively minor seizures in the past year. The first occurred while I was getting my first tattoo; I suddenly felt dizzy and passed out. I was told I had a seizure while I was passed out, and my father who was with me had to hold my head(?). After I woke up, I continued the tattoo without issue. 

The second occurrence was a little bit more severe. We were celebrating Thanksgiving and, after having a few drinks, I had the same thing happen. I felt dizzy, passed out suddenly, and had a seizure. This time, however, I vomited and was choking. I would like to say that I was not drunk, as that might be an easy assumption to make. I was a bit tipsy, but I've drank more since then without issue.

I've thought that it's possible that this may be due to blood sugar, but diabetes doesn't run in my family, and (from what I read), alcohol drops blood sugar while tattoos increase blood sugar, so I would assume they wouldn't have the same effect, though I am largely uninformed on the topic. Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this? I really need to avoid bringing this up to my doctor if possible, I live in America and really can't afford to lose my license.

817,AskDocs,"I’m probably making something out of nothing after my 2 y.o. son’s recent appt (per usual), but as I was looking through his CBC results, I noticed it says “giant platelets present.” After googling, which I know is a terrible place to go for medical advice, I’ve convinced myself that my son has a rare blood disorder. I shouldn’t even look through his test results because I know I have zero knowledge about any of this and I’m probably scaring myself for no reason, plus his dr didn’t even comment on anything besides saying “everything looks good.” But now I’m sitting here freaked out that he may have missed something. Is it normal to have giant platelets? His platelet count is on the higher end, so I’m hoping that’s a good sign. I saw that it’s more worrisome if you have giant ones, plus a low count. The only other things that are off, and they’re only barely out of range, are the “RDW SD” and the “MPV” results. I’ll post the full details of the CBC below if that helps.

Tunnel Vision and Headaches a couple months, Hot and Cold Flashes and Nearly Fainting tonight

Head, Stomach, Body

Tipped uterus, Scoliosis (lower vertebrae near tailbone), I have had 2 children vaginally both with epidural, heart disease and heart failure run in my family on my dads side, diabetes and cancer run in my moms side of the family

Wellbutrin?(anti depressant, helps to stop smoking, and lots of other things), Hydroxyzpam?( anti anxiety), Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen as needed 

I have been vaping for collectively about 2 years or so, I stopped when I found out I was pregnant with my second child and had only started maybe 6 months before I conceived, my son(2nd child) is now a year old 

I drink socially and 4 drinks at most 

I 24 F, am trying to find out what will happen to ME or what symptoms I will experience if I am on birth control while pregnant, I don't really think I am pregnant but there's a chance because I went over 2 weeks without my birth control patch on and finally put it on this past Monday and yes I was ""active"" during this time, I've been feeling pretty sick even before this (had the flu) so I can't tell if that's what's bothering my stomach or not but l'm also experiencing head aches, light headedness, hot and cold flashes together, tunnel vision and feeling like I'm gonna pass out.
I have googled my symptoms and I've googled about what happens when you take birth control while pregnant but both are inconclusive especially the latter, it just says what will and won't happen to baby. The hot and cold flashes as well as almost passing out is new as of tonight and yes I was gonna go to the er but it was full and I don’t feel good so l'm waiting until tomorrow morning, but I was hoping to maybe find some advice here as well.

About 3 weeks ago, I noticed a stiffness or a dull ache in the front right of my neck (area just above my right collarbone, around the artery and muscle in my neck there).

I don't seem to notice it much when I'm working out, but other than that I feel it pretty much all the time, and feel it the most when I'm sitting. Again, it's definitely not painful, more of a stiff/swollen feeling.

Hi, so I have a bit of an embarrassing problem. 
I noticed an itch ""down there"" on my labia and cottage cheese like discharge, that is a bit yellow in colour, no bad smell though. 

I thought it was just a regular yeast in fection, took over the counter meds, but it didn't go away. I then saw a gynaecologist who checked me, took swabs for the lab, as well as blood sample (since I have had unprotected sex some weeks ago).  She said it looked like a small bacterial infection but nothing too bad and prescribed me two types of antibiotics. 

One week later I got the lab results, and everything was normal. I went back for a follow-up check, and she said the bacterial infection pretty much was gone and that i had responded well to the antibiotics.  Since all tests were normal there was no need for anything else.

Another week has now passed, the itch is completely gone. There is no abnormal amount of discharge and it doesn't smell bad but there are definitely quite some cottage cheese lumps still. Should I be concerned that it is something else?

Should I just wait it out? Seek another doctor's opinion?

834,AskDocs,"F40 I have a history of Hemiplegic Migraines (since about age 13); on a spectrum with some being quite severe leading to full paralysis on one side for hours &amp; I almost always lose the ability to speak temporarily, &amp; have progressive dysphagia of unknown origin. I am wondering if I am having seizures during HM episodes?  When I have longer auras (4+ days) or when an HM is triggered by light or complex visual fields especially (like light shining through tree branches while driving, complex moving visuals on TV, 3D movies, etc.).  Recently I started to feel very 'off' on day 4-5 of an aura &amp; started to feel an irrational intense feeling of foreboding &amp; dread. Like something bad was going to happen or that I might die. I told my partner I should call my Dr. urgently. Then I lost time &amp; everything went black. I 'came to' with my vision &amp; hearing coming back first, then registered touch, etc. I was standing in my kitchen with my cell phone in my hand repetitively scrolling with my thumb but the screen was black so I had been there like that long enough for the touch screen to time out. I couldn't remember what the thing in my hand was, how to work it, what I was supposed to do with it. I had no idea how I got there, where I was, who I was, who I was with. At some point I remembered I had a name but couldn't think of it. I remembered the thing in my hand was a cell phone but couldn't figure out how to use it nor coordinate my bodily movements to try.  My thought patterns were like this, ""Where am I? :::panic::: Am I alone? House. I am in a house. It's my house. I think I am safe. With my family. I have a family. Partner. I have one of those. Their name is... I need help. I should call to them."" ... but I couldn't get my mouth or body to move at will nor could I speak for a few minutes.  Then it came to me that I was going to call my Dr. but couldn't remember their name or why. Things started to come back to me slowly &amp; seemingly in steps as if I was literally rebooting. Another HM I had was similar but sudden onset &amp; I am 98% positive it was brought on by street &amp; traffic lights while being in the car at night. I lost speech very suddenly, my husband pulled over, called 911, &amp; I failed the stroke test with the dispatcher so they sent an ambulance. The paramedics asserted with me &amp; ER staff that they thought I was having an HM but was also post-seizure because I wasn't oriented well, needed assistance walking, &amp; lost some time then too when they arrived. My Dr. referred me to a neurologist for a workup &amp; I have had an MRI which was clear. Could these be seizures in addition to my HM or are they common with HM in general? I am adopted &amp; they're thinking of genetic testing me for Familial type HM so they can better target medications.

As title states, approx 4 days post op, I began having clitoral stimulation without physical interaction of any sort. It hasn’t stopped. It’s constant and endless. 

Twice now climax has occurred without any intent or interaction, in fact, it occurred despite my best efforts at quelling it. The first time I was driving and had to pull over; the second was in the middle of a work meeting that I was chairing. Immediately after climax it goes back to full go mode (stimulation).

On a scale of 0-10 (10=climax) it sits at 6-8. 

I can’t seem to concentrate at work, I’m not sleeping through the night and some days can’t handle being touched due to over stimulation. The only time I get reprieve is when I’m at Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (physical and metal faculties in use).

My GP believes it’s nerve damage but is awaiting a reply from the surgeon before moving forward on anything. He suggested a neurologist or a sex therapist. He implied the options are severing the nerve or anti-depressants.

840,AskDocs,"I am fairly healthy 55 year-old male based in New York.  After doing side crunches in early February I started getting pain on my right side under the rib cage, that radiates up the back along the outline of the rib case. The pain didn't start until a week after the exercise, so it is just an educated guess that the exertion caused it. It is a burning pain that feels worse some days. And it is sore to the touch. Ruled out kidney stones. And an x-ray of the ribs was unremarkable. Since I have no other notable symptoms, the doctor has not ordered any bloodwork or other tests. A six-day course of steroids (Medrol pack) did nothing to help me. The physiatrist started me on Gabapentin since yesterday after diagnosing me with having muscle trigger points causing pain plus likely nerve damage as well. Even 100mg of Gabapentin a day seems to cause drowsiness. But I am continuing with it. The pain causes significant discomfort.

842,AskDocs,"Hi,

I was using a heating bottle to reduce my PMS back pain and I ended up pretty badly burning myself. I didn’t actually even feel it until I got up and felt a sizzling pain. I checked in the mirror and there was a huge red patch all over my back. I immediately applied Polysporin on it. 

This is the 2nd time I have burnt myself due to a heating bottle, recently a few months ago, I again didn’t realize and I pretty badly burnt myself, despite applying Polysporin, it left a very ugly scar on my back.

The huge red patch went away after a few hours of pain, and now there is a small red ish patch with two blister like patches on my back, I keep applying Polysporin on it and it sizzles every time I apply the ointment. 

Please advise me on what I can do to ensure that there is no scar left! The last scar is so bad and makes my back look very ugly! I don’t want to have a 2nd scar from this.

I have attached images of the burn, and you can sort of see the previous burn too.

Is it because it's nearing my period? I'd never taken BC before until now. I have pretty irregular periods (28-45 day cycles) so it's hard to tell what caused it. I have no history of allergies or hives until now.

I'm worried the rashes will be permanent (happening everytime I'm near my period) or if they'll go away with time. my partner is guessing because i hadn't been on it for very long, it's unlikely it'll be permanent - but there aren't many resources discussing this.

I came down with conjunctivitis for the first time earlier this week (Monday, it's now Friday). My eyes have improved (still bloodshot but not much discharge and not watery) and my fever has slowly faded away but I still need to take the occasional paracetamol.

The most prominent aspect is a sore throat, however, it is not like the normal type of sore throat I have had in the past with colds/flu/covid. This sore throat feels more tender, like it's inflamed, and it is uncomfortable to eat and sometimes even to swallow (nothing alarming, just unpleasant). It does feel better when I take a paracetamol tablet.

Usually normal sore throats go away within 2-3 days max, but this hasn't and as I say, this one feels different.

866,AskDocs,"I'm not really sure where to turn. I (22f) found a lump on the lower front part of my neck a few months ago and I'm worried it's something serious. Before I found the lump, i noticed that i was extremely fatigued to the point that I could barely function most days, couldn't focus on anything, had been losing hair, and felt extremely restless/anxious. At first I chalked this up to stress from work. I do have a history of anxiety/depression and I'm currently in therapy, although this has been noticeably different from previous episodes. I quit my job last November in hopes of finding something less stressful, but still felt very weak and found myself sleeping 10+ hours a day. A few weeks later i noticed the lump and tried to book an appointment. Doctor's offices where i live are still backed up because of covid and were all booked out for months. I kept an eye on the lump while waiting for an opening and haven't noticed any changes/pain in the area, although my fatigue seems to be getting worse, have joint pain, heart palpitations,  and i have started waking up frequently at night. Since my symptoms aligned perfectly with it, I thought i was a dead ringer for a thyroid disorder. Last week i finally got in after a four month wait and explained my symptoms to my doctor. She examined my neck and said it was about 1.5 cm and may be a thyroid nodule, but ordered a blood test and an ultrasound at the local hospital to be sure. To my surprise, my blood test results came back with normal thyroid functioning, but did find that I'm slightly anemic (ferritin levels were at a 10, doctor said not to bother with iron supplements). Is it still possible that it's a thyroid nodule? If it is, could it still be causing my symptoms even if my thyroid panel came back normal? Could the anemia be causing this? If it is, how quickly can i correct it through diet?

867,AskDocs,"Hello,

I am having these awful symptoms that are preventing me from really living my life. Hoping this will help get to the bottom of what’s going on. If you’re reading this thank you and I hope this can help you too if you have similar issues.

I am a 30 yr old female and have been healthy all my life. For the past 6 months I have been having a feeling of throat tightness and wheezing. It feels like my tongue is partly swollen and like my throat is inflamed and closing on me. Swallowing can get effected and i feel like I’m choking sometimes. I have chest tightness/wheezing as well but the wheezing is mostly coming from my upper airway. My nose is always congested. It feels like what I would imagine an allergic reaction feels like, and sometimes my tongue feels even more swollen/numb/tingly after I eat. I can’t seem to pinpoint what actually is setting it off though. 

I started taking Zyrtec about 3 months ago and it really helped this for a couple months but now it’s the worst it’s ever been. I even had my doctor prescribe me an Epi-pen just in case even though all my skin and IGE testing to food came out negative. 

I also take an inhaler for asthma, emergency inhaler, and Montelukast (Singulair)


Medical history: healthy all my life - no asthma as a kid, no surgery, no allergies, nothing. Always have eaten everything in moderation.

3 years ago developed chest tightness/persistent cough which turned to a light wheeze. Drs prescribed me inhalers and said possible asthma. 

Since then my wheezing has gotten so bad that I’ve been on and off prednisone for an entire year. If I go off of it then all the terrible symptoms return. 

Also was having heart palpitations like crazy for about 3 months and out of nowhere they stopped last month. I’m happy they stopped but have no idea why they even started.

PFT’s- normal
CAT scan of neck and chest - light scaring in lung apices, otherwise normal
Allergy Tests Food - all negative 
Allergy skin testing environmental - mild reaction to grass, pollen and mold
Echocardiogram- normal

Any idea what is going on and how I can start implementing some changes/treatments to get my life back?

So I washed it with soap and water for about a minute and see if they would help. Few days later, I felt a sharp pain on the same side as the one I cut it (in this case the left). Didn’t think much of it. But then….2 days later I felt this weird feeling in my neck like when I turn it, it feels warm. Just the general neck area along with occasional sharp zingers in parts of my jaw. It’s been like this for a few days through currently but I feel more and more anxious and petrified. Earlier I was ruminating over the possibility and eventually I began crying and shaking so violently my bed almost fell. I have been anxious over the possibility ever since Day 2 of the cut. I am never shaving my ass again after this. I just want to know what to do because I am autistic male (19M) with little grasp on medical things. I am so scared I want to die and end myself.

So this morning, I woke up and saw that I had a lump about 3in in diameter on my sternum, right underneath my left breast. It may have been there for longer, but I just noticed it today.
 It is not on or in my breast, it is beneath it above my ribcage (if that makes sense). It is soft and squishy, like just poking my stomach would be, and only hurts when I have a bra on because it creates pressure on it. 
I've also noticed some sharp back pain directly opposite of the lump. I've been extra tired and exhausted lately, but I was thinking it may have been something else. My legs have also felt like they're on fire when im extra exhausted. 
I went to see the doctor today, and they referred me out to a place that does ultrasounds, but it will be another three weeks before that place can see me. 
I just want to know if I should be worried during these three weeks or not. I know if I don't get an answer, I'll worry myself to death. I've never had a lump like this before.

892,AskDocs,"Hi.

Over Christmas-New Years last year, I developed a very severe sore throat. My left tonsil was incredibly swollen, the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were a little swollen, and I had very severe left ear pain (like way inner ear). I was tested for COVID-19, the flu, strep and RSV and everything was negative.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 weeks ago, I started to develop cold-like symptoms, mainly a lot of sneezing and itchy eyes. As of the middle of last week, my throat has begun to hurt again. The pain is not as bad as over Christmas, but it is the same left tonsil that is hurting and it's swollen again. The most I notice the pain is when I swallow and especially when I yawn - it hurts a lot then. 

[https://imgur.com/a/5hTM0Fk](https://imgur.com/a/5hTM0Fk)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've included a picture of my left tonsil as of about a half hour ago. It just looks wrong and it's freaking me out and making me very paranoid that something is wrong with me, especially since I was never diagnosed with anything the first time I was having this pain months ago. Can anyone please help me or lead me in any direction of what to do? I figured if it was a cold the sore throat wouldn't have lasted more than a week, and the fact that it's the same tonsil being swollen is scaring me.

First donation after hiatus was slow, the nurse had to fiddle with the needle a bunch but they didn't say anything explict to me. Similiar experience with the 2nd donation.

Again, the nurse didn't provide any information even when I asked what I could do differently next time, but did say they couldn't use the blood since it wasn't a full unit.

I had an MPFL reconstruction of left knee in 2019 and an MPFL reconstruction with lateral release on the right in 2020.


During both of these surgeries and ensuing PT I didn't make a peep about pain. The ligaments themselves are stable, and my surgeon has retired. 


The nerve pain and numbness went away in the left knee, but has gotten worse in the right. I also have frequent extremely sharp pain along the lateral portion of the right knee and occasionally right above the MPFL graft. There is also abnormal swelling in this knee. My SED rate is generally in the low 40s. MRI shows good ligaments, no fluid, and shockingly good cartilage. I have arthritis, but this is NOT arthritis pain. I'm on meloxicam 15 mg and Voltaren gel QID


I went to a rheumatologist of my own accord and was put on methotrexate. The arthritis pain has lessened, but the right knee pain is unchanged. I physically cannot walk up or down stairs, my last attempt led to me falling down said stairs. My job requires standing, but no squatting or lifting. If I am scheduled for more than three days a week the pain gets so severe that the leg just buckles and I start falling. It's not uncommon for me to have to rest in my car for 30 minutes before I can make the 8 minute drive home. This is worse than it was 2 weeks post op.


I have done physical therapy for this knee three times since the operation. The last two times (at two separate offices) I was released early because they both believed that PT was causing me more harm than good. My last attempt ended with the physical therapist begging me to get a second opinion if they kept insisting exercise would fix this. Hence my attempt with the second surgeon.


Two orthopedic specialists in a row have completely dismissed me. They both just want to give me pills and prescribe more PT. I have been begging for 2 years for a nerve conduction study and an arthroscopy to check for adhesions and scar tissue. Both specialists refused both tests and tried to give me gabapentin to shut me up. 


It's becoming completely unbearable to work, and my insurance only lists those two orthos as options. What can I do to make them take me seriously before I end up stepping in front of a bus?

Started last thursday, I went home after school, can't remember if I ate anything, but I think I did, my stomach was hurting pretty bad, and I had sudden pretty severe diarrhea which really took the energy out of me after a long week so I basically took a nap to sleep it off, which worked for the most part. I woke up a few hours later, not feeling as bad, just a bit dehydrated. Didn't experience more pain over the weekend,  except heartburn sunday night but I attributed that to fast food, but continued to have more watery stools than usual. This week I experienced random sudden gas pain and need to use the bathroom, which often left a burning sensation. I would also get random upper abdominal pain (as in the literal stomach area, often an hour give or take after eating, or randomly throughout the day. It'll last a bit, never more than an hour or two, comes in waves of severity. Not enough pain to severely limit me, but bad enough to slow me down a bit. Anyways, the stomach pain is back again and has been going on for about two hours now tonight. I'm not nauseous, it feels like a dull burning pain if that makes sense, though sometimes it gets more sharp. Some intestinal pain comes and goes too. 

Idk if this is a stomach virus, stress related (as my mom suffered from stress related stomach issues at my age), or if its something I ate. Full disclosure, I can spiral about health stuff sometimes and I'm concerned I might have eaten undercooked meat without realizing it and could have a parasite. Is that a possibility? Could it be some weird  infection? I would assume it's a mild stomach virus or food poisoning, but I feel like that doesn't usually last as long, and if it did I feel like it would get better rather than stay the same? But idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please be nice, I know I might be asking stupid questions and I don't usually take my medical symptoms this seriously but I thought I'd ask around if this raises concerns from anyone.",t2_gyjll8q5,0,Come and Go Stomach Pain for the past week.

My 6 year old had her tonsils and adenoids taken out on April 6th, she was what I thought, healing well. In good spirits, never complaining of anything more than “ a little pain “. Popsicles nonstop, ice cream too. Tuesday night, after a full 5 days post operation, she wakes up and starts vomiting blood. We panic, call 911, go the nearest pediatric hospital. They tell us we’ll have to recauterize. Cue second round of fear for the night. I couldn’t imagine putting her through anesthesia again in less than a week. Thankfully it went well, and the left side had active bleeding in one spot which they cauterized and the right side had some tiny vessels that the doctor recauterized too. They kept her for another 8 hours for observation and she was doing well. I guess now we’re all so traumatized, including her, that it could happen again. She hates the taste of Tylenol but pediatrician warned about Motrin possibly triggering the bleeding. Of course, she prefers Motrin. I’m writing this terrified of it recurring and praying it won’t. 

I’m so terrified of her hemorrhaging again and I don’t know how to calm myself. I was told it would be rare to happen again but it was rare to even happen the first time. We’re officially 7 days post initial procedure and I’m wondering at how many days post op can i be confident that she’s healed?

930,AskDocs,"Hello all. Hoping someone could give me some advice for my recurrent aphthous ulcers. 

28M, 6'0"", 190 lbs, Mexican-American, CC of recurrent aphthous ulcers x 2 years. Occurs \~1x per month, sometimes twice, each lasting \~7-10 days. No alleviating factors, aggravated by any mouth movement. These began once I started medical school 2 years ago, and I'm fairly confident they're due to stress. 

PMH - no current dx illnesses, no injuries, no hospitalizations, immunizations UTD.

PSH - none.

MEDS - vyvanse 40 mg po qd x 3 months

ALLERGIES - NKDA

FH - father (T2D x 15 years), mother healthy. 

SH - alcohol socially and 1-3 beers per week, no tobacco, no drugs. 

\---

Things I've tried:

* SLES-free toothpaste (currently use SLES-free Sensodyne).
* Limiting spicy foods. 
* Stress-relief: hard to really do much stress-relief in medical school, especially since boards are approaching next month. I usually do take an hour or two to do some graphic design stuff for fun on my lighter days.
* Sleep: 5-7 hours per night. 
* Hydration: I don't hydrate as well as I should, but I'm working on that. 

\---

My thoughts: Really just unsure what/if there's anything I can do about these. Like I said, I get them at least 1x/month, sometimes twice, usually up to 2-3 at a time. Almost exclusively on the inside of my lips, but this time around I have one on each side of medial surface of my lower posterior gum line. I have pretty good oral health (brush 2x/day, floss 1x/day, mouthwash 2x/day, q4month dental cleanings). I've had them looked at by my dentist and was just told that they're idiopathic and all I can do is try to practice stress-relief. 

I'm somewhat confident that they're just from stress, as I took last summer off and did not get a single occurrence, but as soon as I was back in school, I started getting them again.

933,AskDocs,"Three day’s ago I (M21 67kg) noticed that this particular spot, as well as a couple of others on the leg, were very tender to the touch. More so than other my right leg where I also felt something like it, though painless. The red one being the worst by a bit. 

I notice it when walking at the beginning and when sitting or standing wrong. It’s not swollen but a little bit warm and, as said, tender. It‘s a bit stringly, a long the muscle fibre, but the red one is I think the roundest.

939,AskDocs,"As per the title question. I'm currently 4 months into practicing a healthier lifestyle: I go to bed around 10pm - 11pm, I include more greens and fruits into my diet, I snack less, and I started going to jog at least 2-3 times a week. But if anything, this routine is making me more tired and less energetic.

I only started to become more health-conscious this January. For the past years, I slept around 1am - 2am. I ate more than I should, I snacked a lot, and I NEVER exercised. Yet, I was more energetic than I am now. Right now, I couldn't even wake up earlier to prepare for work. I overslept several times- which rarely happened before. And sometimes, I even take short naps at work 'cause my eyes simply won't stay open, which never happened before.

I'm just genuinely curious. I'm currently not on any medication, and the only supplement I take is the chocolate protein powder. Why do I feel more tired when I'm trying to be more healthy? It's been going on for the past 4 months, and honestly it's stressing me out. Oh, and my temper's also been flaring up more than usual- I get more irritated at even the smallest thing.

Is this my body trying to adjust itself after years of unhealthy lifestyle? But, it's started ever since I began this so-called healthy journey. So, I'm not sure. I'm just really tuckered out. Would appreciate any insight.

So a little backstory. I was walking and I got scratched by a big domestic dog, I live in the US fyi. I didn't really think anything of it. I went to CVS/Walgreens but they said they don't give rabies vaccine then I called my health department and they gave me a location to get the rabies vaccine the next day.

They want me to talk to an epidemiologist before I can get the rabies vaccine. (is this normal protocol? I'm in Florida btw)
So my question is what is the maximum amount of time that I can get the rabies vaccine before it is no longer effective? A quick Google search says 7-14 days after exposure but idk how accurate that is
I want to get the rabies vaccine just to ease my mind but I traveled to 10 medical locations so far that doesn't have a rabies vaccine (except 1) The nurse lady at the health department in Lakeland, FL told me that the health department in Bartow, FL supplies rabies vaccine but she referred me to an epidemiologist first, I don't understand why?? what should I do?? why is it so hard to get a vaccine?",t2_lr7wsxvn,0,Question Regarding Rabies Vaccine,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12lfr5r,True,Reasonable-Bid-4328,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12lfr5r/question_regarding_rabies_vaccine/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12lfr5r/question_regarding_rabies_vaccine/,474692,1681437829,0,,False,1681437840,1681437841,2023-04-14 02:03:49,,,

Background: I've been having episodes of light headedness and syncope for years. My PCP thought I had some kind of dystaunomia and sent me to cardiologist for further testing. Cardiologist put me on a month long heart monitor. They called me with the results a few days ago, and apparently my heart goes in and out of QT prolongation. I have an appointment with them next month to talk about it, but I'm turning to reddit until then to calm my fears.

I'm confused because I don't seem to have any reason to have it?  I had a blood test done the same time the monitor was put on, and I had no electrolyte abnormalities. I don't take any prescription or OTC meds that are known to cause QT prolongation, and I don't have a family history of it or of sudden cardiac related death. I've had an echo, and my heart is structurally normal.

I bought a fitbit with ECG capabilities(and yes I know they are shitty unreliable ecgs) to comfort myself. I notice my QT interval being elevated in the mornings before I take my propranolol and after exercising.

945,AskDocs,"21M 95kg but I don't think this is needed.

I don't think this is just wet dreams. There are times that when I sleep, I would dream of something vague but involves pumping out something. So I would pump the shit out of that something according to the context of the dream (like if I pump this bamboo tube, I'd get high grades in school, it doesn't usually make sense). 

The things is, while I'm dreaming of pumping something, I can physically feel that I'm pumping my penis to masturbate. So I'm in a state of sleep where I am not aware of my surroundings but I'm kind of awake to feel what I'm doing, but it's not registering to me that this is indecent and I should not do this. I only came to my senses after climaxing. 

My problem is, just this morning, I just uncontrollably touched myself with my sister just sleeping beside me! (I feel like she knows what I did and just chose to not say anything). And by the end of April, I'd be having a sleepover with my friends! I can't do this anymore!

For other info, this started when I was like 17. It happens rarely but factors I can think of when this happens is when I sleep late, sleep when I'm tired, sleep after not masturbating for a week. And masturbating does not help. I just masturbated yesterday and look what happened! But maybe because I'm always feeling horny? I can also lucid at my dreams sometimes, and be able to wake up when I 'feel' like I'm about to get a nightmare.

949,AskDocs,"I (29M, 5'8"", 170 lbs.) have been dealing with chronic back pain for about 5 years. The severity varies slightly day to day, but it's always there. It makes it difficult to work a desk job, and I've been thinking of switching to working from home solely so I can get a standing desk.

I've been x-rayed and there is nothing visibly wrong with my spine or discs. It seems to be a muscular issue. I have two bumps (knots?) on my mid-lower back, slightly above belly-button height, about halfway between my spine and my sides. That is where I feel the most consistent pain, but there is occasionally intense pain on a particular thoracic vertebra between the two muscle knots. I also have some lower back soreness, but it's minor in comparison.

Doctors have recommended what you might expect: exercise, improving my posture, stretching, physical therapy. I've tried all of that, and I continue to try all of that, but I've seen no improvements. To go into a little more detail:

* A few years ago, when I was unemployed, I tried physical therapy. I went 3 times a week for 2-3 months. It consisted of stretches, cardio, massages, and chiropractic adjustments. I had to stop going when I got a job offer, but I hadn't been seeing improvement anyway.
* Last year I decided to give my recovery another attempt, so I began doing a daily stretching regimen. This was a mix of stretches I learned from PT, with some others I learned about from youtube videos that were supposed to help with back pain. I did these stretches every day for several months, and instead of improvement, I started getting some new minor injuries with my shoulder and knees. Nothing severe, but it was enough to discourage me into quitting.
* After that, I visited an orthopedic doctor who recommended that I try daily cardio and lose some weight. So I gave that a shot. I spent 30 mins on an elliptical machine every day for 4.5 months, and lost 35 lbs. in the process. Which is great and all, but that wasn't my primary goal. Worse, my knee problems have gotten a lot worse in the past month. I've had to stop the elliptical sessions entirely, out of fear of aggravating them. I plan on picking them back up soon, but being as gentle as possible and only going a couple times a week.

But now I'm in a situation where it's painful to walk, or even stand up for any extended period of time. If I can't sit down without back pain, and I can't stand up without knee pain, what am I supposed to do, lie in bed all day? I wouldn't call the pain severe, but it's enough to make me feel depressed. Everything I've tried to do so far has either had no effect or seemingly increased the pain.

And when I try to research solutions, I keep coming across pseudoscience. I'm very skeptical of alternative medicine, I don't really believe in chiropractic (although I have tried 3 different chiropractors out of desperation), I don't believe in acupuncture at all, or anything ""holistic"". It pisses me off seeing medical centers pushing junk treatments constantly. When I get suggestions like meditation and yoga I just can't get myself to take them seriously. This is a physical condition, isn't it? But maybe it's not, who knows. The mind-body stuff is complicated, I know stress can exacerbate things... But it feels to me like all of these treatments are just placebos, and I'm screwing myself over by not believing in them. But I can't help it.

Suddenly I was unable to eat most nuts, stone fruits, and root vegetables (all foods I had been eating for my entire life without issue). I began smoking weed in my sophomore year of college when one of friends developed cancer as a way to have an activity to do together while he was going through treatment and I have been regularly smoking ever since. Recently over the past few weeks I have began having a noticeable reaction to smoking that I have never experienced before; my hands, feet, and face go numb, I experience extreme shortness of breath (like someone is sitting on my chest and I can't get enough oxygen) which lasts for hours, sharply increased heart rate (but only very slightly elevated blood pressure), and I even passed out and woke up on the ground unable to form proper sentences. This is extremely unlike any reaction I've had to marijuana in the past, as I once was a daily user. I only smoke legally purchased dispensary marijuana, primarily via cartridges and edibles as opposed to smoking flower. I know I am not just getting too high and anxious as this reaction is happening with extremely small amounts of marijuana being consumed. Is it possible I have developed an allergy to cannabis? If so, is there anything I can do about this? I do not enjoy drinking and marijuana has been a great supplement to a night out with friends that I truly do not want to give up. I am currently taking amitriptyline and magnesium oxide for migraines, iron, b12, and have recently discontinued use of single hormone birth control.

Medication: none currently (was on gabapentin for 3 months, 300mg daily)

Hi all. Back in October I had a deep cough that ended up lasting until around January. In December I started having issues with my both of my calves where they felt heavy. I ended up going to PT for a bit in January, which did help but I still have cramping in my calves especially when I walk/try to run. I’ve seen a neurologist and he ordered and EMG/Nerve Conduction but it didn’t find anything. Recently I’ve started experiencing severe low back pain that I feel a lot if I’m sitting or laying. The PT was treating me for a herniated disc from the coughing but after doing more research now, it really sounds like I match spinal stenosis. I have a follow up with my neurologist in 2 months but I was thinking of going sooner due to the pain.

958,AskDocs,"On top of not being lucid or comprehensible, she strangely went to a very busy city hospital that is 2.5 hours away. I haven't been able to get in touch with any doctors. Nor has my sister, who is her health care representative.

A few years ago, my mom had sudden bladder incontinence and the beginnings of mild back pain. She didn't get any tests done and had a tendency to hurt herself in sports so the back pain wasn't alarming at the time. It didn't improve, and her primary diagnosed her with sciatica. About ten days ago, she went to the ER, because it got worse.

There's lots of conflicting information because she isn't the most mentally stable. She allegedly has a mass in her spine. They did a biopsy on it and got the results in less than a day and they were inconclusive.

She's still at the hospital, with no plan (that we can gather from her communication) of next steps besides possibly another biopsy. She is telling us she has: a spinal tumor, osteosarcoma, lung cancer, lymphoma, or just a benign mass. She claims all of these diagnoses are coming from actual doctors (who she hasn't even met).

**What I'd like to know is if this is at all typical for a cancer scare? Do doctors admit patients for suspected cancer and then have no clue when they might be discharged, despite being otherwise healthy?** She's fully ambulatory and besides her usual mental instability, she's her normal self. I'd understand her long stay if she was having symptoms but other than the back pain, nothing is going on.

I hate to admit to skepticism but my mom falsely claimed to have cancer back when I was a very young teenager, and she ended up being perfectly healthy.

959,AskDocs,"\-Hello.

I dont know if this is the right subreddit to ask these kind of questions, but i am down to the last helpless point, i dont know what to do and i have an appointment again with another otolaryngolog the next week. Theres been a while since ive had this feelings, to keep this short and ongoing because it started a while ago, i think its been around one year since it started. Most of the days and almost all the time ive had this lump feeling on my throat that decreases and increases overtime, i dont know what causes it or what helps it to be worse, recently these months me and my parents, im 21years old, decided to go do some check ups and see whats going on, my parents usually tell me its due to stress and anxiety, youre worrying yourself to much with life and all that, thats why sometimes its related to that, and i dont know what to believe, im in a such tough spot that i get scared a lot sometimes for life and i cant sleep at night, but anyway i was glad that i was about to do something about it and see whats wrong. Heres comes the interesting part, i did everything, pipes with cameras down my throat and nose and even a magnetic resonance (MRI), all resulted to nothing, doctors told me that i had nothing down there, this was about 3-4 months ago, and this is not only one hospital, me and my parents went to 2-3 different ones, but only one hospital saw something, they told me that the adeonid (the third tonsil) is swollen and that may cause this ""lump sensational feeling down my throat"", i recieved some pills, they told me also that if i want they can operate surgery and get rid of it, but time passed by and we left it behind as for the beginning and never did go back to that hospital, the other hospitals saw nothing, we were left on a confusion, i was baffled because i didnt know what to do or say, my parents got sad and they just confronted me with some advices to help myself and try to get rid of the anxiety and sadness or whatever goes on in my life that is related to stress, they told me that 99 percent that is the cause, but i really dont know myself what it is, because yes sometimes when i get stressed or worried about something or when anxiety captures over me, it gets worse, i even have a stutter and overthinking about it my whole life has destroyed me completly, that is the only reason that i may be ""sad or stressed"", it has made me hate myself but i dont talk about it, its just me and myself who has this discussions, i try to help myself a lot but sometimes, man its just hard and im ready to give it all, i just cant, i get tired of everything, theres no hope, it destroyes me completly. Anyway this took too long, the topic deviated from one thing to another, im sorry if youve kept reading all the way here. So to explain the feeling that i have had since a while ago, its that it never faded away, i think i even got used to it, but its killing me, theres like something stuck in my throat, it feels so tense and so heavy, its feels like theres mucus stuck in the middle of my throat that doesnt go in our out of there, it just stays there in one place, i rip my throat apart trying to get smth out lol, doing gargle but nothing helps, it kills me completly, its the worst kind of feeling, it doesnt let me stay comfortable and i dont even have the words to explain it, i searched on google and the only thing that came with it was globus sensation, this was the only thing that i related to but as i said i dont even know myself what it is, im in a confusion, ive lost touch with reality and i dont know what to do, i really even say sometimes, hopefully its cancer or whatever so i can get rid of it and actually observe it, and not stay like this not knowing what i have down my throat that keeps annoying me and making me so uncomfortable that i sweat my arse off, i cant sleep at night and it makes me so sad, it has even interfered with my daily life. And about the title, its something that came this days, yesterday when i woke up i started stretching and noticed that air was released from my throat while i was stretching uncontrollably, i said to myself ""this is not me"", who is releasing air from my lungs to my throat, it feels like there a leakage and air comes out when you press it, its like a balloon of air when you push it and it releases air from it, when i clench it and try to release air it feels so weird, like its not even my throat, like theres another guy in there that breathes my lungs and releases air without my permission. I dont know, im just lost.

962,AskDocs,"Hello Reddit!

This past week, I got some blood work done – the first time in over a decade. I was mostly prompted to get this done just for the sake of having a snapshot of my current state, and because, as of the past few months, I’ve noticed I’ve struggle to make any gains in the gym, and perhaps have lost a very small amount of muscle. I’m not experiencing any negative symptoms/ailments per say. The tests (provided at the very bottom) show everything seems to be pretty good except for fairly high AST levels and Testosterone levels at the very bottom of the normal range. I’d very much like to get both of these values closer to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background about me:

\- 33 years old, male, caucasion

\- 6’ 2”, \~195lbs

\- non cigarette smoker, non-drinker, smokes weed once/twice a month (&lt;0.3gram)

\- long term drinker of large quantities of Diet Coke &amp; Caffeine Free Diet Coke (aspartame?)

\- very physically demanding job Mon – Friday

\- 4 day workout split with the 5th day being a rest day (Push, Legs, Pull, Shoulders)

\- takes rest days if local or systemic fatigue detected

\- excellent nutrition, low levels of processed foods &amp; low sugar intake

\- tracks calories (\~3300 daily),  tracks macro and micro nutrients

\- tracks weight daily, very stable

\- generally OK sleep (7.5 hours), occasional restless nights

\- never diagnosed but I 100% suspect I have an anxiety disorder, moderate stress a few times a week

\- sexually molested as a kid, other traumas in early youth including abuse

\- despite trauma, occasional depression &amp; anxiety, generally a positive &amp; optimistic person

\- currently taking no meds

\- supplement creatine, One-a-day multivitamin, fish oil, 10mg melatonin daily.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve read causes for high AST levels and low testosterone could include high Aspartame intake, continuous strenuous exercise with lack of recovery, and hepatitis C – at least these make most sense to my specific situation. Low testosterone could also be a result of trauma in youth, from what I’ve read, or high cortisol levels.

My current plan of action is to throw in 1 extra rest day in the middle of my workout split, completely cut out Diet Coke (these prices are insane anyways) and to get a Hepatitis C test completed just to rule that out. In a few weeks I’ll retest to see if anything changes. As a side note, I’ve considered TRT treatment for some time, but wanted to hold off a few years if I could as I consider it a live long treatment and didn’t want to start before it was necessary, but I am honestly slightly surprised my Testosterone levels were this low.

Looking for wisdom, recommendations, or other information that could potentially shed light on why these values are what they are, and if my plan sounds good.

Oh, and I don’t have a doctor or health insurance because I’m poor AF.

Thanks!!!

NF1, history of neuroendocrine tumor (2003), treatment included Whipple, radiation and 1.5 years on Thalidomide

I recently had a MRI of pelvis/abdomen. Results below:

```
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right retroperitoneal mass. Numerous cutaneous, subcutaneous and scattered muscular enhancing lesions consistent with known neurofibromatosis type I. Overall these findings are unchanged from the prior.
2. Interval development of innumerable liver lesions with enhancement characteristics different from the above-described musculoskeletal lesions and known retroperitoneal mass. Given history of NF1 it is concerning for malignancies such as hepatic
angiosarcoma or metastatic disease. Inflammatory etiology is favored to be less likely given its nodular appearance on the diffusion-weighted sequences. Consider further evaluation with PET/CT and/or biopsy.
3. Post Whipple anatomy. Prior right orchiectomy.
```

```
HISTORY: 50 years old Male with Follow up on retroperitoneal mass to evaluate for malignant transformation

TECHNIQUE: Abdomen and Pelvis: Multiplanar T2-, diffusion, and T1-weighted imaging were performed. 3D T1-weighted dynamic images were obtained before and after the uneventful administration of I.V. contrast.
Contrast: Gadavist

COMPARISON: MRI abdomen 3/11/2022

FINDINGS:
Statements: None.

Lower Chest: Visualized portions are within normal limits.

Liver: Interval development of numerous liver lesions throughout both lobes. The lesions are mildly hyperintense on T2 with ill-defined margins, hypointense on T1 and demonstrate arterial hyperenhancement with ongoing enhancement into the delayed phase.
Lesions are seen well on the diffusion weighted sequences as nodular lesions with some of them demonstrating restricted diffusion. For example a lesion in the posterior dome image 10 of series 1001 measures 1.6 cm. As noted previously, numerous
additional tiny cystic appearing lesions are again seen, likely representing biliary hamartomas.
```

I've got a follow-up appointment next week, but hoping to arm myself with some information ahead of time/come up with questions so I don't have to think of things during the appointment.

* I had a full-body MRI back in October which showed nothing amiss in the liver -- does this necessarily indicate that these lesions are new, or just that the scan in October wasn't ""focused"" enough to pick them up?

* I'm anticipating that the course of action will either be to ""keep an eye on things"" (the approach we took with the retroperitoneal mass) or order more tests, with the latter being what I expect. Is a PET/CT or a biopsy be more likely? Why?

* I'm hoping the concern of ""hepatic angiosarcoma"" mentioned by the radiologist is a worst-case scenario, and that there is something in between?

968,AskDocs,"Sorry for the bad description I am not English and the translator says the words that best describe what I am experiencing don’t exist in English.. 

So I, 25F, 145 kg (~315lbs), 169cm(~5‘54), have lately been waking up to the sensation of the blood circulation to my leg being cut off at my hip. Usually it’s not quite at the stage we’re the leg or feet tingle and sting but my whole left hip does, excessively so and sometimes your can even see the imprint of what I wore (despite me not wearing right clothes) or even just my bedsheets.
I didn’t take it too seriously to be honest because i have quite a lot of problems that never get taken serious by doctors be it for me being fat or them not believing in some of my chronic illnesses (Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS for example) and let’s be real it really does sound like something that would be happening do to massively sensitive skin and or muscles combined with me being so heavy and sleeping on that hip. So I just took off whatever I was wearing when it happened and turned to the other side to continue my sleep.
That worked for a while but lately it has started happening even without any clothes on and not just in my sleep. It’s like the fold between leg hip, leg and crotch, as well as belly and hip are now affecting the are like the clothes used to and it’s starting to scare me.
I can barely sleep on the left side anymore which is the one I usually default to (so that’s probably part of why this affects only my left side..) and since I can’t really take off my fat and turning around doesn’t really do much anymore due to that, I am really a bit lost. 

To further describe what I noticed:
The skin turns red, stings harder when touched, usually took on the texture of whatever I lay on (for example folds in fabric or even just the little rubbles that are in some jogging trousers) at the worst times I had up until now, especially the imprints of the folds even turned somewhat white. Like I’ve only seen with wearing way to tight clothes or when one puts a hair tie on their arm and forgets about it, that looks similar to me though it never hurt close to how much this does.

I could have sworn I made pictures of the worst looking moments when I had this occur but of course I couldn’t find any. So I’ve tried to recreate it which didn’t quite work the way it does when not staged and since I couldn’t be awake trough the pain and couldn’t fall asleep either it really isn’t what usually happens, but I think you can still see what I mean..
Sadly this community doesn’t allow links or photos with so much text it seem? So maybe I can post them in the comments..
If not, I am sorry I hope you all get what I mean and maybe be someone at least knows what kind of specialist doctor I should make an appointment with.

974,AskDocs,"Hello physicians of Reddit,

I posted here before regarding my 15 year old brother. He was recently diagnosed with subclavian DVT and had thrombectomy the next day. There was mild scarring in some regions of the vein given the chronicity of the clot, which was misdiagnosed. However, the vascular surgeon is unconcerned given his age, and suspects that the veins should eventually recover given enough time.

However, they found out via CT venogram that his right subclavian vein is compressed prevent proper venous return, which will predispose him to future clots. The diagnosis is vascular thoracic outlet syndrome. To ameliorate this they recommend first rib resection and anterior scalenectomy. It’s a surgery without potential for complication; most commonly pneumothorax and less commonly brachial plexus injury. 

Can you discuss the nature of this surgery, or if possible any experience with the surgery? Do you know patients who’ve done this surgery?

Then later that evening I went to grab something out of the dishwasher, and Instead I opened up the cabinet under the sink. I stared into it for a minute, confused, until I remembered what it was I needed. After that I went to heat something up in the microwave, and I SWEAR i put the plate in the microwave. Like I vividly remember putting it in there, closing the door and starting it up. But as the time on the microwave was ticking down, I looked over and noticed the plate on the counter. I quick opened up the microwave to see what I had put in there, and it was empty… 

This is when panic set it. (for some back story, when I was pregnant 11 years ago with my son, I ended up with severe preeclampsia, which lead to a mini stroke at 37 weeks. This resulted in an emergency c-section, and I’ve never had issues since!) because confusion and disorientation was a part of my stroke 11 years ago, I started to panic. Which then caused a full blown panic attack.

Could I spread ringworm from one part of my body to the inside of my nose if I scratch it in my sleep and then scratched the inside of my nose?

I’m currently treating a fungal skin infection on my ear with clotramazole and it’s getting better so I’m assuming that’s what it is (I’ve had it on the same location before). 

Lately my allergies have been acting up and my nose tends to get really itchy. 

Recently my nose started to look really dry and red with some skin scaling (similar to what I was experiencing around my ear) on the nostrils and a little bit inside of my nostrils as well.

It’s highly probable that I could have scratch my ear in my sleep as it still itches and then scratched the inside of my nose.

So I’m wondering if it’s possible it has spread there and if I could or should apply the same clotramazole ointment inside my nose. Though on the label it says not to get in there. 

I read online there is something called fungal sinitus and I’m wondering if this could turn into that — it sounds much more serious than a normal fungal skin infection!

Duration of complaint - chronic alcoholism for a few years

Hi docs. I recently relapsed and started drinking regularly again. Typically 5-6 beers a day. But yesterday I drank almost a fifth of whiskey. I felt AWFUL today. Obviously want to quit again ASAP. Today I drank 4 beers spaced out over the day just to avoid shakes pretty much. And about 1 oz of whiskey. That last 1 oz was an hour ago. I still feel really bad. I have chlordiazepoxide 25mg, prescribed to me last time I quit. I know it interacts badly with alcohol.

I don’t want to have seizures but I also don’t want to stop breathing lol. Is it safe for me to take 1 dose yet?

In addition, this leg has had what seems like some kinda claudication (burning pain deep within the outer calf that rarely radiates up the thigh and behind my butt) happening on and off for like a year now, only when walking quickly, sometimes when lifting my legs up on the couch. However, I found the localized spot on the calf where it seems to originate and it hurts like hell when I try to massage it. This has been happening on and off since 2021.

Prior to COVID, I went to the gym and lifted 5 times a week, went for hikes 3 times a week. I don’t smoke or drink. Since COVID (I had it 3 times) I’ve been more sedentary (long COVID), gained some weight but not obese. I’m 27F.

994,AskDocs,"My son is almost 2 (birthday late may) 28lbs, 85th percentile for weight? healthy except for current issue, on amoxicillian and puffers
 
He's been sick since Monday and I took him to the doctor today where they diagnosed him with a double ear infection. The doctor was also concerned about how his lungs sounded but decided against the chest x ray because they were treating the ears with amoxicillian anyway so a positive or negative x ray wouldn't change the antibiotics. 
They also did a throat swab for strep because his tonsils were very red and swollen.

His temp has been high this past week but it goes up and down depending on the time of day, the worse was 40.3 lowest 38.5 It comes down a bit with medications but not fully especially when it's on the higher end. I just checked him and he is 35.8 and hasnt had meds since 2 (6 hours ago). 2 hours ago he was in 38...why is it so low? I've always heard 36 is too low.

He got a single dose of dexamethazone earlier today at 12pm, and is on amoxicillian for 10 days 3x a day (were 2 doses in). He was also given Florent and ventolin as needed.

998,AskDocs,"Thank you so much in advanced.

This test was ordered due to chest pain with activity and while sedentary as well as chronic Shortness of breath.[ sob varies in severity throughout the day, but activities make it worse]
I'm a 30 yo male with history of PEs and t2 diabetes. Incredibly unhealthy diet. I have a addiction to unhealthy food unfortunately.
(If anyone could point me in the right direction to get help with that I'd greatly appreciate it, I was going to ask my doctor on my next visit that I need help with terrible eating habits, if that type of help even exists)
Here is the results of my test.



NM CARDIAC IMAGING MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN MULTIPLE
 
CLINICAL DATA:  Exertional chest pain
 
COMPARISON STUDIES:  Correlation against cardiac CTA, 1/14/2021
 
TECHNIQUE: 25.7 mCi of technetium 99m Sestamibi was injected IV on 4/13/2023 for
the rest study. 26.9 mCi of technetium 99m Sestamibi and 0.4 mg of LexiScan were
also given  for the stress portion of the study on 4/12/2023.
 
Each SPECT/CT tomographic imaging session included 180 degrees of acquisition of
3 degree increments extending from an RAO to the LAO position with the patient
supine. The computer acquired images were gated in synchrony with the patient's
heart rate on electrocardiogram. Computer processing/manipulation yielded the 3
orthogonal tomographic views, polar maps of relative distribution at stress and
rest, and ejection fraction determined by changes in the left ventricular volume
using the gated tomographic slices; gated images were used to construct an
endless cineloop to evaluate left ventricular wall motion.  Low dose CT was
performed for attenuation correction. 
 
FINDINGS: 
Limited provided CT images for attenuation correction demonstrate no significant
incidental findings.
 
Small to moderate fixed anterior wall defect is identified with a larger
reversible component seen extending more laterally and basally.
 
The ejection fraction at rest is 77%. The ejection fraction at stress is 72%.
 
Wall motion at stress and rest is normal. No akinetic or dyskinetic segments
were seen.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Fixed anterior wall defect of small to moderate size compatible with remote
infarct. Additional reversible component seen lateral and basal to this defect,
suspicious for focal inducible ischemia.
2.  Normal ejection fraction at stress and rest.
3.  Normal wall motion at stress and rest.
