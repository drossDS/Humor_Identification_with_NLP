3,AskDocs,"Short history: Began manifesting as what felt  like ""shin splint"", a sharp pain on the outer side of my anterior tibialis that burned when I walked too fast. Some foot drop and plantar fasc symptoms initially. Thought it was anterior tibialis tendonitis, began doing hip strengthening to offset load of my ankles responsible for pronating foot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Went on holiday (I have a desk job) and felt better despite walking MORE than usual? Realised after trawling through youtube that what i'm 90% sure I have is actually an issue with my peroneal nerve. I don't have the shin splint pain right now but a general pain that wraps around my leg and over my ankle similar to how the nerve presents itself. Realised that when i was massaging the hard bit of muscle at the outside top of shin below knee was actually exactly where the peroneal nerve is. **I** **HAD BEEN SITTING CROSS LEGGED AT WORK FOR HOURS ON END FOR MONTH**S - Once I fell asleep cross legged and afterwards legit could not feel or use my foot - most insane dead foot/foot drop/pins and needles for 5-10 minutes before gaining control again.

ANY advice for healing fast as possible? I'm quite confident this is my issue, I am a tennis player and have had to stop training at ALL because I thought i might have a problem with a tendon or muscle but playing sport has NEVER triggered anything - is it ok to resume? I feel disabled right now but the fact it might be a nerve issue makes me feel like its ok to play? I played once a month ago when i had bad symptoms and during play i felt FINE, days following were not great but not necessarily worse.

Hello, I (23M) had a flu about 2 months before. I had continuous cough throughout the night for around two weeks. I was quite careless at that time not checking with a doctor to cure it immediately. After I visited the doctor, my lungs were X-rayed and the doctor said my lungs were infected and had some calcium deficiency. My sputum was tested for TB and the result was negative but the report also said it had ""traces of cocci""(?). Blood report was normal. After analysing, the doctor prescribed some tablets. The coughs disappeared from a few days I started taking the medicines. I kept checking with him for almost a month. The doctor said it might be over now and I thought I was healthy. 

Once the tablets were over and I ran out of that cough syrup, the coughs started again. I can't sleep well. Sometimes I sleep without coughing and if I wake up in the middle coughs start again. They usually start around sunset and mostly disappear in the daytime but they start in the evening again. Why doesn't it stop even after all those medicines ? What should I do ? It worries me what the doctors might say about this.

PS : I never had coughs like this before in my lifetime though I used to get common cold once in a few months. My tonsils were removed when I was around 6 (due to swelling ?

The (alternative med) doc said this spot is in my silicone (under muscle) implant and not to worry, it’s nothing.  I’m having trouble not being concerned. I do have an appointment with a surgeon next week.  

Hoping a doc might be able look at this ultrasound photo and provide some feedback while I await that appointment.

7,AskDocs," For the past 9 months, I've been experienced headaches randomly and a random tingly feeling in my head and I feel kind of light. They usually don't happen at the same time, but a lot of the time if one isn't happening, the other is. It hasn't gotten worse over time, it's been a bit better over time but I don't know why. A lot of the time the headaches are on the right side of my head but sometimes they are just all over. I feel the tingliness when it happens all over in my head and in my arms / legs as well. It almost feels like my brain itches. Sometimes the brain tingles makes it hard to sleep and feels really weird when I try to sleep and kind of removes the tired feeling. These symptoms don't happen every single day, but they are pretty frequent. Another symptom that started is my head starts to feel weird sometimes when I see flashing lights in a show or something. I've gotten blood tests that are normal and a CT scan of the head that was normal.

The right side of my head will sometimes feel warm, and I feel the pain around my eye area as well sometimes when there is pain.

For example, when I get a haircut, afterwards I get a headache. I don't know why but the clippers are rubbing against my hair all day.

Also this didn't started happening after like 6 months and might be completely unrelated but I will randomly get a weird feeling/smell in my nose for like 1 second like once a day.

Since I was diagnosed with CHS, I’ve had significant weight loss. I joined a CHS group and one thing they recommend is magnesium glycinate, about 400 mg daily. I ran this past my PCP and he said it was fine. He also started me on vitamin D. I felt the 400 mg daily may have been effecting me negatively (perhaps making my stomach pain worse) so I reduced to 200. Over the last 2 weeks my legs have ached. It feels like bone pain with muscle twinges.  Heaviness at times, and tingling. I’ve also noticed muscle loss in my thighs. I tried bringing this up with my PCP but he brushed me off and I’m looking for another.

Hi I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with me, I have a doctors appointment this Friday, to back up a bit so im pretty sure I’m lactose I usually take lactaid but I still love my dairy honestly maybe to much!
On to the story! 
My roommate made some Enchiladas on Easter and I tore those things up but my body was not having it I could not control my poops more than anything it was squirts of diarrhea which doesn’t help my situation because a week before Easter I had a really bad constipation bowel movement in the morning where I pushed it out and felt like shards of itchy irritated glass coming out with blood in my stool, so after having those easter enchiladas the following week I been having bloody uncontrollable diarrhea all that week, since then yesterday morning I was a little constipated and pushed out a bloody stool where I flushed it and my anus was leaking blood which made the all the water look like a pool of blood! 
Then I flushed for a second time and I had little dibbles of poop come out with no sign of blood, the same exact thing minus the constipation happen to me this morning as well, i eat one meal a day since I fast and I’m lactose and I eat whatever looks good, I had this same issue last year my doctor told me to add fiber into my diet I did but I was bleeding for a bit still then it stopped but now it’s back which I’m guessing this could really be a fiber issue? 
I’m not going to lie I haven’t been eating much fiber but still I would like to see a GI or something about this especially after seeing all the horror stories on here!

Could be unrelated but i has constant twitching on the right side of my head like if blood flow is having troubling going through and my left arm has like mild nerve pain.

For context I was diagnosed with hypertension years ago, and amblyopia. 

for the past 7 months I have noticed the right side of my face becoming numb. No matter what I do I cannot move this side of my face, and for the longest time it’s always felt this way. 

I went through a stressful period where I lost my house, and I saw online that this is potentially caused by high blood pressure.

Lower Back:
I've been having lower backpains for years. They come and go and are manageable. 

Bloated belly:
Since 3 years my belly started to feel tight. Like there's unusual pressure from the inside? Like a muscle tightness, can't explain it. It also appears A LOT more bloated and I haven't gained that much weight really. 

Breathing issues:
Like a certain stuffiness? I sometimes feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen in but I am? For some reason I think it's connected to the tightness in my belly. 

Pain between shoulder blades/ middle back:
Started getting sort of intense muscle aches between my shoulder blades. Comes and goes. 

Bladder issues:
I feel like there's a pressure on my bladder as well. I have to got to the toilet a lot more than usual. Also, whenever I'm done there's an noticeable amount of leftover urine that comes out when I stand up. Also sometimes I feel like I REALLY have to go, when in fact there's barely any urine coming out. 

Posture:
As comes with lower back pains, I'm having more and more of a hard time sitting up straight at let's say a table. I really have to force my torso to stay straight up and it's exhausting. It creates this tight feeling around the middle of my torso. 

Edit: sometimes when laying down I can REALLY feel my heart beating/blood pumping through my body. It's almost as if I'm nervous, while I'm not. 

Been trying to find out what's causing all this but many tests later doctors still haven't found anything. Took a break for having tests done but I'm still in pain and discomfort.

Hi,   

Background: 33yr old male.  Have Ulcerative Colitis so I’m on a drug called Infliximab every 6 weeks. Haven’t had a flare since I started the meds 3 yrs ago. I have gHSV-2 and take valtrex once a day. Otherwise I’m fit and healthy with good diet and sleep habits.   

Post: I keep getting these reoccurring red lumps on my index finger. They start off as small red lumps then grow in size over a couple of weeks.  At the start they’re really itchy. Then once they grow they seem to get painful to touch.  They feel like how blisters would feel but I don’t see them fill up the way a blister would. They just go red and bigger then over about 3 weeks they go away on their own.   

Anyone know what this could be?

I've been waking up daily for the past few days (3 ) with something like sudden alertness, and sometimes chest pains/arm pains. I have a portable BP machine and an oxymetre, so I've been testing my BP/HEART RATE AND SpO2 levels during those moments of shock. 1st night was really bad with 150 heart rate and about 145/110 Blood pressure, the 2nd night was better with 90 bpm with 130/90 pressure. Today, I hit 75 bpm with 135/90 BP.

23,AskDocs,"I'll try to keep this concise but brevity isn't my strong suit. 

I'm a 31 year old white female, 5'6'' and regretfully 170lbs. I have rheumatoid arthritis, IBS and hidradenitis suppurativa. I was on a once weekly oral dosage of trexall and it's friends in 2019, but we elected to stop the treatment because I felt more side effects than relief, my bloodwork wasn't showing as expected and at the time, we were unsure if I'd be able to get the COVID mRNA vaccine if I continued. I was on humira for about 4 months but didn't find it effective. There's been talk of combining humira and the methotrexate, but that's yet to happen. I take THC tinctures every day right now with my pain meds. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 5+ years and have been sober from alcohol for 6 months. 

I'm used to pain. I had a traumatic childhood with an abusive parent, so I admit I'm slow to seek assistance with certain things but this is the first time something has been reoccurring and actually scares me, yet care providers don't really seem to care and I'm wondering if it's indicative of something bigger. 

Two years ago, I started randomly (like, 1-2x every 6-8 months) getting these attacks. I used to tow, so the only way I can describe it is like someone is using a towing skate or a wedge and they're slowly driving it between my ribs on my back, close to my spine. It starts in my back and then opens up in my chest - like someone is trying to do the same thing, but through my chest too. Like they're trying to tear me in half and meet in the middle. The pain is intense, it gets worse when I bend over but not better if I lay down. My instinct is always to get up and move around. I get dizzy, light headed and hot. The first two or three times, I just laid down on my kitchen tile and tried to breathe through it so I didn't have a panic attack. 

Then, it happened in the middle of the day when I was at work but the pain was so intense it climbed up my neck and into my jaw. I couldn't unclench my jaw. The pain got so bad I was having problems seeing and forming words. I had a coworker drive me to the ER. I can't remember my blood pressure but they took it and then admitted me for an EKG. I waited for a few hours and saw a doctor, who did a physical exam and an ultrasound on my chest and found nothing remarkable. He had a resident in there and they left and returned with a third, who introduced himself as an ER specialist. 

They seemed to think at that point that I had suffered a 'muscular spasm'. The third ER doc wanted to feel through my back and claimed that sometimes spasms are caused by 'things being where they shouldn't be'. They felt my back and seemed to find something just under my scapula, towards my spine. He felt it, got the other two to feel it and then asked me if he could 'try a quick fix'. Desperate to not risk feeling that pain anymore, I said he could do whatever he wanted. So, he told me that even if it hurts not to flail and they started to hold my legs and arms down. At this point, my husband had to stand in the corner of the room and hold on to the counter because he didn't trust himself to not try to stop the way they crushed me. He swears he heard a crunching noise, but I don't remember anything other than being crushed a bit. Then, they asked if I felt better and while I was still in pain it wasn't the emergent pain that had brought me in, it was more a super-sore-after-pain. 

They told me that I likely 'slipped a rib' and it being out of position caused a spasm. I don't play contact sports, the last car accident I was in was 7 years ago, I don't have a strenuous job anymore. We went through all the options before they just said some people are prone to it. (???) They said it could have been out of position for 'months' and I sincerely don't understand how I wouldn't notice such a major rib being 'out of position'. 

My back hurt for almost 3 weeks after they did their thing. The pain didn't happen again for an entire year until it recently started in minor episodes again, just this time it starts by my sternum and not my spine. I definitely have not done anything likely to 'slip a rib' in between then and now and no amount of my husband feeling my back is feeling anything wrong? 

My GP does not care and prefers to discuss my anxiety when I bring it up, which I feel incredibly invalidating. Then I get confused because if it was in my head, what the fuck did they find and crunch in my back? Why did it seem to help? Could it have something to do with the fact that my bra size is a 34I? I've asked if my breast size could be contributing and have been told I can look into 'posture correctors'. My sister underwent spinal fusion in 2021 at 21 (abusive parent meant medical neglect) for severe scoliosis, having 3 rods and 13 pins put in but to my knowledge, there's never been anything questionable about my spine. My brother had osgood-schlatter disease and has hyperhidrosis amongst a host of other problems he simply ignores. My sister's surgeon commented that between the three of us a compelling case could be made for a collagen disorder, but he didn't want to elaborate and said our family presentation is less compelling than our individual presentations, which was incredibly frustrating to hear. 

I'm terrified of experiencing this pain again. I've got chronic pain, have broken quite a few bones in my life and deal daily with various pains so I feel ridiculous being so pain avoidant but I absolutely don't want to go through that again. My GP is dismissive and would prefer to talk about anxiety and arthritis and how I could be experiencing pain fatigue but will not listen when I say there's something different about this. 

I feel like they're waiting for me to die before they'll admit there's something else wrong. 

The health system is so overworked, I feel dumb pursuing the issue further considering I get more medical attention than most people do in general but this problem isn't solved for me and now I live in fear of this pain coming back or somehow randomly slipping ribs while I'm existing. Is this something I should be pursuing? Are they right and I'm being hyper sensitive? I've had success treating my HS with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% and noticed little difference in my arthritis, so I requested to be taken off Humira and I'm wondering if I've been branded a difficult patient because of that. My doctor wasn't thrilled that I'd 'experimented with over-the-counter solutions' but I didn't see how a wound wash was unnecessarily hokey. Does this rib explanation even make sense or am I having smoke blown up my ass? 

Sorry, I'm trying to make sense of what's happening and consider myself rather informed for someone who isn't medical personnel, but there's very little on the internet that tracks with what I've been told, getting another opinion is like a 6 month wait, this isn't something a clinic doc or ER doc can help with and it feels like my doctor is only treating what he wants to treat.

Newer symptoms include swelling in fingers, face, ankles, hands, arms feel like 50 lb weights. Body aches competitive to whiplash pain. Headache, very drowsy, nauseated, CONFUSION, easily agitated. 

When sleep does occur it is between 7-15 straight hours. I just woke up from sleeping nearly 16 hours. It wasn’t straight through. I had woken up for the day but got dizzy and tried to rest a few minutes to shake it off. Fell asleep for another 6 solid hours and still feel like I could sleep 10 more. Eyes are heavy daily almost like there are weights attached to the lids. 

I am not nor have I ever been someone who naps or wastes this much time resting. I don’t understand what is causing this. 

No matter what amount, it still feels like I could continue sleeping for the remainder of the day. 

No appetite but I am forcing myself a meal a day. Once that’s eaten, I feel incredibly sick almost like it’s sitting like a brick in my stomach and my stomach acid wants to reject it one way or another. 


I have a fairly healthy diet and try to be a conscious eater so this started about 3x months ago, or actually may have been around November &amp; October when that started. I know the lack of appetite is contributing to my weakness but everytime I eat I also feel so weak if I don’t lay down right off I will start to “see stars” and get the feeling I will faint any moment. 

Purchased a Blood pressure monitor last week suspecting I may have low BP. 

This was after realizing it’s been months of having extreme difficulty doing basic tasks like cooking or showering- I will start to feel like the blood has drained from my body and get really wobbly. 

I should add another symptom is constantly feeling dizzy, rocking chairs will make me vomit. If I get nudged it feels like I’m on a boat in the high seas for moments afterward. 


Readings are coming out low- 85/63, 96/65, 102/75. 

What could be causing this?

I am so weak and beyond tired all of the time that I feel like I haven’t truly lived for months. This is obviously beginning to affect my mental health as I’m a passionate about nature type of gal and have been too weak to even catch my mail, let alone walks and hikes.

31,AskDocs,"I am a 33 year old, healthy male. I’m 6’2 and 195 pounds. I have had it for about a week or so. It doesn’t hurt or itch. There’s no oozing and it’s not really raised. It doesn’t hurt to urinate and I have no discharge. 

I thought maybe it was friction burn? So I put hydrocortisone cream on it and covered it with a band aid the last day or two but that could’ve made it worse? 

I did a teledoc appointment and she prescribed me Nystatin as she believes it could be fungal(I thought maybe molluscum) she said she didn’t think so. Any additional inside is appreciated as I am a hypochondriac.

Now in the past month or so I’ve noticed my stomach below my belly button is puffier and flabbier. I have lots of loose skin but I know the difference between skin and fat. I remember having visceral fat around my waist and know what it feels like. I am 18 pounds heavier than I was 3 months ago. My stomach has only started getting noticeably fatter in the past month. I am always very bloated. I have been eating at a -500 calorie deficit well below my BMR for the past 6 months, so it’s impossible for there to be extra calories to turn into fat. I have read articles about how people that restrict calories’ metabolisms slow down and adjust to the amount of food they get, which lowers their BMR and they get fat when they eat normally again. Is it possible that my body isn’t using all the calories I eat for energy, rather storing them as fat and depriving my other bodily functions of energy? I went to talk to a doctor today and tried to ask them why this is happening but she refused to give me an answer, instead talking about how I need fat to live.

35,AskDocs,"Hello. So about a year ago I started experiencing some extreme fatigue mainly in the evenings and as soon as I would wake up. Getting up out of bed felt nearly impossible and my whole upper body just felt so extremely heavy. It got to where to was happening most of the day. It really peaked at the most stressful period of my life. After that was over the fatigue seemed to have disappeared for almost half a year until recently it has appeared again. I’ve dealt with health anxiety and insomnia and my insomnia appears to disappear when this fatigue comes in because I become so tired at night, but they don’t seem to be linked as the tiredness/fatigue I get from lack sleep is different than this fatigue and I sleep hard night after night with no changes in the fatigue. At this point I feel like it could be mental health related? I’ve been so worried it could be the C word. I’ve spent a lot of money on doctor visits due to this and some other post Covid issues and am honestly so fed up at this point with going to the dr as it just seems like a waist of money. I’m a 29 year old male that works out/lifts heavy weights 5 times a week. Some of the tests I’ve had over the past year include basic blood tests, EKG, echocardiogram, stress test, chest X-ray,PFT, holter monitor, and colonoscopy due to IBS like symptoms.

So since a couple months (maybe 5 or 4) i have had these weird sensations/feelings around my temple area. My right side is significantly and seems to also effect the lower eyelid and part of my eyebrow.  
I also have floaters which again, effect my right eye more.  


It feels like there is some pressure on the right side, almost like something needs to be stretched or something. I thought this was a jaw issue at first so i went to the doctor and they did say something was up and gave me some exercises to do. These did not work however and it seems like it only got worse.  


I keep trying to move every muscle in my face: Moving my eyebrows, squinting my eyes real hard, moving my jaw around, biting down, stretching my neck, Moving my eyes around, moving my forhead muscles. Every time i do this i feel these small movements under my skin, almost like something is stretching/moving/snapping. This doesnt hurt however and is closer to some sort of tingling/web like sensation.   


It also apears like a muscle in my eyebrow is not moving at all. When i raise it i can see this little dent form in my hand and disapear slowly as other muscles seem to be putting it in its place. Its in the middle of my eyebrow and right at the same place i can feel something under my skin. Its on the other side aswell but its smaller. Maybe an inflammed nerve or artery???

  
Most days im tired, i have no energy and this effects every aspect of my life. I almost feel like this is somesort of MS, but my doc keeps it at anxiety and jaw issues.  
I don't take medication, i do take drugs sometimes, (mostly stimulants). I sit alot and my posture is not good, but i don't think this is a posture issue cause nothing changes.

40,AskDocs,"47-year-old active c-7 quadriplegic female. Manual chair user. 
Was infirm for a few months from gastritis + hypotension. Have existing tear on left shoulder but manageable. Was told I ""probably have one on the right side too"" from overuse. When the gastritis began to subside and I had energy I started doing things as normal. But my right side pain had been increasing over 3 months. 

I think driving a couple times is what finally did it. Hand controls. For two weeks I felt a tear at the top of my shoulder and my entire subscap was fire and ice and a hard boulder. The muscle going across my armpit to my chest was a thick rope and my armpit felt like it had been backfilled with crushed rock. Sore muscles, inflammation and nerve pain crept down my lats, across my rib cage front and back and under my breast. Jumped over to right side a couple times. Felt like someone slashed my back. Real raw.

I do a lot of transfers and ambulate in bed by pushing my arms down and swinging my butt over or forward or backward. Been doing a lot of repetitive motions for 4 months and only 50% of my exercises. I prop up on my elbows a lot in bed and to get from prone to sitting up I get on my elbows and push up with one arm then the other. 

For 2 painful weeks I avoided pushing up the normal way (rolling my right shoulder) and switched sides. Last night after taking a lot of drugs including ibuprofen, I sat up the way I had been avoiding and something happened. Something rolled and when I laid on my back all the muscular pain, inflammation, tight muscles and nerve pain subsided like someone flipped a switch. 

Could it be that for 3 months I got so weak that using my hand controls driving (using my right arm on a swivel mechanism on the steering wheel) could have popped it out of alignment, at least somewhat, and I accidentally popped it back in after doing the limited strengthening I could and taking ibuprofen?

I went to a shoulder doc in the beginning and his tech took an x-ray he saw that my right shoulder looked like it was higher but shrugged his shoulders and said he wasn't sure whether it wasnt the way I was positioned because I had to lean to the side in my wheelchair for x-rat. 
I really wanted to know why the tear was happening at the same time as the increase in subscapular pain but he looked at me like I was asking stupid questions. Now I'm pretty sure I know. I think the tear was already there and the dislocation made everything angry and feed off of each other.

I'm upset that I had so much pain to the point of some mild dissociation for two weeks for something that seems to have a common fix but I know all I need to do is strengthen now.

I understand the first opinion regarding the hemangioma and potential tiny cysts, but can someone explain what the radiologist means by a diffusely increased marrow signal? 

FINDINGS:
There is a strongly T2 bright and T1 mildly hypointense lesion in the right hepatic lobe near the junction between segments V and VI centrally near the IVC. This measures up 1.6 x 1.5 cm with peripheral discontinuous nodular enhancement post IV contrast administration compatible with a hepatic hemangioma. There is a tiny T2 hot hyperintense focus too small to characterize in segment VIll of the liver measuring about 0.2 cm S5-11 likely representing either tiny cyst or hemangioma.

There is no evidence of upper abdominal ascites. Portions of the kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, gallbladder and spleen included on the examination are unremarkable.

Marrow signal diffusely mildly increased on diffusion weighted images although there is no significant marrow edema seen on these water sensitive sequences.

My dissertation (already extended by 6 weeks) isn’t finished even though it’s due this week and I have an essay and exam I need to do as well. My Mum has been having cognitive issues (they don’t think it’s dementia but she needs a second MRI) and my Grandad has just had his third load of cancer removed. I’m barely hungry, I live off of microwave meals because I don’t have the headspace to cook. My stomach hurts a lot, especially if I wear clothes that put pressure on my waist. My head hurts. I can’t sleep. I’m tired by 8pm but I can’t sleep until 3am. Recently I’ve only been able to fall asleep by crying until I’m exhausted but I only sleep 5-6 hours and I wake up every hour.

49,AskDocs,"Hi all,

M20 here. My girlfriend (F20), missed her period this cycle. At the time of writing, it is 9 days late. We are confident that it is due to stress, as she has been incredibly stressed with university work recently as we have a high volume of difficult assignments. Since missing her period she has taken three pregnancy tests, three days apart, all of which have tested negative. 

However, 4 before her period was due, a condom broke on us (there was no cum, but potentially precum). We chose not to take the pill, as she was concerned about the effect of the pill on her body (she took it twice last month), and the risk of anything happening felt low, as it broke on entry and we stopped immediately (in hindsight we both regret this). 

A week after her period was due, a second condom broke, and after talking to the non-emergency number in the UK (111), they could only advise us to continue doing pregnancy tests, and said that they could not prescribe the morning after pill, as they cannot be sure she is not pregnant. 

Today another one broke on insertion, and we are not sure whether we should/should not take the pill, or really what we should do. We are also aware that this is a rather high rate of condom breakages and are looking into that too. 

We have tracked  two of her cycles (one of 30 days, the other of 27, and her period normally lasts for around a week).

56,AskDocs,"Okay so this is going to be a long post. My brain is currently fucking the shit out of me. I'm a female 23yo. The last time I had any piv was back at the very start of January. There were two instances where first was oral and the second was was piv with condom. As far as I know, i used it correctly.

A few days later i had this weird itch around the skin between my thighs and pubic area. Like the crevices? I blamed it on the recent shaving and just applied loads of baby powder.
It was weird for it keep on going.

So cut to January, i got my periods normally by mid Jan and I was relaxed, atleast no pregnancy.
A week after that, I went away on trip to a humid area. Gone for a week or two.
Came back and intense fever. Blamed on the holiday.

Now we enter February. Everything's going normal, i get a gew instances of itch again. Didn't pay heed.
My periods started behaving a bit wonky. I get random spotting for two three days and then i get my periods which hasn't happened before.

Cut to March, i come back to live with my parents because of a massive financial issue. Get spotting for 5-6 days and then start periods full blown for 6-9 days. Periods lasted till April first week.
 Mind you I'm still getting itching symptoms, seems to worsen at night?.
Then i though oh it could be a fungal rash, started using candid. Used it for a few days before getting my periods in March, but wasn't consistent.
Itch came back.

Currently as I type this, I've been having massive abdominal cramps, severe bloating even without eating anything, Itching (been applying candid cream and powder religiously since the days now) and just genuinely scared to my very core about everything.
Now when tracking my cycle this looks like the ovulation time, so some cramps should be normal but Idk haven't had such intense cramps before. Usually i get very bad cramps during my periods but not during ovulation 

A few things. I live a less active life since starting off with the desk job, i try to get a few thousand steps in everyday.
My cycles are fairly consistent with 35-38 days.
Apart from the above mentioned symptoms I haven't had any vaginal discharge apart from the usual, no foul smell or burning while I pee.


I'm genuinely scared of all of these symptoms together and dying with anxiety of every possible STD/ condition I can find online. And even AIDS
I am currently absolutely stuck with very strict parents so going to get things tested hasn't been possible. I'm actively looking for a window to get the tests done but the place where I live is extremely conservative and there's a massive risk of this information leaking and reaching to my parents.
I know by the end of it testing is the only way to understand but I'm just dying with anxiety. Also to mention. There has a been an extremely stressful situation at the start of this month which has shit my stress levels off the chart as well.

My first one was in the waiting room at the hospital. I started to feel a little light-headed; common symptom of POTS. However, I was sitting down at the time. Then I started to tremor and shake. The lower half of my body became weak and numb. I started to feel icy cold; my skin became pale and blue tinged. I told the nurse at the time and she rushed me into a room.

There she checked my vitals; heart-rate was in the just hitting 100 but everything else was fine! She also did my blood sugar and it was 2. something? This was a few hours after eating. I can't remember exactly. (these are UK measurements)

After she got me a snack and I lay down for a while these symptoms slowly subsided. This was then followed with me warming up and getting some color back to my skin. The shaking stopped after a few hours; The dizziness persisted for a few days.

I thought this may have been a one-off thing, but today I went out grocery shopping and it happened again. I had to rush and get a taxi home as I felt so unwell. By the time I got home I could barely stand and my hands looked blue. I ate some snacks and lay down all evening. Now I am feeling better; still weak and dizzy but I can move around now!

19M. 6'0"" White, Condition: Chronic Sinusitis, Medications: Omeprazole and Steroid Nasal Rinse

Since summer of 2021, I have been having symptoms that have really been diminishing the quality of my life. In that summer, I woke up randomly one morning on vacation with a tired feeling that I have not been able to shake. It is primarily a tiredness/heaviness of my eyes, not whole body, as well as a pressure over my sinus region.  I developed the sinus pressure and pain about two weeks after having the tired feeling, and this progressed until I had endoscopic sinus surgery in December of 2021.  I have gone through surgery and done allergy medications(and shots), and nothing has improved to the point I was prior to the onset of symptoms. Primarily, I have extremely tired eyes that make me want to sleep everyday and often get worse after being up for an hour or so(I am still able to make it through a long day). Additionally, I have noticed that entering brightly lit and stimulating areas triggers the eye tiredness and yawning, and I always feel as though my eyes are not able to focus or are overwhelmed(I get light-headed sometimes and can't concentrate), but this feeling still is noticeable even on days when I am in a calm area like my house. I am able to exercise pretty intensely and wake up the next day relatively in the similar condition as the day prior(at one point I was running 3-4 miles a day trying to improve my condition). Additionally, as odd as it may sound, I have noticed that times when I am sick and my nose produces large amount of mucus, I feel better, both energy-wise and eye-wise in brightly lit areas(better concentration). I am being referred to a neurologist and was wondering what I should bring up as a possibility for what I am experiencing. My ENT says that none of my issues now can be related to my condition of Chronic Sinusitis.  I am pretty scared that my situation might be a form of CFS or another neurological issue which I won't get relief from. I have been having this problem constantly for about two years straight. This situation has been detrimental on my life as I have went from an energetic and active 18 year old to a sluggish and fatigued 19 year old in the matter of a day and this has persisted for now almost two years. Any advice would be appreciated, whether that be directions I should take with my ENT or Neurologist, as well as what you believe may be going on.",t2_k9fqomoi,0,Issues with Fatigue and Sinuses since 2021,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12r5wf2,True,No_Amoeba9961,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12r5wf2/issues_with_fatigue_and_sinuses_since_2021/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12r5wf2/issues_with_fatigue_and_sinuses_since_2021/,475715,1681854896,0,,False,1681854915,1681854916,2023-04-18 21:54:56,,,

64,AskDocs,"25F, no history of heart disease in the family, history of anxiety

I went to the doctor a month ago for my check up and mentioned to her I was having more panic attacks that were shooting my heart rate up super high. I’d seen 180 on my smart watch. She decided to order a 48hr Holter and it came back okay. All the testing scared me and my anxiety was worse than ever after having the test and awaiting results. 

About 2 weeks ago I started noticing my heart rate more in my neck. The rhythm isn’t off and the beats don’t feel like extra beats, I can just feel some beats and my heart feels like it’s beating harder I guess. It feels like pressure in my head and neck. This will happen whether my heart is beating slowly (54) or quicker (80s-90s). It doesn’t happen all the time. It’s sporadic. I talked to my doctor about it a week ago who sent me to a cardiologist to have him review my Holter. 

I went to see him and he looked at my Holter results, blood work and some EKGs(including one in his office) and listened to my heart and said my heart was just fine. I explained about these weird sensations in my neck and he thinks I’m just “wired” to be overly aware of them and not to worry. 

My only concern is that I’ve never had these sensations during an EKG or Holter. He’s just assuming it’s me being hyper aware but I’ve always been hyper aware of my bodily sensations and I’m only just now feeling these. Should I go back to him and request an Echo and maybe another Holter or just chock it up to anxiety (even though it doesn’t happen when I’m anxious) like he said?

67,AskDocs,"I am a 23 year old who has been male presenting all my life. That’s largely due to the fact that my Uterus has been tucked inside of me, torn apart and growing like a tumor. The rest of my body has been trying to grow like a woman, but my brain and thyroid are not turning any testosterone into estrogen. My Immune System has gotten angry at this, trying to attack the testosterone in the body. The running theory is that I absorbed my twin (Sorry baby brother, I got hungi). This has led to a cascade of symptoms that have not been diagnosed until now (thanks for not finding the goddamn uterus by the way Mayo Clinic, appreciate that). 

If this goes untreated for much longer, I will die. I am getting rapidly worse. 

TO BE CLEAR; I HAVE ALREADY BEEN DIAGNOSED. This is weird and this is strange - I know. My doctors said it was a miracle I was still alive. That being said - their hands are tied due to higher powers in government and the medical board. My condition (although a clear physical issue) is being considered that of a trans person. I fully support trans rights - but I am not trans. Because of this classification, I can not receive immediate treatment until I do the following.

1. See a psychiatrist to make sure I want to transition. I am not trans.
2. See two different therapists to confirm I want to transition and make sure I am right of mind. I am not trans. (And in case you were wondering, no the mental state isn’t particularly great).
3. I have to start HRT. This is a dual purpose - not only do you have to begin with HRT before major gender affirming care where I’m at, but they are scared what will happen to me if they do the risky surgeries and I have no hormones afterwards. Even just starting HRT could buy me much needed time however, although there could be complications. I’ll get into the specifics later on in this post.
4. We begin prep for the surgery about 6 months out. My doctors have not fully relayed to me what this process is except that I will need to be very healthy for what’s to come.
5. Surgery. My uterus is blown apart - not intact. They think it might have blown apart when I was younger. (I went to the hospital a few times when I was around 13-14 for severe stomach pains; which could be why it’s torn apart. Yes - the hospital did ultrasounds. Yes - they saw that my appendix was higher than it should be. No - they did not look anywhere else or catch the uterus.) The uterus wall has grown into several parts of my intestine lining, along with wrapping around the penile tube. Not only do they have to expertly remove the uterus and part of my intestine lining - but I have to have full bottom surgery ***at the same time***. This surgery is incredibly dangerous, and the longer I wait the worse it gets. They want my body dependent on estrogen by this point so that when I come out of surgery I’m not suffering from a hormone deficiency along with a colostomy bag and a very invasive surgery. 
6. I have to figure out who the hell I am again. I have never really fit in and I even thought I was non-binary or trans, but I am not. I am two bodies combined into one. I am sick and dying.

The reason I am making this post is because I do not know where to go or what to do. I am looking at a timeline of anywhere between 1 ½ years to 3 years before I can get the surgery I need. The doctors said they will be surprised if I live to see my 24th birthday. There is a lot I simply don’t know - and I have several questions.

* Are there any US loopholes to start HRT early?
* Are there any places out of the US recommended for HRT and intense surgeries such as this one?
* Where are medical procedures of this scale cheapest?
* I am also scared that with the direction US laws are heading that I will still be seen as a trans person and will be in danger. Where are good back up places to move to in-case of the worst?

Again - I know this is strange. I know it does not make sense, and I know a lot of people on here will not believe me. That’s okay. I am staying anonymous for a reason. All I ask is for any insight or help I might be able to get.

My little brother (M13) has suddenly been coughing very frequently per minute (the past few weeks). He has been to the doctor and the doctor said it could be a tic. I've researched it and I guess it can fall under the title ""tic cough"". He is going to an ENT in a couple of weeks. 

He's never had to deal with tics before, and this has genuinely been causing me anxiety. I hear him coughing all day long and I'm struggling to know what to do and how to navigate it.

He has no coughing when he's in bed ready for sleep, when he's sleeping, or when he's engaged and distracted. 

I've been trying to keep him distracted but this is also taking an emotionally exhausting toll on me.

9 days ago I noticed while sleeping breathing would feel different, like it was harder to breathe. It felt weird to me, I didn’t understand if it was something with my nose, throat or chest. It persisted, I still have it but it is mostly at night. Sometimes I felt it during the day too. Most of the times I am okay during the day.

Today for the last 1 hour I’ve been feeling like that but a bit worse. I feel like I don’t automatically breathe. I feel like crying. I am alone. My throat feels tight. I got nauseous thinking about the fact that maybe I am having a heart attack but nausea passed after I calmed down. I still feel really weird though. I also checked my hear rate and it seems normal, maybe a bit faster.

When do I go to doctor? At one point I feel like this is anxiety related but also feels weird, I don’t know what triggers it and why it occured last week suddenly. I’ve been going through rough days and was very sad for a while. Eating horrible food. Maybe related?

If I go to the doctor, which speciality doctor and what do I say? How will they understand if it’s heart related/anxiety related, is it easy?

Sometimes when shifting my weight it wants to lock or collapse depending (it doesn't want to hold weight while slightly bent). My right hip is starting to ache as well due to compensating for it.

Some backstop to all this to give a better idea. When I was around 11 or 12 I had my first panic attack I guess? It caused my left arm to get tingly and numb and made my left side of the body feel ""weird"" if that makes sense. Then after that happened, I noticed my thinking/ mental ability was lessened. I didnt have the same quickness or future sight (like I could have planned out an entire conversation with someone and all the possible routes it could go) but afterwards my mind felt ""empty"" and didn't have a bunch of thoughts l going on.

Obviously I went to the dcotors and got told it's anxiety or stress and then started seeing a counselor. That didn't fix any of my physical or mental symptoms. So I just learned to live with it

Fast forward to when I was like 21? And it happened again but this time my other side. So I went to the ER and they checked if I had a stroke because my symptoms sounded very stroke like but they decided it wasn't. They did a blood test and nothing looked wrong. So I went to see a neurologist and from there I got a MRI, which came back normal, and did some psychological testing (like puzzles, reading comprehension, motor skill testing) and those came back fine.

So I learned to live with it again. I recently got on anti depressants and those helped with my emotional problems. But recently it happened again with my right side. I suddenly had a reduced sense of feeling in my right side and my mental ability took a small dive. There was a moment where I had trouble reading and my thinking skills/thoughts got really cloudy and unclear.

I’ve always had issues with vaginal pain and horrible cramps, and my cortisol dosing is normal for me (I do 10mg at 9am and 5mg at 2pm, double afternoon when needed sometimes on period since otherwise I’ll get very fatigued and painful and may go into crisis)

My period will fully come and fully go both times. The first time it’ll last a week, second time 4-6 days. 
As a kid they thought I had a vaginal septum, I didn’t but I do have a shortened vagina. They also told me that my hole is smaller than others. I had it “stretched” once under anaesthesia.

From previous exams / ultrasounds though, the only thing they’ve noticed is the shortened vagina and I believe a few cysts. 

I know it could probably be due to hormonal issues or stress, but it is exhausting me so much. My cramps are horrible and I can barely move. 

PS: with my vaginismus, my cramps actually are in my vagina as well. I get a burning pain whenever I’m on my period, and any kind of penetration whether it’s a q tip or a finger feels like a shard of glass that’s on fire.

For the past three years, I've been having these episodes of foot pain that just start out of nowhere.  There's no injury or traumatic event precipitating these episodes, I'll just wake up one day and the pain is there.  Or I'll wake up and be perfectly fine and the pain will start sometime throughout the day.  I work from home, sitting at a desk 99% of the time, not anything labourious that would strain my feet.

I've had a dozen or so episodes in the past three years.  Sometimes, I'm pain-free for a few months, but there was a span of over a year where I didn't have a single episode.  They begin randomly and unpredictably, but the pain profile is quite consistent.

 - each episode typically last 1-3 weeks and the pain level can fluctuate greatly during that period (some days, it's almost gone, other days it's raging)
 - it's a static pain (not throbbing) along the outside edge of one or both of my feet, from my heel to my small toe
 - occasionally, with or without pain, I will feel a tingling sensation in the exact area where the pain always occurs
 - it always starts at a 1 and will escalate over a period of hours or days
 - if I treat it immediately with an NSAID (400mg Ibuprofen or 50mg Diclofenac) and continue OD or BID (depending on the pain level) for the duration of the episode, it will stem the pain level at about 3-5 until the episode clears
 - if I ignore for even just a few hours after it starts, the NSAID's can never catch up and it will escalate to a 10 (lying in bed, sweating and writhing in agony with no weight on the foot at all)

I've seen two GP's, had three x-days, an MRI, and EMG.  All of them show nothing anatomically wrong with my feet and nerve function.  The latest appt (EMG), doc suggested I try treating it as musculoskeletal pain (physio, orthotics, wearing footwear indoors, etc.), but to be honest, I sensed he was just trying to give me the best advise he could without a clear diagnosis, because it really doesn't feel like muscle pain.

96,AskDocs,"26F, 5'3, 155lbs. takes zyrtec daily 10mg. Former cig smoker, quit Dec 2022. Used to smoke 1 cig a day or per week, on and off use. Moderate alcohol use, less than 3 drinks/week. 

In January after partying on dec 31st, I noticed I had some rash on my right breast that did not itch or had pus. It just looked like whiteheads that were slowly spreading. On top of this, I noticed my right neck was swollen. Didnt feel any bumps or my lymph nodes, just the muscle area (not sure what its called) was swollen. No sore throat feeling or fever. And then, my right underarm got swollen. I already have a fatty lipoma in the same armpit so thought that was maybe pressing on something that was causing soreness and pain/discomfort. 

I make an appointment at the clinic and say I have to wait until March. After observing for one month and seeing no decrease in my symptoms, I went to urgent care. The doctor did some blood test and said she thinks my rash and swollen neck/armpit is not related and that I should see a dermatologist and do an x-ray of my neck. The blood test was done to see any infections, thyroid problems, lupus, and liver and kidney function. All came back normal. 

Dermatologist also has no idea and tells me that I should apply hydrocortisone. I applied and it started to fade away but other symptoms are still present. 

March comes around and At this point, I developed even more symptoms. My throat started to hurt, I looked at them with a flashlight and noticed bumps on my right side, hurts to swallow, lots of neck stiffness, and ear pain. The swelling on the neck is still there. On top of this, the area right under my left breast, around my upper ribs, I feel some swelling there and it was hurting from time to time. The chest area on my right breast right next to the lipoma in my underarm that I mentioned feels bigger than my left side, and from time to time it hurts to breathe. I get a sharp pain in my upper right chest and the slightest activity triggers days-long soreness and pain. 

I finally saw the doctor at the clinic that I've been waiting for at the end of March, he looked at my neck, felt it for lymph nodes, and said he didn't feel anything but didnt look at my throat and said its just the muscle soreness. He pressed on my rib area and again said he didnt feel any swelling but ordered a breath test that ended up coming back positive for H Pylori. For my lipoma, he told me to go see a general surgeon to remove it. I just finished my 2 weeks of antibiotics + pump inhibitor drug. If anything, the pain in my rib area only gotten worse! Everything is getting worse - my throat hurts more and more everyday, my lipoma or whatever is swelling the area nearby - chest, underarm, behind arm and sometimes when I breathe, my upper shoulder blade/back has sharp pain as well as my chest. I am in SO much pain and this has been on for 4 months. I don't have insurance so I can't be going to the doctor every week.

97,AskDocs,"This situation happened multiple times already, my dad goes about 2 times a week to play hockey  (sometimes more sometimes less depens on his schedule) he's in really good physical condition for his age, he's in his mid 50's but if you didnt saw his face you could easily mistake him for being in late 30's

A lot of times he comes from hockey beat up and things hurt and he had injuries + (he broke soem bones couple of times) [and yes he is wearing all the protective gear I think Its just the nature  of the game especialy at not profesional level]


The problem is that sometimes he comes hoem from hockey, and the injury is eeally bad like arm looks deformed swelled he cant move it properly only in very small way, its hurts like hell. Or when he came from hockey and had to go up stairs on four because his legs hurt so much.

I always try to pursue him to call albulance, he says that ambulance qouldnt came from him that he would have to go to hospital on his own, I ask him why he doesnt go and he always awnsers  by saying something like:
""I can go tommorov if the pain gets worse.""
Wich I get he doesnt want to go to hospital wait there for a long time just to go home after 3 hours with just doctors find him not having broken or fratured anything. 
(We are in pretty good financial state and are in Europe so I dont think he is trying to hide being embares that hospital is too expensive or somethjg like that, i dont think thats the problem)

I try to saying to him that it could be a critical time to go that something very bad could happen if he waits.

But he responds with saying that it doesnt matter or something like that and closes the conversation.

Is there a good way to diagnose some bad injury from something that will be ok? I tried looking online and it seems that every symptom for serous injury could still be just a  hit to arm and nothing that wont heal in couple of weeks.

Is he just right to not go to hospital and waiting?
If not how should I pursue him?/what should I do?

I take 40mg Omeprazole daily and I’m currently weaning my sertraline down (started at 150mg, now at 50mg) to switch over to Prozac. I am 5’2 and 165 lbs. I stopped my depo birth control shot recently (last dose in September) and have not yet had my periods return. 

Last night around 3am, I woke up to my dog getting out of bed and noticed a slight cramping pain in my lower right abdomen. (3 inches to the right of my naval and 2 inches below). The pain was intermittent and not intense so I figured it was gas pain and went back to sleep. Not unusual for me.

I woke up and took my dog outside, still noticing the same dull ache/cramp in my LRQ here and there but not concerned at this point. Then I took a shower and noticed it got worse, the pain still periodic but more frequent and longer durations (anywhere from 2-15 seconds) and becoming sharper pain. I drove to an appointment and the pain was again sharp and almost burning in my LRQ, nothing like I have felt before, but still intermittent. I can also feel it in my lower back, more of an ache. 

I have been urinating as normal and had a BM this morning, as well as trying my best to pass gas, but nothing has helped and the pain has not moved from that location. 

The pain is still intermittent and not severe, but it’s enough to make me wince. I have not had any nausea and it does not hurt to the touch. It has crossed my mind that it could be my period returning, but no bleeding so far and the pain is sharper/definitely localized to my LRQ. I would rate the pain at a 7 when it occurs.

I wanted to be an ER doc but gave it up because of my mental illness, so maybe I think I know more than I do?



Started feeling really sick with vague symptoms weeks ago, got a blood test thinking it was mono but got high antibodies for babesiosis, so I go to the infectious disease specialist I saw a couple years ago

I did not like him at the time, as he insinuated I had had a mental break rather than a rickettsial fever years before he met me despite positive blood tests because “people with that look like they’re on deaths door” (it was the sickest I’ve been in my life, ever) 


Anyway I thought maybe I over-blew his attitude in my head and he was the only one I could get an appointment with on shorter notice, by the week of my appointment I had collapsed twice in public, was unable to drive and sleeping 16-20 hours a day.

He ordered more blood tests, (good)

misgendered me despite the pride flags on every door in the office and my chart and driver’s license noting my gender, that’s annoying but whatever, I’ll be young ladied if I can go back to work and shit, but he repeatedly said I “seemed fine” sir my fever is low because I’m on a fuck ton of nsaids, 


Slight detour in which he noticed a cat scratch on my hand and said I should declaw the cat myself with pliers…

Ive recently developed chest/back pains that wake me up after about 4 hours of sleep and require me about 30 minutes of walking/stretching to be able to fall asleep again (if im lucky). This happened to me very suddenly about 3 weeks ago. I just woke up one day morning with a pain mostly in the mid/upper back, which over the following 2-3 weeks has radiated to the right side of my chest.

My initial thought was some muscle tightness that should go away within a few days, but it has not. I do have an appointment scheduled with my GP next week.

This pain has me worried since it reminded me of a Xray/Ct that I had done back in May of 2021 for a broken rib. I suffered a fall down a few steps and fractured my 11th rib on the right side. Initial Xray showed no fracture but mentions ""2cm Focal Opacity at left lung base, appearing somewhat linear suggesting scar"" meanwhile I knew my rib was broken since I can feel it moving when I was breathing, so I had to make a second trip to the ER in the same day and the doc ordered a CT which did show the fracture, but as far as lungs go there was no mention of the focal opacity that was spotted on xray, all it said was "" lungs are clear, no evidence of pneumothorax of pleural effusion""

Currently I have some SOB during exertion, no cough now but several months ago I had Pertussis and when I was coughing there was some blood tinged mucus. Overall its just pain thats bothering me and its mostly felt at night, although I do feel chest pain if I stretch to a certain direction. Im wondering if I should be asking my doc for any imaging? I messaged him of my issue ahead of time and he says ""most likely muskuloskeletal but need examination"".

Obviously like most people here im concerned about cancer.

So about two weeks ago, a mosquito stung me in the arm (the area below the shoulder).

They usually go away after a day or two, but I was very impatient, so I scratched it. Mind you, I was visiting a place that had a lot of mosquitoes and then I went back to my city with less mosquitoes. So I scratched it, and it bled because I scratched it too hard. I've been keeping up with this attitude of scratching it for the past two weeks, because I found it a bit weird that the bump wasn't going away, and I did not think once about looking at it.
Well today I looked at it, and there was a huge red spot of scab, and a ton of bumps.
So when I looked at it recently right now, I found out there were 5 huge bumps each with scabs on them (wounded), and the zone was very red.

I had a heart ablation on 3/8/23 and when they looked at my blood count they noticed I have a very high Neutrophils and low Lymphocytes. They thought it was new but when they look back for the past year it has been that way on many of the CBC panels.

Recently I haven’t been feeling well and one day I even had a mild fever. I’ve been thinking that perhaps it could be the recovery from the ablation but it’s been a month and a half and I still feel sickly. Like weakness, joint pains, some goose bumps and a general malaise with no actual area that hurts. Just not feeling well. 

They have referred me to a Hematologist/Oncologist to make sure it’s not cancer but I read somewhere that high Neutrophils with low Lymphocites may mean cancer, but could it also be cardiac related? 

Also my BP has taken a big dip after the ablation and they had to cut down all my medications drastically as most of them lower BP. Without medication my BP is 100/60 and on top of that when I add my medications it goes to 94/58 HR 74-85

135,AskDocs,"I (53M, 177lbs) was stretching in September of 2021 when I felt something 'go' in my right hamstring.

I thought I'd wait for the pain to go before starting to stretch again, although I only felt pain when extending my leg laterally. The physiotherapists I've seen haven't been super specific, but at a guess it was my semimembranosus or tendinosis. The pain was/is just proximal to my knee.

The pain never left.   


I've seen two physiotherapists who have both given me several treatments of slight mobilisation but I got a little frustrated and asked the most recent therapist for his thoughts. He said I'd most likely torn 'a muscle' when i was stretching, which has since healed, and if I keep stretching it the pain will eventually go away.  


Well, I'm doing my best, but even with very gentle stretching, the pain is still there and just as intense as it was after the initial injury. I've maintained my flexibility in a forward plane (with outstretched legs I'm able to stretch forward and grasp the soles of my feet) and my groin flexibility is still good (frog/straddle stretching position). Anything involving lateral extension hurts like hell still.  


The big issue is I teach martial arts semi-professionally and I can't demonstrate a lot of the things I need to for my students. Despite what my physio said, I find it hard to believe this pain will go with time and work. I'm happy to work but it's just not getting better.  


I'd really just love for someone to say he's right and keep going, but I'd also be very grateful to hear other thoughts and possible directions for treatment.  


Other info - height is 6'. Health - excellent. Fitness level - excellent. No current medication other than 3g of Omega 3 oil per day. No alcohol and non smoker. I'm in Germany if that makes any difference but not a German national.

Many thanks in advance

I've had shingles when I was 25-26, so it's always a worry of mine, but this doesn't really look like shingles, though I can't remember how it looked when it first started.   I do remember it was shocking to see because of how vibrant it was, which this reminds me of.  It doesn't hurt when I touch it, but there's a vague mild sting that sometimes comes from it.  It also doesn't itch.

So, I'm currently having a flare-up of my TMJ disorder.

My heart rate is often very high due to my fear and anxiety. This happens very often when I see doctors; I get scared of being diagnosed with a terrible disease and my heart rate jumps to &gt; 130. If I think I’m about to die, it gets up to 160. Happens often when I get a panic attack and go to the ER. 

At work, I often get scared that I’ll be fired and get my heart rate up to &gt; 100 due to worrying. If something concerning happens (e.g. I have to say I missed a deadline, or I get a message from my doctor) it gets up to &gt; 130 and it’s hard to make it go back down. 

Every time I see a healthcare professional and they see my heart rate, they get really concerned. They often give me an EKG, which is always normal except for “sinus tachycardia.” 

My most recent echocardiograms showed pericardial effusion, but I’ve had this level of anxiety for several years, before the effusion appeared. I’d say my anxiety started at age 15, and the effusion appeared at age 22. The echocardiograms are otherwise normal.

I've had it every once in a while all my life (im pretty sure everyone does) but I turned 15 recently and suddenly out of absolutely no where I've been constantly getting dizzy. Stand up? Dizzy. Move my head too fast? Dizzy. Sit up in a seat after slouching? DIZZY! I'm almost constantly dizzy! I don't even have to lay down or sit for a while, it happens even if I only crouched down for a second or two. Since I'm a minor I've been asking my mom (whos ironically a nurse) for help because it's become unbearable and it's seriously affecting my day to day life but she thinks I'm just overreacting. I bought some iron supplements after a friend said maybe I just don't have enough iron but can an iron deficiency even happen that fast? It's not like it's slowly been happening more and more. It literally just started happening one day. What's wrong with me and how do I make it stop?

As I step in to manage her appointments I was wondering if she needs to see all her various specialists still. She will be seen by a Geriatrician for primary care, and I assume Cardiology would still be needed due to the defibrillator. But would she still need endocrinology and a dietician for the DM? What about Neurology and Psychiatry after the diagnosis?  I got the impression from the Hospitalist that no treatment would be coming for Alzheimer's.

I’ve tested negative for STD’s and UTI’s. Moisturizing does nothing. The only two things that’ve helped have been hydrocortisone and tacrolimus ointment. The issue, however, comes back immediately after I stop using them. 

The pictures were taken during a “moderate” state of the issue. After sex or physical contact, my skin is bright red and burns like hell. Any idea what it could be?

So within the past month,  I have noticed an uptick in moles on my whole body. As of this post, I very likely have 50+ on my body. At first, I didn't think twice about it because they didn't look cancerous, but now that I'm aware of them, I feel like I see a new one everyday. I haven't kept an official record, so it's all based on memory. About 1.5 months ago, I had gone to the dentist, and they checked for any concerning moles on my face/neck/behind the ears and didn't seem concerned though they did joke about the number of moles I had (referring to them as a constellation). Looking at them myself, non of them look cancerous, but I'm willing to go to a dermatologist to get them checked. Note: I haven't really been out in the sun much; it's cloudy season here in Seattle.

However, is there a possibility that this sudden uptick could be indicative of something else? I have other symptoms that I've been dealing with for 2-3 years, including sporadic muscle twitching/spams/jerks + occasional muscle fatigue, and occasional nerve pain/nerve shocks in various areas of my body. I ended up chalking this up as benign fasculation syndrome + anxiety/depression + COVID-19.

I know it sounds like a stretch, but could all these symptoms be related to something sinister? Who would you recommend I go to (primary care vs dermatologist vs etc)?  And do you think it's an emergency? I don't have health insurance right now and am strapped for capital. I may be able to pay out of pocket for a visit to a primary care physician, but I'd have to shop around. The second best thing I could do is to try to get a W2 job and get insurance in +90 days so that if I were to need an MRI, I wouldn't have to pay out of pocket. Thoughts?",t2_172wlq,0,Please help!

Hi everyone, my mum had this itchy spot on her shin and she would scratch until she drew blood, and it grew in some from a few millimeters to around 5cm diameter over 3 months. She puts plasters on it to stop from itching in her sleep, and it helped to heal the skin over but she is developing small, blisters? pimples? around the edge of the circle. These blisters leave orange/yellow spots on the plaster after taking it off. Can someone please tell me what this is?

Chronic back pain
Vitamin D deficiency 
CT scan indicating stroke in the corona radiata 
Depression

Had series of episodes from august to November resembling absence seizures, referred to neurologist, recently had a brain/head/neck mri. 

Findings were normal for head and neck, brain showed “Small areas of T2 signal in the periventricular white matter could be evidence of multiple sclerosis, migraine headache disorder, chronic insults either vascular or infectious, etc.”

All symptoms include:
-Intermittent numbness and tingling in fingers and toes, mostly on left side. 
-exhaustion
-insomnia
-moments of slurred speech(it’s like my tongue forgets to move when I’m talking), memory issues, forgetting words(or not being able to remember the word I want to say).
-severe cramping in the hands where the only way to relieve is for another person to physically release the cramp. 
-constipation/diarrhea switch back and forth. Sometimes I can go three to four days without having a bm, sometimes it’s several times a day.
-loss of appetite, also intermittent, can go 2 days without eating anything or feeling hungry. Then starving for a whole day and then regular appetite for a spell.
-chest pain, maybe lung pain? Mostly just hurts when I’m breathing deeply. Just feels like a constant weight on my chest. 
-pain, just all over pain. It’s not excruciating but it’s always uncomfortable. 


Of course my anxiety and research is leaning towards MS but I wanted to reach out and get some feedback on what others may think?

**Other:** I don’t drink, smoke, vape, or take recreational drugs. I do not have any existing medical issues.  


**Issue:** 

Yesterday I trod in a pothole while out running and wrenched my ankle. I walked the short distance home and elevated/iced my ankle. 

I woke up this morning fully expecting swelling and bruising, but aside from maybe a tiny amount of swelling the ankle looks completely normal. It's uncomfortable and feels stiff, but I'm still able to go about my normal activities (albeit slower than usual with a bit of a limp!). Walking causes only minimal pain. I've been doing gentle seated toe raises to reduce stiffness - there's a slight, painless popping sensation at the front of the ankle when I do this.

related medical conditions: Psoriatic arthritis with enthesitis

Things I've tried:

orthotics, surestep gauntlet DRG flex AFO, ritchie brace, compression socks, PT, ibuprofen, naproxen, arcoxia, celebrex, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, humira

 I have had severe pain in both my feet for several years now. Not responding to my psoriatic arthritis treatments or any painkillers. I have had xrays which were clear and ultrasound synovial screen that was negative. My rheum said that it's not related to my arthritis. I have seen a podiatrist who said I have severe pes planus (flexible) with hypermobility throughout the whole foot. I tried regular foot orthotics and two different AFOs. I currently wear ritchie braces and they help somewhat, but I'm still in pain every day.

Painkillers barely touch it. PT hasn't helped (My PT also said I have proximal muscle weakness if that's relevant).

The pain is worst when I stand for a while. Without AFOs it starts within 10 minutes of standing and with AFOs I usually last about 30 minutes. Walking also hurts but less than just standing. The pain is in the bottom of my foot mostly concentrated around the arch but also the bottom of my heel.. 

Is there a better type of AFO for me? Or some kind of surgery? Do I need an orthopedist instead of a rheumatologist? I would do anything to make this better. Really scared of orthopedic surgery but if there's even a 25% chance that it can fix me I'd do it. Even if I'd still need my AFOs after.

I take 150 mg lyrica and was taking 50mg tapentadol twice a day PRN for chronic pain. 

My GP started me on bupropion xr 150 mg once a day for depression. I've been off and on bupropion for years as symptoms dictate and it's one of the very few antidepressants that have a marked improvement in symptoms and little to no deal breaker side effects for me personally. 

Pharmacist warned of potentially dangerous interactions between bupropion and tapentadol/tramadol.

I was given this diagnosis after many heart, blood, endocrine etc… tests came back as completely normal.

1.) If I sleep in more than typical I have a “bad” day nearly every time (brain fog, fatigue, etc..)

This happens nearly every day no matter how I am feeling and makes it difficult to go places without a full stomach.

I posted previously about my symptoms and got some great advice. I went back to my Doctor who decided to order a blood test which include: Serum C reactive protein and Erythroctye sedimentation rate test. He also said once I had the blood I could start a 5 day course of prednisolone. 

Due to delays it was about a month between the appointment and the blood test (I had the blood test on Friday). 

My symptoms continued to progress, moving from my hands (where us started) to my knees, shoulders, wrists, feet. I was beginning to struggle to sleep at night due to the pain. I was on Naproxen which took the edge off but I was still experiencing issues. It was becoming harder at work. I essentially felt like I was moving through water at times. I felt very slow and weak. I've also had a massive issue with sweating, getting progressively worse. Nail ridging happened and my joints in fingers are all hyperextend.

I started prednisolone. I didn't really feel anything for the first day or two. But yesterday I woke up and felt significantly better. I didn't realise how sick I actually felt in general apart from the obvious pain and issues in my joints. 

Yesterday my blood test results came back showing that both the serum c protein and Erythroctye sedimentation rate were completely normal. So I'm really confused and would love some advice. 

Because my symptoms suggest that it's a inflammatory issue regardless whether its RA or not, and it's what my Doctor seems to think. And from my understanding the prednisolone only works really if inflammation is present in the body. So if it wasn't inflammation, I shouldn't be feeling different at the moment? But my blood test is saying that there is no inflammation. 

So I wondering what could it be? This has been going on from 4/5 months now so I'm just a bit lost to what's happening to me. It's currently a 50 week wait to see a Rheumatologist.

209,AskDocs,"Hi all! 

Firstly this is a throwaway since I don't feel comfortable detailing my partners medical situation on my main account, I hope that's okay! 

My partner (33M) has been experiencing weird head symptoms since early December and we've been through a number of tests and medications since January. I'm not looking for a diagnosis but I am hoping someone has opinions on what suggestions or questions we can bring up at the neurologists appointment next week since we're all out of ideas!

I've tried my best to construct a timeline of symptoms and steps already taken but some details and dates are now slightly fuzzy as we didn't expect this to go on for so long and therefore didn't keep close track at the time


December/January

- Pressure behind right eye, as if a balloon was being inflated
- Light sensitivity
- Stress makes symptoms worsen 
- Visited two ophthalmologists, nothing wrong observed with eye health
- Steroid eye drops prescribed by ophthalmologist as symptoms sound like infection of eye muscles despite apparent eye health
- Bisoprolol and alprazolam prescribed by GP after being told stress and caffeine worsen symptoms - bisoprolol had adverse side effects (somewhat expected since BP pressure is good) and prescription was stopped after two days, and alprazolam does not lessen symptoms 

Early february
 
-Lightheadedness
- Pressure behind eye has moved to below eye, around the sinus area
- Medrol and antibiotics prescribed by different GP after eyedrops had no effect
- CT scan taken of head, results showed a small cyst in the opposite sinus and a minor blockage 
- Medrol and antibiotics had general positive results but symptoms persist
- Steroid nasal spray prescribed and continued medrol prescription

Late February 

- Lightheadedness and general pressure in head
- Pressure under eye starts becoming worse
- Migraine triggered after driving
- Physical activity and time spent outside worsens symptoms
- Difficulty focusing
- Nasal spray prescription ends
- EEG and visit to neurologist
- Neurologist suggests chronic migraine and prescribes topamax and an imitrex injector pen to use when the under eye pain gets worse 

Early March

- Pressure under eye starts becoming pain 
- Imitrex does nothing for symptoms, instead turns whole head numb with pins and needles in head
- Head symptoms persist as does focusing issues
- ER trip due to pain under eye during the night results in a second appointment with the neurologist the next day 
- Indomethacin prescribed, 3 a day for a  week with a follow up appointment the following week
- Medrol prescription ends 

Mid march

- Under eye pain persists but has lessened
- Lightheadedness, light sensitivity and general pressure in head persists
- Difficulty focusing
- A couple of 'good days' were had, in which symptoms lessened, but were still present, to the point he could do more physical activity and focus better
- Neurologist suggests doubling dose of indomethacin for 2-3 days (6 per day) as a kind of 'shock therapy', and then to reduce back to 3xday for a week

Late March/ early April

- Doubling dose of indomethacin worsens head symptoms
- Cheek and temple feel tense
- Pain under eye is still present but ignorable to a degree 
- Second CT scan done, cyst still present but blockage has cleared 
- Episodes of tingling/goosebumps in brain/head which spreads downwards to eyes and causes lightheadedness and difficulties focusing 
- Indomethacin prescription is stopped
- Nortryptaline prescribed
- Blood works taken to test for mineral and vitamin deficiencies, organ problems and allergies - all come back clear 

Something I forgot to add since this has been going on since before the first trip to the ophthalmologist in January is as well as the light sensitivity, after images are a frequent occurrence when he looks at something for too long. Over the counter pain killers like ibuprofen and paracetamol also do nothing. My partner is also convinced that this isn't a chronic migraine as he's suffered from migraines before and what he's feeling now is completely different. We'd like to believe it is, but it's coming up to 2 months on the topamax with no difference - in fact it feels like some symptoms have increased since starting it. 

Current medication is topamax 2xday and nortryptaline 1xday

I should also add there's no sensitivity or pain in his mouth indicating a tooth problem and nothing in his blood to indicate an infection 

With all of these steps taken, does anyone have any suggestions on what we can ask of the doctors next in terms of tests or possible directions we can take?

214,AskDocs,"I am an adult (32m) in the UK, I have always dealt with a needle phobia but I had a  particularly bad experience in Accident and Emergency recently which has left me considering pre-applying EMLA numbing cream on my arms prior to future A&amp;E/Hospital visits.

I've endured many needles in the past but normally I can grit my teeth and look away but for some reason the insertion of the cannula on this occasion was exceptionally painful. Up until this point I've never interjected and actually told them to stop but I couldn't handle the pain this time around. They took 4 attempts to ""successfully"" place the cannula; on the 4th attempt the pain was unbearable and I made multiple attempts to tell the nurse this was hurting more than normal; eventually I told her she needed to stop and remove it as I could not take the pain and something was wrong, she ignored this and continued on; eventually completing the cannulation. I knew this did not feel normal as it continued to be painful once in place and this was later confirmed by a member of staff conducting a scan who had the nurse remove it. 

The entire experience has sadly knocked my confidence as I was slowly getting a little better with needles and had voluntarily gone for vaccines, something I likely wouldn't have done a few years prior. This leads me to my question, would there be any issues from the staff if on future occasions I was to apply my own EMLA  (lidocaine &amp; prilocaine) numbing cream prior to arriving at A&amp;E? I had asked for the cream on previous visits to A&amp;E and have always been told they can't use it as it takes too long to have an affect. I usually can tell a few hours prior that there is a chance I need to go to A&amp;E and so I likely would have ample opportunity to apply the cream on the areas of the arm that they have always used for cannulation. 

Is there any circumstances where me having applied this cream could prevent them from using that site for cannulation? I'm mostly concerned about them moving to be a more painful location due to not wanting to use the numbed areas since they did not apply the cream.

I had intended to ask about this in the A&amp;E but with so much going on it completely skipped my mind and so any advice on this is much appreciated.",t2_9i5p74u30,0,Needle Phobia &amp; Numbing Cream Question (UK A&amp;E),[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12qzk77,True,DeathByDinos,,1,False,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12qzk77/needle_phobia_numbing_cream_question_uk_ae/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12qzk77/needle_phobia_numbing_cream_question_uk_ae/,475680,1681842946,0,,False,1681842958,1681842958,2023-04-18 18:35:46,,,

I have only 3 components of it: hypoplastic thumb in left hand, solitary kidney, and fused neck vertebraes (klippel feil syndrome). My case is pretty mild and you wouldn't notice anything odd about me at a first glance and have led a pretty much functional life and contact sports and everything. But as I grow in my 20's I couldn't not ask myself if this is hereditary and if I have kids would they certainly have VACTERL or its a chances game?

I burned myself at work with hot coffee by accident and I immediately rinsed it with cold water for ten minutes afterward, then I applied a burn gel to help ease the pain. I’ve been keeping up with ibuprofen as needed as well. 

Today I noticed an unusual amount of pus coming from the wound, and the top of my hand feels numb in certain areas. I’ve been keeping the wound covered at work, however whenever I’m not at work I’ve been trying to let air get to it as much as I can. 

I work in an emergency room as an ER tech and I’ve asked multiple physicians and been given different responses. The day of the injury I was told it was a second degree burn and I need to check in immediately. Others told me just to keep applying burn gel and keep it clean so I don’t have to check in. As of right now I’m in a ton of pain and the wound won’t stop leaking pus in multiple areas. Is this something I should be concerned about?

i have been  losing hair for 7-8 months. momth and a half ago my dermatologist told me my hair was thick and great and there was nothing wrong. i told her that i was losing more than 100 (she told me that50-100 hair loss was normal) and she told me that if i was losing more than normal she would know by looking at my scalp. but i have not told her anything about my arms.

and then she prescribed me novophane acm lotion, capsules and a shampo. have been taking them for a month and a half. about a month ago i started taking vitamin d 5000iu a day since my level is 19.9 and its low. i was already taking vitamin d some months ago but i stopped. the vitamin d is called detrivit. and i dont think this has anything to do with my hair loss but about a year ago i noticed some brown perfectly shaped circles (some of them were not circles)  on my neck and chest. they did not bother me or itch, but if i touched them i could feel it and kinda peel it. doctor who was a family doctor prescribed me medication called colorless castelando. they went away once i applied it on skin but i still have a few. 

some hairs on my arms are long, some are short and some of them are not even grown. its like that on both of my arms, but hair on my legs are normal.  and on my head i am losing hair on parts of the head. nobody in my family is bald. i used to not lose any hair before if its normal why am i losing now? and why am i losing hair on arms?

No current medication but no take multivitamins and 4000iu daily of vitamin D

I have very bad health anxiety and made the mistake of getting a home vitamin deficiency test. 

My corrected calcium came back as 2.74mm/ol. I was confused because the doctor who reviewed it said that it was of no concern but that seems high from what I have read. Albumin, HS-CRP and magnesium were normal.

Interestingly a couple of the tests (Vitamin D and Ferritin) could not be analysed because they said the cells had burst and I wondered if this impacted the calcium test? I also just finished a course of Cipro for folliculitis, could that have an impact.

I am going to arrange a proper blood test but wonder if you had any thoughts on whether the home testing method might have created a false high.

For the past 5-10 years I dislocate my pinky toe quite often. In the last 2-3 years it’s been happening even more often, probably every couple months or so. It doesn’t take much force to do it. Kicking a lightweight sneaker on the floor as I walk by, or even just knocking it against my other foot in bed wrong. It’s an awful searing pain, and I have to put on sneakers and walk (limp) around for a while to get it to go back into place. That’s the only way it will go back in the socket. After it pops back in, the pain is usually completely gone. The last time it happened I was in bed Ana had to get to and limp around the house but I couldn’t get it to pop back in that night. So I had to go back to sleep and try not to have it touch anything. In the morning it finally popped back in place after about 30 minutes of limping around. I try to be really careful and not go barefoot anywhere at all, but it still happens. I don’t know anyone else this happens to, and haven’t found much by googling. Is this something I should see a doctor for? Is it worrisome in any way? Is there anything I should or shouldn’t be doing when a dislocation happens? Anything preventative? It hurts like hell and usually happens at the most inconvenient times. Why are my pinky toes such freaks? Am I at risk for nerve or joint damage?

At some point during this time, I realized that my ear had become muffled, and I still cannot hear properly out of that ear. I applied heat to the ear as I read that could help with the pain. After I removed the heat, I heard a crackling sound for a while, the pain began to relieve itself, and throughout the night, clear fluid began draining from the ear. Again last night, some pain returned to the ear, and it is still draining fluid.

240,AskDocs,"I'm 21F. Last month I was hospitalized for an upper GI bleed/severe anemia that had been going on for several months. My hemoglobin at the time of admission on March 4th was 6.5 and I received a blood transfusion. An endoscopy was performed and a large hiatal hernia was noted, along with a mallory-weis tear and a bleeding nodule. I had severe acid erosion in my stomach and throughout my esophagus. All biopsies came back normal. I also suffer from chronic diarrhea that has been ongoing for at least 5 months, and IBD is suspected, but there's not significant enough visual evidence in my colon for a diagnosis.

On April 10th I noticed what appeared to be maroon-colored blood in my stool. I reached out to my doctor and she said I should go to the ER. I waited for over 5 hours before giving up and going home, but they did run a blood test that confirmed my hemaglobin at 12.9. Starting around the 14th, last Friday, I began feeling lightheaded and dizzy with intermittent blurry vision. I've also been feeling very thirsty no matter how much water I drink, with frequent urination. 

This morning I noticed dark brown, almost black diarrhea on two different occasions within an hour. The color looked similar to when I first suspected a GI bleed, but it took months for it to be treated because my blood counts were relatively okay, with only a slight dip in my hemoglobin at the time. The consistency is not tarry at this time but has an abnormal smell.

Ive started working out vigorously for about 4 weeks now. I had an MRI done recently, and i just got news that I have pretty bad herniated discs. As well as some other bad news that's gonna affect my qol. Still haven't had any problems with sex drive and or erection. 

I've been going hard at the gym, running 1 or 2 miles everyday, and lifting heavy weights. Some days I go till failure, some days, I don't but I definitely don't feel like I'm over training or over excreting myself.

I started using supplements for the gym.  

Ashwagandha,
Collagen,
Creatine,
Fish Oil,
Pycnogenol,
Vitamin D,
Zinc,

All of these aren't supposed to have any negative affects with libido or sex drive. If anything they're supposed to help. 

5 days ago I jerked off probably like 10 times in 2 days, I was feeling extremely worked up, as I just started going on dates with really hot women. I got drunk with one of them, and for the first time of my life, I could not get it up. 


After that, all of a sudden ZERO sex drive. Or rather, I'm constantly horny, but I can not get a full erection. Most of the time it's nothing, and when I take some time to myself, cut off all distractions and just put in my favorite flick and try to relax. I get hard for maybe 30 seconds, but if I lose concentration, back to nothing. It's been 5 days since I've last jerked off. 

Any idea what the fuck is going on? Never had any performance issues before, I'm somewhat stressed in life but nothing really serious. I'm still fairly happy about my QoL rn. I just want to be able to have sex again lol. Hoping this isn't permanent.

I'm still horny cognitively, I think about sex as much as I used too. I have the urge to jack off multiple times a day, it just doesn't translate.

Since mid February i have been experiencing some weird symptoms. It started with an uncomfortable feeling in the middle of my abdomen and stomach made a lot of noise. A few days later that feeling moved up in my upper middle abdomen.

It is now april and i still have these symptoms 24/7, everyday, all day long which makes me worry. i wake up with these symptoms and go to sleep with these symptoms. The intensity of these symptoms also don't change, they stay the same. Pills aren’t working, nothing is working. I have been to a GI doctor who did a ultrasound and that came back fine. 2 weeks later i did a gastroscopy and he said he couldn’t find anything. Apparently the biopsies came back fine too. (Negative for H Pylori, negative for coelakie, negative for gardia). I did bloodwork that came back fine. I did another bloodtest friday and suddenly my ferritin is extremly low (4). I also noticed that i don’t have my period for 3 months now. My doctors keep telling me it is anxiety or chronic hyperventilation but i just don’t feel like my symptoms fit with this. I keep thinking it is stomach cancer and i’m really scared. Could you still miss cancer with an endoscopy? Like cancer cells? Anyone who can give me advise what to ask my doctors for tests??

Two questions really: 

1.) is feeling nauseous and warm with a sprain common? Im probably being paranoid but I haven’t really done anything like this before. 

2.) I work as an assistant in an office so im constantly walking around, bending down, walking up and down the office hill etc. My ankle from what I’ve practiced has a bit of pain when in the splint, and an increasing amount of pain when walking without.

This is mostly a rant but feel free to add any input (advice, related content, etc.)

I’m 24 F. I was born with tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia (which has since been repaired) and in 2017 I underwent my 3rd open heart surgery to get my first ever pulmonary valve replacement. Since then I’ve had chronic arrhythmias which have gotten worse as time goes on. I saw my cardiologists last week and they’re finally making the call to do a valve replacement through a catheter.

Pros of this are: less invasive surgery, it’s a day procedure, and it won’t take long to heal.

Cons of this are: the new valve has to be smaller than the old valve and therefore the narrowing of the valve will cause more/worse arrhythmias. They also don’t expect this valve to last long and so the next valve replacement will have to be open heart procedure. 

I already feel like garbage most days cause my arrhythmias take most of my energy and I struggle to gain weight due to this. I haven’t passed out due to my arrhythmias yet and I’m kinda scared I will in the future if they’re worse. My work is quite understanding of my condition and currently I only work 12 hours a week in addition to being on disability but I’m also worried that in the future I won’t be able to work at all… it be what it be I guess

Quick context: I’m 2 and a half years out of a left hip arthroscopy (femoralplasty and debridement of 1cm of calcified labrum). I have moderate arthritis but I’m not in any debilitating pain when I walk, jump, exercise, weight bear, etc. 

My range of motion is much more poorer than in my left hip than my right and i do get pain only when I try to put my hip in certain ranges of motion, mainly abducted ranges, and especially out laterally, like doing a lateral lunge for example. It’s like my left hip is “stuck” at a certain point and can’t flex or bend higher than 90-100 degrees as easily as my right. 

I got these X-Rays back a week ago and although I am seeing my surgeon in a week, the anticipation is killing me because I believe I see a fracture on the X-ray on my femoral head. The doctor that looked at my X-ray (not my surgeon) said I have a heterotopic ossification.

I’ve been dealing with this for about six months. It’s ruining my sex life. It itches pretty consistently, and burns during sex. My skin around this area feels very tight. I’ve gotten tested for STD’s and UTI’s, and they’ve all come back negative. The only thing that’s given me relieve has been hydrocortisone and tacrolimus ointment, but it comes back the second after I stop using either. It’s only on the shaft and head of my penis. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Have a serious porn addiction masturbates around 3-5 times a day from like 1-2 year approx

Yesterday when I was having a masturbating session
I edged for almost like 2hours before releasing
And when I released I felt a very slight ( manageable pain ,in both my testicle and groin area in general) 

Till then a whole day has passed 
And I'm still feeling a little pain in my right testicle

I have self assessed myself ( no lumps no veins no shape change. Physically i havent seen any change in testes both are fine )


And the pain is also like it happens for a second (slight sensation ) and then goes away but comes after every 10 minutes agin for a second 

When I tried to pee and applied some pressure
Then also pain came for a sec or so.

When I'm busy and take my focus off my testes :- then it doesn't bother me 

And when I starts thinking about it ( it suddenly happens ) 

Extra things :- no sign of testicular torsion + I'm a virgin.

I know I have to go to a doctor but I can't tell it to my parents  now ( they are conservative and they will not let me go most prolly )

279,AskDocs,"Background
 - heterosexual male in my late 20’s. 
- In 2022 I had extensive std tests done ruling out pretty much all std’s. 
- Up to that point I had about 6 sexual partners (women)

Since those tests last year, I’ve had a single sex partner, we had unprotected sex about 10-20 times in the past few months. She let on that she was very sexual active (much more than I was)(we’re talking like 5-7 partners a year) so I had her get a std test. She only tested for chlamydia, gonnorhea, and trich and was negative.

But now I’m worried because she didn’t test for hiv/Syphilis etc.

Should I go and get a full panel std test to rule out hiv/syphillis?

It did lower my pulse but also my blood pressure to about 90/70 and it made me feel like I might pass out. If I take 5mg instead of 10mg is there still a chance of my BP dropping too low?

backstory: all my life i have had tachycardia, with no other symptoms. in 2018, i had a lot of stress in my life and started having some other symptoms including shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness. This was nonstop for about 3-4 months. I did go to a cardiologist in 2018 and he made jokes  about me being overweight, (i was 185llbs at the time and had a baby 3 months previously), and just kept telling me to lose weight, but never did any tests. i got upset and stopped looking for help. After a while symptoms calmed down. i still always have tachycardia and some mild symptoms, but nothing that feels life threatening. just get out a breath easily and get dizzy spells when changing positions or bending over. 

yesterday, i woke up feeling like i was having a heart attack. i felt chest tightness, pain in my left shoulder, severe pain in my left upper arm that would come and go in waves, very dizzy and short of breath, nauseous, weak, and shaky. it seemed like one of my ""episodes"" but worse. 

so i went to the ER. Every blood test was normal. Xray was normal. Resting HR stayed between 120-130bpm which is a higher than normal for me but normal during episodes. Blood pressure normal. 

My EKG showed: Borderline T wave abnormalities, anterior leads 

they scheduled me with a cardiologist and said I will probably have to wear a halter monitor for a few days. but I cant see the cardiologist for over a month. 

I tried to research myself and the main thing showing up is Wellens Syndrome. 

Just wanted to see if anyone had any input.

I had gone from 185 to 238 and they worsened some other problems I've had with my heart rate. Since stopping I haven't been feeling anxious or depressed. I'm not sure if the weight loss is related to anxiety, depression, or stopping those medications.

Other problems I have are fast heart rate (I rarely check it anymore but when I do usually 110 or faster) and breathlessness while standing and after eating, weakness and tremors and legs while standing, getting close to passing out ocassionally, ocassional nausea after eating (which started about 2 1/2 years ago, cardiologist said I am healthy but is worsening).

301,AskDocs,"Hi all, 
So long story but I’ll try to keep it short. Back in Nov I was 37 weeks pregnant and I noticed some toe pressure. I thought it was weird but didn’t think anything of it. (At this time my baby was transversed and facing the back)
Had my baby (emergency c section) , had to take it easy for about 6 weeks due to the c section. Then around 7 weeks I noticed the toe pain again along with finger pressure too this time. A week after that (8 weeks postpartum) I had a rush of tingles all along my left arm and it felt like it went up to my face. I immediately went to the urgent care. All vitals were pretty normal and the lady just concluded it was probably just PP carpel tunnel. But then the following days I got numb/tingling feet and some fingers on my other hand got tingly too. Went back in and the guy just thought it had to do with anxiety. 
*BTW I also did blood work the first time I went in and my thyroid was a little low and I was slightly anemic *
Went back to a scheduled appt a few weeks later and redid bloodwork for thyroid including T4 and if was normal again. 
Ever since the tingles/numbness (which have subsided since it first began but it’ll switch spots sometimes where it is)
I currently experience muscle spasms , eye twitching (been constant for 2 months but has gotten a bit better since I started seeing a acupuncturist ), and now sharp random nerve pains that specifically happen when I’m active and moving around. 
I’ve also done the following test :
EMG - normal 
Ultrasound on upper abdomen - normal 
MRI (brain and cervical spine) - normal 
Skin biopsy (when my neurologist was thinking it was small fiber neuropathy ) - normal 
Bloodwork - normal minus the beg of all this when my thyroid came back slightly off and iron levels . But since retesting those have been normal . 

Today I did a X-ray (at a chiropractor office) and my spine looked fairly normal- there was some slight compression on
My lumbar probably from haveing two babies and one very recently (also had an extra vertebrae not sure if that’s insightful at all)

Anyways- has anyone ever had neuropathy and everything come back normal??? Nothing was detected , it leaves me so confused. Any moms out here have anything similar happen during the end of their pregnancy or postpartum?

I got two long-haired cats about 1 month ago. I have never had allergies to anything in my life. 3 days into having the cats, I started having allergy symptoms: runny nose, sneezing, wheezing, itchy, watery eyes, and twitching eyelids. I started taking generic cetirizine HCl, and after about a week my symptoms had decreased significantly. After 2 weeks, it was like I didn't have any allergies.

Then yesterday, the symptoms started up again, though not as bad--no eyelid twitching or wheezing. This is only when I am petting my cats--I'm fine when out of the house. I have not lapsed in taking my medicine daily in the morning at all.

Symptoms: hot flashes, two months. Odd periods (variable cycles), several years

**is this definitely perimenopause or menopause, or could it be related to my prolactinoma or treatment for it?**

I started treatment for my pituitary tumour a year ago. Tumour size started at 5mm, last MRI a few months ago had it at 3mm. Taking 0.5mg cab weekly.

Estradiol - 25 pmol/L (no range listed)

Free T4 - 11.5 pmol/L (reference range: 7.5 - 16.0)

LH - 36.1 IU/L (no range listed)

Prolactin - 3.2 ug/L (tended around the 30s, had a high of I think 42) range: 0.0 - 25.0

TSH - 1.10 mU/L . 
So my TSH historically was 0.8, until I gained weight and my menstrual cycle started getting odd and this tumour was found, when it got to 1.6. With treatment it went down again to 0.71 last year.) range: not listed

I have been sick now for roughly 4 weeks. At first it just seemed like I had an upper respiratory infection, sinuses were extremely congested. Mucinex helped clear it up. However, I had a very slight cough that wouldn’t go away. 

About 2 weeks ago the cough started to worsen horribly after I had gone out for a walk one night. It was a dry and unproductive cough. I was put on 40mg total of prednisone for 5 days. After a few days I slowly started to get better, however my symptoms were not gone by the end of the medication. I have also been using albuterol, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours, but it doesn’t seem to do much of anything. 

Over the next few days my cough began to worsen again. I was prescribed a course of antibiotics yesterday and a cough suppressant. The cough suppressant numbs the back of my throat but the urge to cough is coming from my chest and hurts very bad. 

I cannot walk for extended periods of time without it getting painful to breathe. I don’t have a fever, and otherwise sound completely normal. I have a painful headache most of the time from coughing and it gets worse when I cough. Mucinex also has not helped either, nothing is coming up period.

319,AskDocs,"Hi reddit this is a little ranty I’m still quite upset. 

I (16F) suffer from chronic migraines and a chronic pain condition and have been prescribed 30mg amitriptyline daily. Before beginning would like to say, I do know that it’s better to take them at night but that’s not entirely realistic for me. I’ve been told to take it nightly but it’s very hard to do so consistently as my pain flares up when I’m exhausted and tired so by the end of the day it’s both hard to remember and often to painful to do. For the past month or so I have been taking them in the morning and have been doing so consistently, I don’t get tired or super drowsy after taking them so I don’t see how this is harmful. It’s also been harder to take nightly since school started up. 

I had an appointment with my GP today and was told off about taking amitriptyline in the morning, my doctor didn’t give me a reason not to take them in the morning apart from I could be tired throughout the day. I told her that this was the only way I could take them consistently and that I thought it was better to take them everyday in the morning than every two days taking them at night, but she wasn’t listening and said that there was “no real reason” I couldn’t take them nightly which was a slap in the face and really hurt. I was upset but I remained calm and said that this was my choice and asked to move on as we had more to cover she said that she “wasn’t happy and would have to talk to mum about this”. I also want to point out that she was not the one to prescribe me this, that was my neurologist. 

I am really hoping that there is a good reason for her statements as up until this point apart from a few instances of not listening to me she has been an okay doctor. 

So please if there is a reason to not take amitriptyline in the morning please let me know.

326,AskDocs,"19M I’m going to my first doctors appointment tomorrow because I finally found one that takes my insurance. I’ve struggled with anxiety my entire life and could never get any help, and I’m scared that the doctor is just not going to believe me or disregard me- because it took me months to find this doctor in the first place.
I’ve always been very anxious. On my first day of college, I started to faint because they asked us to introduce ourselves. I struggle with being social and haven’t made friends since middle school. 

I live on my own, work, and im a full time college student so my life has become more stressful. Recently I’ve been having “episodes” of intense panic and worry. I cant think clearly, I get clammy and cold, I get nauseous and I just feel like I’m going to die for no reason. I’ve tried every calming exercise and the feeling will just continue for hours until I take a Benadryl and go to sleep. When I wake up, I feel so happy because the feeling is finally gone- but then it comes right back when the night comes again.

330,AskDocs,"I had a breast ultrasound yesterday and they found a “mass” in the left axilla which I just realized was the armpit and that sent me spiraling due to there being another possible discrete mass or tissue. It’s contorting my breast when I lift my arm. They want to watch it and come back in 6 months. The radiologist didn’t specify if he thinks it’s a lymph node but I would assume so because online I’ve read masses don’t typically grow in the armpit. My mind goes straight to, the mass in the dense tissue is cancer and has spread to lymph node noted in results. Would there be evidence of that via ultrasound- a cancerous lymph node? Mine is solid but well defined…Here are my results: 

FINDINGS: Sonographic imaging of the right breast demonstrates homogeneous tissue with no significant focal abnormality appreciated. There is no discrete sonographic abnormality in the medial right breast corresponding to an area of palpable concern indicated by the patient. Sonographic imaging of the left breast again demonstrates a 0.5 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm superficial well-defined hypochoic nodule in the approximate 7:00 position, 7 cm from the nipple. This shows no significant change from prior sonograms dating back to June 2021. There is a 0.3 x 0.5 cm well-defined hypochoic nodule appreciated in the left axilla, not previously identified. There is a questionable hypochoic area measuring 0.6 x 1.0 x 1.4 cm in the deep periareolar 3:00 left breast, not previously identified. It is uncertain whether this represents a discrete mass versus area of tissue heterogeneity.
IMPRESSION: 0.5 x 1.0 cm superficial well-defined hypochoic lesion in the 7:00 left breast, unchanged from prior sonograms dating back to June 2021.
A 0.3 x 0.5 cm well-defined hypochoic nodule is appreciated in the left axilla with a questionable 0.6 x 1.4 cm hypochoic area in the deep periareolar 3:00 left breast, not previously identified. 6 month follow-up ultrasound is suggested for these areas.
No significant sonographic abnormality in the right breast corresponding to an area of concern in the medial right breast demonstrated by the patient. Clinical monitoring is recommended for any areas of palpable concern. A progressive palpable abnormality could prompt additional evaluation.
ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS Category 3: Probably benign.

332,AskDocs,"This happened when I was 15. Parents took me to hospital as I was having pain in stomach. Get checked in. Dad stays with me for the first bit. Doc comes to my room that night (old man close to 70 I'd say), presses various parts of my stomach. Gets to very low parts of my stomach, and to get there he pulls my pants down a little with the very top of my dick exposed. He stops there, thought it was a little weird. 

Next morning my dad is gone, old doctor comes back to my room to check in on me again. This time he pulls the curtain shut around the bed. He does the same routine as the night before, but now as he's getting to my lower stomach and the top of my dick is exposed he says 'everything ok down there?'. I stammered and quietly said yes. He kept pulling down my pants until most of my dick was exposed. Thankfully I had devoped a weird blister on my penis a few days before (never had it before or since - no idea where it came from but I'm still very thankful for it). Doctor stops and says 'oh...... What's that?'. And I couldn't answer I was in so much shock. All I really thought was 'I dunno, you're the doctor, you tell me' but stayed silent. Then the doctor followed it up with 'oh I'm sure it's nothing and will heal right up' then pulled my pants back up and left.

Not sure if it was inappropriate, but it definitely feels that way. Still grateful for that blister, I feel like it might've stopped him from doing more.

My sister was dx with lupus before she died of heart failure. My mother is also dead after becoming addicted to opiates from several brain surgeries for multiple brain aneurysms.

Since I was a teenager I get these episodes where one side of my face will throb, feel hot and have shooting pains for a few days and then I’ll notice one small canker sore in the back of my mouth on the side that hurts. The canker sore is always on my bottom gum all the way in the back of my mouth on the affected side. The pain and canker sore will go away after 7-10 days and this happens every 6-8 weeks. 

At first I thought it was due to my wisdom teeth rubbing on my cheek so I had them removed and that didn’t help. Then I thought it was from clenching my jaw so I used night guards and that didn’t help. My mom did say at one point she had the same problems and said it was from herpes. I did research this and found some information that when herpes goes dormant it can live on the trigeminal nerve. When I researched this nerve, I found that the pain always follows the pathway of this nerve. I also read about trigeminal neuralgia and that most those cases are caused from a problem with blood vessels near it so I’m not sure if that’s something I’m dealing with since I get the canker sore.

I’ve talked to my primary about this and she looked at me like I had 2 heads and said maybe I should see a neurologist but I’m thinking maybe if I went on valtrex it would prevent it. My primary says she doesn’t give valtrex for an occasional canker sore and is urging me to see a neurologist but it’s expensive and time consuming to get into them.

The coughing has been every few hours, or when I breathe in dry air. It can be a singular cough that barks up the mucous, or a continuous cough that leaves me breathless, until I cough up a wob. It honestly feels like my lungs are trying to puke. Since last week, I've now been having these coughing fits in the middle of the night. It's really driving me crazy.

351,AskDocs,"Hi there. I'm 25 AFAB. I do take daily medication for mental health, but I do not think that is relevant in this case. Probably relevant to mention - never broken or fractured any bones. 

So I've had this thing for as long as I can remember - when I open my mouth, my jaw clicks/pops. Every time, and on both sides (mostly on the left side). This was once noticed by a dentist, but he didn't really say anything other than ""hmm"". There is absolutely no pain or discomfort of any kind, aside from the sound of it being unpleasant. When I tried googling it, it seemed like this is something that would be caused by trauma (or teeth clenching) and is usually painful. 

Second thing, similar thing happens to one of my lower ribs on the left side. It will randomly ""pop"", which mostly just causes me to bend over / to the side.

353,AskDocs,"Hello - thanks in advance for any info or advice!  54F Caucasian, bupropion for depression, chronic GI condition achalasia.  Obese (about 200 lbs)

I was injured in an MVA 3 months ago when I was in a stationary small car waiting to make a turn when hit from behind at highway speeds by a van driving by someone focusing on their phone - car totaled, side airbag deployed, pushed through a ditch and into a field.  I and the driver were transported to ER and had CT scans, XRays, etc.  My main injuries found at the time were a brain bleed (small, healed on its own), broken rib (6th on right, healed OK).  I had tons of bruising on my legs and across my lap area and my thighs were very very painful, but no bones broken there.  I had a lot of general swelling in my legs, but on my outer thighs I additionally had defined swollen lumps (which I've joking nicknamed ""my innertubes"")

For 6-8 weeks, I had so much pain in my thighs.  The other swelling in my legs and the bruising diminished over about that time frame, but the thigh swellings remained.  The thigh swellings did eventually get less painful, and became almost numb-feeling, although occasionally give jolts of pain for no reason, or when bumped/pressed hard.

I saw my PCP about these and she sent me for an ultrasound.  The diagnosis from that was that I have Morel-Levallee lesions on both thighs.   They are basically about the size of my spread-out hand.    The Ultrasound gives dimensions of the ""collection"" as 10.4x8.1x3.5cm for the bigger one and notes that there is internal debris and septations - I can post the full text of ultrasound if desired.  My doctor got the ultrasound results and referred me to Surgery.

I googled these lesions after hearing the diagnosis to try to see what the treatments were and so forth.  Basically they describe these injuries as ""closed degloving,"" which maybe explains how severe my pain was in my thighs after the accident when nothing was noted as being ""broken"" by the ER.

Most of the info out there is geared toward medical people, maybe because this is kind of rare.  My (non-medical-person) take on the info was that if the lesions are small or on the knee, they are treated by using compression, but if they are larger, then often procedures are done.  This can include aspiration, and possibly doing drains (depending on the amount of fluid removed), or sometimes larger opening/debriding.  Sometimes they do something to try to adhere the layers together where they were separated.  My brother-in-law, who is a family practice MD looked at the ultrasound report and said I'd likely have drains inserted for a couple of weeks and thought it was possible to have talc be used to adhere the flesh layers.

So I went into the surgery appointment kind of expecting to hear about some procedure or other.  But basically the PA who saw me just said ""we don't do anything for these.""  And told me to buy some bike shorts to compress the lesions.  Said no matter how long it took to heal I wouldn't need to seek any further medical advice/treatment for them.  Wouldn't give any estimation of healing time, just ""months not weeks."" 

My skin is currently good over the lesions, so they are likely not necrotic currently.  They are still huge fluid filled lumps on my legs and uncomfortable all the time, with jolts of pain occasionally.  They affect my movement some (moving ""fast"" is difficult, although a bit less since I've been wearing compression shorts), and I have to sleep flat on my back because I can't roll on my sides at all, so my sleep is affected.  Also intimate relations are affected.  The thought of these taking years to heal, or maybe never healing, is very frustrating and depressing.

My PCP said she was going to check with Ortho to see if they had any other options, but I haven't heard anything on that yet.  My husband's uncle was an orthopedic surgeon and said that it isn't surprising that general surgery didn't want to do anything about them, but that maybe I should try a plastic surgeon.

I felt so disappointed at that surgery visit that I feel like I must really want a procedure, although that does scare me because of the pain and I have read that the outcomes are not always great.  I feel like I should be happy that it will heal on its own, but I'm not.  Like if I knew it would be 2 or 3 months maybe, but I've read that people can have these for years.  I kind of feel like it may actually never heal, but I don't really have any basis for that thought I guess.

From the literature out there and my not being a medical person I just can't get a good read on what is recommended.  The main study I've seen is a Mayo clinic study and from that I feel like according to their decision tree my injuries would result in a procedure.

Anyway, sorry for the length of this.  Anyone experienced with this kind of trauma injury that can recommend if I should seek treatments from other specialties?  What specialties?  Or wait a while and see if things heal?  How long?  Is it really the case that no matter how long it takes to heal I should just live with it???

Maybe there is something I don't understand, but if it is as simple as that contradiction, it casts doubt on her assessment of my labs. Additionally, she told me I needed to drink more water. But I drink a minimum of 64oz each day religiously, I keep track of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to that, my homocysteine was elevated from the reference range slightly. upper bound 10.4 umol/L, mine measured at 10.7 umol/L. My B12 and folate were in the positive ranges, so this along with my creatinine made me concerned about my kidneys. She told me I needed more folic acid.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, my urine sample was contaminated and was no good, but there were ketones found in my urine. There was also bacteria and WBC, but I'm told that that is because there were skin cells in my urine so that could account for it. I asked if i could give another sample, she said she wasn't concerned, but I am not at ease.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been spotting heavily the last several days, but I have had a normal period the last several months. I am mid-cycle and had a normal period 15 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

It struck me as concerning that all the things that were elevated on my blood work were to do with kidney function, but I did not feel that that trend was addressed during my appt, and maybe that's because it's not really a trend to be concerned about.

&amp;#x200B;

Can a physician please put my mind at ease? Or tell me what to do next?

No pregnancy complications. Baby is exclusively breastfed. Today I noticed in his diaper excess mucous. The diaper was stringy with globs. I’ll attach a link to the pictures - warning, poop picture! I do know that allergies, and dairy allergies often present with mucous diapers. That it can be a sign of inflammation? Does this diaper seem in line with that? Is it worth mentioning to the family physician? Should I consider cutting out dairy or just wait and see? Otherwise baby has no other health concerns or symptoms, other than what I would say is normal spit up, fussiness levels. I have noticed though he is a very gassy baby!

I appreciate any input!

For about 3 months, it was almost daily though they would disappear for 5-6 hours at a time. Then, finally I found a few days a week without a headache. But then, even the tiniest bit of exercise triggers an exertion headache so one time I jogged for 2 min legit, 2 minutes I say, and got a 3 week nonstop headache for every day, max 2 hours off a day. Finally that was subsiding but then I got the Bivalent booster and boom, headache started one day later, and has never left ONCE for 7 months. But in the beginning, it wasn't too bad like some days I find 2-3 hours a day without a headache, sometimes the headache would be mild, other times worse. now starting March, (I got vaccine in October) the headache became constant, like max 15min without a headache a day. Now, we are in April, and the headache is 24/7, not even one minute off. And the severity got much worse too. What could this mean? Did the brain aneurism rupture? Do you think I have brain tumor? I have no other symptoms of this stuff on Google. Just constant headache.. starting 4 days ago the pain was so severe though like I felt my head squeeze and its not getting better. I know people will say get MRI/CT scan/blah blah, but considering this all started from catching Covid before any contagious Omicrons were around, WEARING A MASK and ALONE, just in the elevator or hallway of my building.. my immune system proved its already suppressed so I'm doing my best to find a cure without testing.

I will preface this with my current status:

30F, PMHx depression/anxiety  possible ADHD and PMDD; no chronic health problems, FHx hyperuricemia and risk of colon cancer on fathers side; risk of diabetes on mothers side (aunt and grandma were diabetic and mother was Dx with pre diabetes but it’s well controlled through diet )

Current medications: 

venlafaxine 150mg PO QD
Daylette birth control PO QD
pregabalin 300mg PO PRN
Supplements include vitamin D, omega 3, and sometimes magnesium

So I’m kind of stumped as to a persistent knee problem I’ve been having. I have pain and swelling superior and lateral to the patellar tendon. When I hyperextend my knee, it shakes and the other leg does not. I have pain in certain sitting positions and it’s hard to bend down to pick something up for instance. Sometimes I get a sensation behind the knee where it feels like it’s “pulling” something. I also have cracks and almost like a rubbing sound when I adjust my knee. Over the summer last year I was having migratory arthritic pain in my left knee, then right knee and then left shoulder. I was tested for lupus and RA and crp/esr were all negative. The arthritic pain stopped but the problem in my right knee persists to this day. Could it be fibrous tissue from healing from the arthritic pain?

Would the next best step be an ultrasound? It’s not super serious but it is a bit painful and is an everyday problem.

 [Answers on my fathers death : AskDocs (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12i67l1/answers_on_my_fathers_death/) 

&amp;#x200B;

We have had the results of the post mortem and I'd like to make sense of it.

His death was as a result of natural causes, he had ischemic heart disease and Cirrhosis of the liver. They don't know what the infection was so they've sent off samples to test to see if contributed but that will take a while. This was not what I was expecting as we didn't know he had either of those diseases. We did know one of his valves in his heart had more trouble pumping but he was told it wasn't a cause for great concern.

He had a scans on his heart amongst other scans to check him out a year ago after his pulmonary embolism. Is the ischemic heart disease easy to miss or could it have developed in the last year and would the trouble with the valve be associated with that?

He was ill from the infection and lack of eating so would there have been any way to treat him if it would have been known?

The report doesn't mention a heart attack but given he had heart disease isn't that what would have happened?

He didn't seem in pain at the end and he just went to sleep so it confuses me that this was the reason. With his history in my original post and the cause of death did his organs just quietly shut down?

We all thought it was the toll of the infection that would be the cause of death and his body shutting down. I'm just confused and want to understand better.

It just eventually goes away after a month or so and then comes back a couple months later. 

I don’t want to use topical steroids anymore so I’m looking for any other advice or ideas. What could cause these flare ups? What are some questions I can ask my GP?

Good morning. 

Within the last two years, I’ve developed a sulfur body odor. I’m currently 30 and never have a problem like this in my entire life. I’m extremely hygienic (shower thoroughly twice a day everywhere and always wear clean clothes.). Before, I would only ever smell if I was doing something active and sweating intensely. That was normal though. Now even after showering, I have this smell which coworkers have complained about and gossiped around me. I’ve even been told politely a couple of times as well. As you can guess, this makes life very uncomfortable everyday. I’ve seen two gastroenterologists already. The first one was no help and the second one seems more promising. So far, they’ve narrowed out H pylori, Chrons Disease, any inflammation in the gut, and Celiacs disease. I also usually have two vowel movements a day. Those are usually somewhat easy to pass but sometimes I’m a little backed up and takes more time. I’ve also been keeping a food journal. I don’t have my family’s medical history since I was adopted from Central America when I was younger. Another thing is for years (19-28) I heavily abused alcohol. Usually 4-12 drinks a day. I’m desperate to get my life back and not leave in shame everyday.

Hey Everyone,

I've had a bit of a weird head pain going on about 5 days now. It's a pain on my forehead above my left eye, and really only hurts if I move my head quickly, bend over, cough etc.. If I'm stationary or move very slowly it doesn't seem to bother me. I chalked it up to a migraine, but 5 days without much change has got my anxiety going a bit. I'd go see my G.P but there is a shortage on doctors where I live and it's about a month wait to get in and see them. Any thought or advice would be very appreciated. Should I be concerned? Should I go to a walk in clinic or ER?

I woke up screaming in pain for a second and she was already jumping away. It was all very quick but I gathered that’s what happened. (My husband thought I was having a burst appendix last night at first.) 

Immediately after, I had constant cramping and aching pains in my stomach that continued throughout the night (even in my dreams) and to the next day. I don’t feel sick or anything, just really hurts and feels achey.

389,AskDocs,"To preface: I will be going to see a doc - just trying to decide if I go to the ER, urgent care or PCP. ER is obviously expensive and this isn’t an emergency, but I can get a scan done in the same visit. Urgent will be quicker to get into than my PCP. I digress. 

Last year I really dinged myself up on a scooter (hit something and flew about 20 feet in the air, hit the ground and slid). I hurt my arm and knee. I couldn’t walk for a couple days but I thought it was because of the scrapes and bruises. I did get my elbow checked out and it was a small fracture and a bone marrow edema from such a hard hit. Not to mention my insurance was crap and I really could only afford to have one thing checked out and that was my arm….

After my knee healed okay; it would occasionally give out walking up stairs or pop loudly. But I could shake it off and it would be back to normal in a couple minutes. 

I’m now getting back into running and my inner knee is hurting. Hurts to put weight on it, tender to touch, it’s popping pretty frequently. Heck, it’s sore to bend if I’m sitting down.

Trying to wrap my head around what exactly this is (bursitis? Mcl? Meniscus?) and what form of care to start with (er, urgent, pcp). 

I’m thinking this is very much correlated to my previous injury, which also leads me to also ask: can an mcl or meniscus tear be ongoing or have a higher risk of re-injury?",t2_vo8lbv6s,0,F*cked Knee,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12qoqti,True,iyamstifl3rsm0m,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12qoqti/fcked_knee/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12qoqti/fcked_knee/,475643,1681827854,0,,False,1681827869,1681827870,2023-04-18 14:24:14,,,

High cholesterol is something that runs on my dad's side of the family, so I always knew I had a high risk of having high cholesterol.

After I found out I kept telling my parents to set an appointment with a doctor that could help me regulate this since its WAY over the healthy limit, but they just brushed it off and said that if I diet and do more regular exercise it will go down to normal again without the need to go to a doctor. While diet and exercise will help me and I obviously plan on starting to do that, I'm scared to not get this followed up by a medical professional after looking at the possible risks associated with high cholesterol.

I’ve been taking SSRI’s (sertraline, 150 mg) and orgametril (lynestrenol, 5 mg) &amp; HRT (testosterone, 40.5 mg in 2.5 g androgel). 

I have been taking orgametril for about 3 months now to suppress menstruation to alleviate gender dysphoria. On top of that I started hormone replacement therapy less than a month ago.

Before orgametril I had very frequent stomach aches and cramps. This always worsened during menstruation. I expected orgametril to not only suppress the bleeding, but also the symptoms I felt during menstruation.

It did! But not only did the extreme pain during the menstruation ‘disappear’, but also my stomach issues during the rest of the month. Obviously, I still have an upset stomach every once in a while, but is nowhere near as extreme as it used to be.

I used to take A LOT of paracetamol in order to barely function. During my periods it was a regular occurrence to take 8 painkillers a day (sometimes including ibuprofen). Outside of my periods, I had to take 2 (or more) painkillers every other day to be able to function.

I can’t help but wonder whether this means that the hypothesis of having endometriosis wasn’t that weird after all… After all, I know orgametril is sometimes being used to cope with endometriosis.

Side note, I’ve been to my GP about it before, but I wasn’t taken seriously, like a lot of other people experiencing extreme pain due to periods.

Is this a farfetched thought or do you think there could be some truth to it?

Image of rash (NSFW): https://ibb.co/MM9jXtQ

I had sex on Friday, and late Saturday night, early Sunday morning, this rash appeared. It’s red, a little itchy, and kind of burns. Nothing too painful.

I put some cortisone cream on it (two times), but it doesn’t seem to have made any positive difference. 

Is this a yeast infection? (Can men even get yeast infections?) or is it something more concerning?

Should I keep treating it with cortisone, or should I go see a doctor?

A few months ago I went to a different doctor to start HRT and was prescribed estradiol and spironolactone, but chickened out and never went to pick up the prescriptions. However, the pharmacy for some reason mailed 2 months worth of spironolactone to me for free.

The doctor who I saw most recently is through my university and just took over the department. She has very little experience and is playing it safe by only prescribing one medication at a time, which I understand. However, it seems it is common practice to prescribe both of these at once, and the testosterone-blocking effects of spironolactone are very very important to me.

Good morning guys

I am a 22 year old male, I’ve had this red growth for maybe 6 months now, 2 more developed around the same time but went away. 

My family has lots of skin conditions especially skin tags and moles but nothing like this, most of the time I forget I have this growth but the other day I clipped it on my belt and it became irritated. 

The growth doesn’t grow it’s remained the same size since it appeared and no new growth’s have appeared. Other than that no symptoms, feel fine and otherwise healthy. Don’t smoke, used to drink but don’t anymore, no drugs, have 1 partner, don’t workout enough but also not lazy. 

Any help would be appreciated, mildly concerned that I should be paying more attention to this.

And they found out it’s an ileus/partial obstruction. They put an NG tube down her throat the first week and it seems to help her with the pain. She was able to eat some soup. They saw her get better and start removing the NG tube, it was fine for a couple days and now she’s back to vomiting again. And the pain seems to worsen as well. She couldn’t pee at first, now, very little came out, more frequently and she said it hurts every time she pee. The doctor tried to reduce her pain medicine because it can worsen. I dont know how to help her seeing her crawl up in a ball every time she in pain. Does anyone has any experiences with this or how to make her feel better?

Medications: none (just a multivitamin and vitamin D) 
Non-smoker, have a glass or two of wine or beer maybe 2-3 days a week. 
Normal BMI, run 3-4 days a week and also lift weights. 
Duration: about 2 months, though I’ve had tinnitus much longer 
Symptoms: high pitched tinnitus, especially in left ear. Feeling of fullness/clogging alternating in both ears, especially my left. My hearing is ok. No fever. 

About 2 months ago, I woke up and my tinnitus was much worse and my ears (especially left) felt very clogged. The valsava maneuver worked, but my left ear felt full still. This went on for about two weeks. mostly in the left ear but occasionally switching to the right. Decongestants helped slightly. After a visit to the doc, she said it was probably a sinus infection and gave me a z pack and some prednisone (low tapering dose.) she also said that my right ear had some was and told me to get some debrox. She also prescribed Flonase and told me to take some allergy meds as needed. The debrox did work on my right ear. I didn’t try any in my left ear as she said it was clear. 

Things were better for about a week after stopping the meds, but now I feel like I’m back where I started! I hate taking decongestants (Zyrtec D, Claritin D) because they make me anxious/ dizzy, though they do help a little bit. Nasal spray seems to have no effect. One thing that does make it 1000x worse is drinking alcohol- if I have even one drink the night before, the next morning when I wake up my ears are roaring! The past few days have been especially bad since I’m on vacation. 

I am going to send a message to my doc today or tomorrow about it. 

Questions: 
1) could all of this be allergy related? I’ve only ever had mild allergies in the past. 
2) should I be asking for an ENT referral? 
3) is it possible that this is all a reaction to alcohol? 

Possibly unrelated: for the first time in a decade I experienced Raynaud’s phenomenon a few times this past winter. Doc aware, not concerned.

Also, lights bothered my eyes a lot and I was quite confused at times (not realizing mistakes I made, taking time to realize what I did). This morning, I feel better.

2 months ago I had a brief period when I had these intense flashes of dizziness . Like I turn my head in a certain direction and I feel like I just got hit by a truck . It just lasted for 5s or so . So I then went to a doctor who asked me to get an mri cuz they wanted to rule out a brain tumor . That's when I started getting anxious about brain tumor . The results then came out clean 

The present:

2 weeks ago it started again out of no where - the paranoia about brain tumor . I was staring at my mri scans for like 4 hours on end as if I was insane then comparing them to scans on Google with brain tumors . It was all fine until I saw this one white spot in a flair scan ([https://imgur.com/a/QLyTyr7](https://imgur.com/a/QLyTyr7)) . I went to a neurologist who said it was a normal blood vessel and I had nothing to worry about .

417,AskDocs," 

Hello,  


I'm a 32 years old male, I'm had a hearth mitral valve operation about 2 years ago( I'm taking cardio aspirine everyday prior to that operation)

Here is a summary of my history with alcohol and other drugs:

* About 10 years of alcoholism (approximately 3 years ""clean"" except for 1 day of relapse)
* 3-4 years of opioids (tramadol, oxycodone, suboxone) (2 months and 18 days clean)
* 2-3 years of marijuana use (still smoke very occasionally)
* 12-13 years of tobacco use (52 days clean)

Now, my problem is that about 1 month ago, I had a one-day relapse of drinking (I consumed about 1 liter of beer and half a bottle of sparkling wine that night). The day after, I had a severe hangover, which was expected, but the hangover persisted for more than 2 weeks (I didn't drink any alcohol after that night). Then, I felt fine for about 1 week.

However, I had a dream in which I was drinking a lot of alcohol, and I woke up feeling slightly hungover for 2 or 3 days. It wasn't too bad initially, but the hangover feeling worsened, and now it's been about 10 days since the dream, and I feel extremely hungover every day.

My doctor said this can happen to former alcoholics and opioid addicts, but it hasn't stopped. My days have become unbearable, and I don't know what to do (I have an appointment with an addiction specialist, but it's not for another 3 weeks).

Additionally, I was diagnosed with COVID-19 yesterday. I think I had the illness about 6 weeks ago, I had what I thought was the flu and was sick for 2 weeks (before the persistent hangover feeling began). You might think that the hangover feeling is due to COVID-19, and maybe it didn't help,but I believe the hangover feeling is unrelated. It started the day I drank too much, and it hasn't gone away since!

If any of you have had a similar experience or have any advice on what I could do, I would greatly appreciate it because my everyday life has become so painful. I can't do anything but feel sick all day, and I can't endure it anymore. Any advice will be appreciated.

418,AskDocs,"I got covid for the first time in April of 2021. My symptoms weren’t extremely bad. However I couldn’t taste anything for a while. Eventually I got okay and all my symptoms went.
4-5 months later, I could smell something sulphuric. This smell came on a random evening. At first I thought the smell was coming from outside but when I asked around none of my family members could smell it. I took a bath thrice to make sure that the smell wasn’t coming from me, but it didn’t help. 
I ended up having one of the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had because of the constant pungent smell. 
My parents rushed me to the hospital where they just checked my vitals and gave me glucose. 
This smell stayed with me for another 4 months. In this time I visited multiple doctors and psychologists. I still do not know whether this smell was something psychological or due to covid. And if it were due to covid- how come it occurred months after I got okay? 
I had to change my diet a lot as I couldn’t stand a lot of foods which gave out that smell. These foods didn’t really having anything in common I think (chicken, lentils, certain vegetables). 


Fast forward a year I got covid again but this time my symptoms were extremely mild. 


Currently, this is my third time getting covid and I’m getting paranoid about the smell coming back again. I had a little whiff of it today and that just made me spiral into everything which happened two years back. 

I would like to understand the cause for this and if there’s anything I can do to avoid the smell or the panic.

I'm a 30 y/o Male.  Non smoker, no drug use, and used to drink casually (but haven't had a drink in a year due to nausea). I'm 6' about 145 lbs.

I've been dealing with fairly debilitating chronic nausea since January 2022. There were periods of near daily vomiting/dry heaving from January 2022-May 2022 and from late October 2022-January 2022. Vomiting gas been very infrequent since.

The nausea destroys my appetite and I cant hold food down. I've lost over 30 lbs and I've always been lean to begin with.

I've undergone countless tests and am now seeing a terrific GI. Currently,everything is normal or illnesses/conditions identified have been remediated.

I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in July 2022 and was relieved at the time to have an answer. Second endoscopy results just came back and my villi have basically fully recovered due to effective GF diet.

I was flagged for norovirus in January, but have been cleared of it since. Same with SIBO in February, remediated with antibiotics.

Yet still, no improvement in symptoms.

Over the past 16 months, I've tried countless medications:

-famitodine at several doses

-hyoscyamine 

-Zofran/onadesteron

-Antibiotics to rid of norovirus and SIBO

-Every OTC nausea supplement and medication under the sun 

-Reglan

-Currently on amitriptyline (30 mg) and may titrate up further for functional nausea treatment.

I am on NO other medications other than amitriptyline right now.

Otherwise, generally a healthy person. Although I've experienced manageable anxiety/depression before, I haven't experienced much of either in the past year. I've tried meditation too, but nausea has no correlation to any stress or anxiety.

I just want my life back. My job allows me to work from home, and that's about all I can do. I want to be able to. I just want a normal life back where I can exercise vigorously and eat normally again, and also not live in perpetual discomfort.

Since so many conditions have been ruled out, I'm thinking it's a neuromuscular disorder or Brian gut communication issue, and that's how it's currently being treated, but with no results.

Please help, this has gone on for WAY too long with virtually no improvement.

I had a colonoscopy 5 years ago due to similar symptoms, along with my dad being diagnosed that year as well, and nothing was found besides hemorrhoids. But I’m still scared. Can colon cancer develop that fast in 5 years? Am I overreacting? My current GI doctor did a digital exam and thinks it’s a fissure, but I don’t feel and burning pain.

I am pretty certain it's still in there as my hearing is muffled, and I can feel something in there which is uncomfortable.

432,AskDocs,"Will post significant info below, but essentially, one day I woke up with mild pain in my left shoulder blade. Felt like muscle tension around my infraspinatus. Over a day or two the very mild pain grew to mild pain, and started travelling to my left tricep. This continued to worsen and travel down my arm/into my left pectoral until it became more than just a nuisance and was instead pain. I initially was worried and thought I had high blood pressure/was having a heart attack, as this was new unique pain to me. My wife (an ER PA) assured me I was fine (as she is wont to do), took my vitals and confirmed I was fine.

Pain continued to worsen for about 2 weeks. It got to the point where everyday activities would cause pain to shoot down my left side- puttting on shoes, picking up my 8 month old son, sitting in the car/at my desk for an extended period of time for work, etc. Pain was at a baseline of 3-4 but would shoot up to 8-9 if I didn't rest/ice and let it get bad enough. 

Went to my PCP, got an x-ray order, he said looks like vertebral space between C6/C7 looked narrow. Got the MRI order, impression was ""moderate left and mild right foraminal stenosis at C6-C7 due to uncovertebral osteophytes"". Got a prescription for gabapentin, hydrocodone, and a muscle relaxer. The gaba seems to help me sleep, the hydrocodone sort of helps, but the pain is always there. Tylenol/ibuprofen don't touch it. Rest/Icing definitely helps, but only for a short time. 

I haven't slept through the night in a month and a half, no matter what I do or what I take, I wake up in the middle of the night in a 7-8/10 pain. I struggle downstairs to grab ice and lie down, and eventually the rest/ice combo helps it to subside. Being on my back is the only comfortable position. I tend to sleep on my side/stomach, so I would roll over in the night which would incite the pain. Since then, I have placed pillows to prevent myself from rolling over, which has helped, but I am still waking up every night. If I take nothing, I'm usually up all night (not an exaggeration, I am unable to fall asleep and the pain is too constant for me to fall asleep, so I literally get no sleep). I have been taking 1-3 gabapentin/night, which I believe has helped- since doing that, I wake up 2-4 times/night, but am able to get back to sleep relatively quickly. If I take the gaba+hydrocodone, then I usually wake up 1-2 times and am able to fall right back asleep. But obviously I am cognizant and hesitant to relying on the opioid, but I'm getting to the point where I desperately need sleep.

I got on the schedule for a steroid injection into the space. That was 3+ weeks ago, never got any relief from it. I went to the ortho who said, after second look at the MRI, it looked more ""mechanical""and he doubted the steroid would work. He still said we could give it a second try, sometimes patients react positively to the second shot, but by now I was ""probably at the end of my rope"" and should consider surgery.

Also am seeing a PT. She's great (she rehab'd my right shoulder twice from two shoulder surgeries, my right arm is 110% now). After going through the initial ROM measurements/ doing some strengthening exercises, she did some massage. She said my left side was incredibly tight, which was to be expected. I asked her about e-stim or a TENS unit, she said let's try some e-stim while I was there. She put the nodes on my left and right upper traps/neck. She put it on some low setting, turned it on, and my left side LIT UP. The whole muscles contracted extremely vigorously. She said that's odd, and started turning it down. This continued, my left upper trap contracting hard every time. Eventually, she turned it to the lowest possible setting. I felt virtually nothing on my right side, but my left trap still tightly contracted with each stim. She said that was extremely odd, and that she had never seen a muscle respond to the lowest setting before.

My three questions are therefore:

* should I worry about getting this second injection? I read mixed reviews online, and it seems like its not even an FDA-approved procedure? I have a surgery scheduled for May 19th, but my thoughts are I want to throw everything at this (injection/PT/etc) and if it gets better, cancel the surgery. Surgeon agreed this was a good course of action. I'm already at my deductible so cost isn't so much an issue, I just don't want the injection if it more than likely isn't going to help.

* What do you make of the e-stim situation? Does that suggest any severity of this issue, or just that my musculature/nerves are all extremely tight in my back?

* How do I ask for more pain medication without sounding drug-seeking? I spoke with my psychologist about this, how I am afraid to get addicted or sound drug-seeking, but she assured me that this is what the medication was for, and that if I'm not sleeping the rest of my physical/mental health will suffer, which I am seeing in spades. She advised I count the days to my surgery, figure out exactly how many I need, subtract what I already have, and ask them for that amount. Assuring them I have an open dialogue with my wife, psych, and PCP about the medication should help. I just can't shake the ""dirty"" feeling of sounding like I'm seeking a drug.

Advice would be so appreciated here

UK, 28F, 110kg, 5'6, non smoker, 
medication: duloxectine, gabapentin and sumatriptan.
Conditions: chronic migraine,   cluster headaches, adhd, depression 

I know this seems really stupid but its causing me a lot of distress at the moment. Any advice would be massively appreciated.

I understand that this is more of a mental health thing so no worries if not relevant to the sub

Over the last month or 2 it seems as though a switch has flipped in my brain. I have always been incredibly sensitive (to my detriment), emotional and pretty affectionate with my loved ones. I have also never had any issues with my libido. 

However, this has all disappeared over the last couple of months. I am so flat and emotionless that I have to genuinley figure out what the correct human response should be when talking to people. I feel absolutely numb most of the time. My childhood cat even passed away last month and I didnt shed a tear. All my energy was spent consoling my mum. 

I have a pretty stressful job, so much so that I was off for 2 weeks with stress back in March. On my days off, all I want to do is sleep. Socialising, errands, showering, cleaning feel almost physically painful because I am so fatigued.

Then there is my sex drive - or the lack of it. I have always had a really high sex drive and have been very physically affectionate. Now, being touched makes me want to vomit. Even the sensation of my clothes on my skin or somone brushing up against me makes me cringe,angry and sick. I have no interest in sex at all. I just want to isolate myself.

I know I have depression but I have never felt like this before. Ive always been the ""emotional one"" and now showing any emotion or taking an interest in things drains all my energy. I also live with chronic pain so can often be fatigued from that.

What I really want to know is if this will pass? What can I do to be ""me"" again? 

I was referred to my local mental health services back in March but I will likely be waiting nearly a year for treatment. I live in an incredibly rural area and getting to see my GP is difficult. I would prefer to manage this myself rather than take an appointment  from somone who needs it.

For context we live in the Philippines. Her doctor told us last November that she's going to be in some kind of care (i forgot the term), basically telling us that she probably doesn't even have a year left.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer on her left breast August of 2012, then in the later years she got a myoma, bladder cancer, and now bone cancer. I don't remember when she was diagnosed regarding the last two but the myoma was found around the same time as breast.

Right now she's taking morphine, and morphine MST. She takes MST every 6 hours and the plain morphine is her rescue dose in case the pain doesn't subside even an hour later. There are days where she doesn't feel the pain at all and would even be active/energetic but wont eat.

Right now I just really need help on how to help ease the pain. She ran out of MST today and my family is on their way to the drugstores (they're very hard to acquire) to get a new batch, and she hasn't stopped screaming and crying about the pain. We had a box of Targin left, it was her meds for pain management for a while before we switched to Morphine, so we made her take that.

Disclaimer: I know this is a long post but please I beg you to read it, it is long so that I do not leave out any details.

For the past 3 years I have had an intense stiffness in my right torso. When it started it made it impossible for me to workout and I started seeing physio-therapists. The main issue was pain in the front of the neck on the right side, above the collarbone, which was triggered by pushing exercises, especially overhead. The front of the neck (right side) felt really stiff. I also experienced stinging feelings in right arm and shoulder. The physio-therapists diagnosed me with TOS and prescribed rehab exercises. My problems persisted and I stopped working out completely which removed the front neck pain as well as the swelling in the chest right under the collarbone, under the painful area that had formed. Right around this time is also where my anxiety started, previously I had been completely free from any mental distress.

So for about 2 years I did not workout, took anxiety meds and met with a psychologist, and tried to live life as normal as possible. 

During the fall of 2022, I decided to try working out again. Aware of the pain in the front neck that always arose with upperbody exercise, I decided to try to mobilize the shoulder and chest area before starting to train. I also visited a chiropractor who recommended me some exercises to open up the chest area. Again nothing really worked, my muscles on the right side just seemed to contract and become hardened and achy after rehab exercises and diligent stretching. It was at this moment I realized the my entire right torso was really stiff, not just my chest and shoulder.

In a random moment, just during a normal day, I felt a release of my stiffness in my torso when twisting my hip. I started to do hip exercises, with some success in remedying my stiffness. I noticed that the more release I had in upper body, my anxiety felt alot better, like alot. Most distinctively, I remember a very comforting feeling in my stomach and I felt alot stronger when tensing the sphincter muscle. There was just a relief really, and in my stomach I felt much more stable than I had felt in a long long time. It felt like the old anxiety thoughts just did not bite on me anymore. I figured it was the TOS I had been diagnosed with that caused compression on nerves, and now some of that flow was able to pass down giving me control and sensation I had lost for a while. It was the best I've felt easily since my mental health decline in the start of 2020. 

I did however notice that quite far from the entire stiffness was gone, and I continued to hip exercises with no success. Some of them really hurted, and it felt like they were inhibited by other stiffnessess. I tried to stretch seemingly every lower and upper body, back and front muscles with no success, with little to no success, trying new things over and over month after month. But, 2 weeks ago I had another breakthrough, I noticed that stretching my big toe aided the stiffness alot , even more than the hips did initially. I started to stretch my right big toe. Stretching the big toe, mobilizing it etc, made some good releases in my upper body. I could not believe it, how that could be working. 

I started to ponder why my toe could have a releasing effect in my upperbody, and looking at it, it was quite red and swollen, but no pain in it. I reminisced that about some years ago, I developed for a short while, a bad habit of pressing my nail into my toe with my foot under my desk, sort of like a ticks. It gave a gnarly, yucky burning sensation right below the nail, and it felt kind of bad, so I stopped doing it at the time. 

To see if this could have damaged my toe in anyway, I repetead the motion a week ago, pushing the toe inward,  and it shoot stiffness throughout my right side torso immediately, worse than ever had before. I felt immediatly how my right shoulder crumbled down and how my chest contracted immensly, how my neck became stiffer than ever, and shortly after, the anxiety went crazy. My stomach started feeling really strange, like its full of butterflies all the time constantly, and I cant feel if I am full or empty. And my sphincter got alot weaker to now where it is a struggle to pee. 

I panicked and spent the next days in a frenzy trying to pull the nail outward, researching symptoms, but to no success. Alot of the time I just managed to push on the nail more which worsened all my symptoms. More stiffness and more anxiety.

Now the toe has started to numb, and i feel hot flashes running up my leg. The anxiety is not even anxiety anymore, its just panic, panic, panic. There are not certain thoughts that trigger anxiety, its just constant fight or flight. None of the doctors I have met during this last week have bought into the idea that a nerve in big toe can cause stiffness in the entire upper torso, and have just touched my hands and arms and asked if I sense them, which I do, and ruled out any nerve damage. I asked about TOS, which I at the time believed to be the culprit, to which I was replied that its not dangerous and just a sensation, so just wait until it subsides.

After this, doing some research on my own (I know you are not supposed to diagnose yourself, which is why i am writing on here), I read about the vagus nerve, and of course, I am not doctor, but alot of it matched my symptoms on the spot. Weak sphincter, awful gut feeling and loss of gut sensation, unable to control body from panicking.

I dont believe I have vagus nerve damage, but I do believe that it is inhibited by my extraordinarily stiff front neck. This would also explain why I am not experiencing any vagus issues above my neck, such as trouble swallowing. As well as the fact that, looking back, my history of neck stiffness seems to mirror my poor mental health. As well as the swelling and pain I experienced in the front right neck when trying to workout with the stiffness. But of course this is just speculation from my part, again I am not an expert. 

Please share any insight in what I could be suffering from, in any regard of all the nerve pain from the foot that seems to make my right upper torso incredibly tight, as well has the neck stiffness and vagus nerve symptoms I believe I have.

New/worsened symptoms from the last ~two months that are causing concern are increased weakness (I’ve always been weaker than I should be), pain levels have increased significantly (again, pain is normal but not at this level) inability to walk without a walking stick **all the time** (only needed sporadically before the last six months but in the last two months it has become a necessity), legs folding under me on the stairs &amp; when walking for more than a few minutes, stomach muscles trembling/vibrating when sat up without something to lean back on, “dropped head syndrome”, difficulty chewing &amp; swallowing after eating a few mouthfuls, some urinary retention, increasingly weak arms &amp; difficulty sitting up from lying down.*

Urgent MRI results state that things are mostly unchanged since previous scans but that I have a small amount of bulging in the discs in my neck. Syrinx is apparently unchanged (T6-T10, most prominent at T8). Lordosis issues throughout spine meaning my neck is too straight &amp; my lumbar spine too curved. I did ask for this scan to include contrast but my GP failed to ask for this.

A few years back I tried getting an IUD and long story short it went horribly. The insertion was difficult and very painful and my doctor said it was because I have a
""curly Q cervix"" and when I asked for elaboration he said my cervix is ""shaped like a pig's tail"". It ended up lasting not even a month before I had painful bleeding (actual blood, not menstrual blood). I had done light googling at the time and saw it meant I had a lower chance of getting pregnant which was fine be me since I'm child free.
Fast forward to last night fertility came up in conversation with my boyfriend and I said I didn't think I was and explained the above. He wanted to know more and upon googling now, years later, I am finding nothing about a ""curly q cervix"", only endometriosis. Here's the scary part- I have every other symptom. Those symptoms include, but are not limited to, ovarian cysts, painful periods with abnormally short menstrual windows, pain during and after sex, horrendous Gl issues leading up to and during my period, fatigue/low energy, etc. All these symptoms my (former) OBGYN was aware of.
Is there any reason why my doctor wouldn't have tested for this? Should I pursue testing or am I letting Google scare me? What does a curly q cervix actually mean?

So, as the title states, I'm a 31YO female, 175cm/90ish kg (sorry, European so metric units), no medications, no serious medical issues, I don't smoke nor use drugs, and am an occasional drinker.

I’ve had an MRI done on my left knee because my doctor thinks I have a ruptured ACL after a skiing accident. I got into some soft snow, my ski wouldn’t unhook and my knee had quite a rotation. It hurt like hell for a few weeks, and the knee was pretty unstable, but i kept telling myself it’s nothing. I didn’t go to the doctor then, it’s been a year now and a few weeks ago, while doing jumping jacks in the gym, my knee just collapsed (inward). It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life, like someone sliced my knee in half. 

Since then, my knee has become a lot more unstable, I can’t make any sudden movements, I can’t bend it nor keep it completely straight. So I finally went to the doctor. He did a checkup and immediately suspected that the ACL is torn. He suggested to do an MRI, which I did and just got the scans. I’m supposed to bring them to the doc on Monday, as I said, but my curiosity got the best of me and I plugged in the usb woth the scans and took a look. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, everything looks like a Picasso painting to me haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what stands out is this bright white blob above the knee so naturally I came here to ask you, dear Reddit doctors, what am I looking at? :D

I had full body psoriasis and on my face and used UVB treatment in 2020. It went well for my body but I was left with spots of psoriasis on my face which where manageable with protopic.  

However the last 6 months my face has got very bad and protopic cannot control it anymore. I have some on my privates but can manage with creams. 

I also started to get more pimples and spots on my cheek, the protopic helps with the dry skin (not 100%) but not with the red or weird pimple things. And after the 6 week use when I taper off it just comes back. I am not often in the sun and when I am I wear a wide brim hat since protopic you can’t be in the sun. So it’s not sun irritation. 

I have recently been to the dermatologist and they have no idea what it is. They think maybe it’s seb derm and rosacea with spots of psoriasis. 

On the psoriasis spots around my hairline I am told to use protopic and on my face to try Soolantra. 

If that doesn’t work I might need to try UVB only on my face as it’s not anywhere else and then next stop methotrexate. 


Does my picture look like rosacea? This is really getting me down. They want me on this for 3 months but my kids and kids friends are literally scared of my face and my kids don’t want to hug me as they don’t want to get it (only young). 

So I’m not sure if I should just go back and start UVB treatment or keep on Soolantra for 3months.",t2_7sqd9t541,0,Psoriasis or rosacea or seb derm on my face?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12qlfrd,True,happy4awhile,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12qlfrd/psoriasis_or_rosacea_or_seb_derm_on_my_face/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12qlfrd/psoriasis_or_rosacea_or_seb_derm_on_my_face/,475632,1681820955,0,,False,1681820974,1681820974,2023-04-18 12:29:15,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=260f3207be0abb66a2da51192b39626e9cf60452', 'width': 1125, 'height': 1729}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c7c17f4c301414537a0d40b43a7fde423d79dab', 'width': 108, 'height': 165}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5b3fbb45609dd9a72e328889b6351f7d466a898b', 'width': 216, 'height': 331}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2760655b3b37728e63c49954781cdd5dca19de1', 'width': 320, 'height': 491}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77c657542ea277c256e4502c709f5a492815b41f', 'width': 640, 'height': 983}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7095525eee91416a9b1b117505ec9cbfad8b1ab3', 'width': 960, 'height': 1475}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/J0uTAAXRPDCpUpR0cMQlbzfnYblf3ImKuK-bv6Avy0Y.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88c130aec345e1d89bab8296bd2de340259de496', 'width': 1080, 'height': 1659}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '9RObZhcruu3HQ18_pxtDXRu4IGQACMzryGwi39TFpZM'}], 'enabled': False}",

This is a bit embarrassing 29f 30m

Ive been with my husband 17 years, every once in a while I notice his sperm burns my mouth if it gets inside of it. Like a tingling effect. This isnt every time, it use to be far more frequent.

It actually hadnt in a good amount of time, but over the weekend some of his sperm ended up on my face and burned where it touched to what looked like a chemical burn. Its still peeling... 

Like a bad sunburn.

On top of that, I started getting a UTI the day after, and now its the worst UTI I ever experienced.

I would assume it would be an allergy, but again.. Its not always. This is the first time its even left behind a rash where its touched.

As far as i know he hasnt eaten/done anything outside of his usual day to day pattern. Ive never been with anyone else so Im not sure if its just him.

He hes no visable rash on his penis, and says he has no pain/complaints.

I was in the shower and it suddenly came out of nowhere in the left side of my chest and shoulder as well as my upper back between my shoulder blades. My chest felt heavy, I was dizzy and in immense pain. I got out of the shower and started panicking so I laid down to try and calm down. The pain stayed in the left side of my chest the entire time but the back pain moved from the middle to my left shoulder more and then it radiated down my arm. I had to drive somewhere so after the dizziness subsided, I stopped at a gas station and grabbed aspirin in case it got worse again. Throughout my drive, the pain in my back radiated across to the right side of my shoulder blade and down my right arm while the left side chest pain stayed. The rest of the night, my shoulders were tense and burning. I wasn’t sweating or nauseous at all during any of this. Usually when I’m in the shower, my heart rate increases a lot and I get dizzy. My legs and feet go blue, but not cold. 

I’m a 24 year old female who takes adderall and effexor daily. I vape and drink coffee. I am usually fairly stressed about work. I’m 5’6” and weigh 135 lbs. I have exercise/allergy induced asthma, anxiety, ADHD, Raynauds. 

My heart rate usually hits about 140-155+ bpm when I stand. My sitting heart rate can be around 80-90. I’ve noticed that lately sometimes out of every 5-10 beats, one is extremely hard and loud. Sometimes just laying down, my boyfriend can sit next to me and hear my heart beating because it’s so hard. 

Family history of heart issues:
Mom’s late mom had a heart murmur, palpitations and angina? (I think).

Dad’s late dad had pacemaker/diabetes.

Dad’s mom this year had about 4 heart attacks at age 82 this year and has 4 stents. She has high blood pressure as well as my father (I don’t though). 

I know I need to get my heart issues checked out, but was what happened last week a sign to get it checked by a cardiologist literally as soon as possible because it’s concerning? Or maybe it’s from my Adderall and I just need to talk to GP at my next physical? Not sure the level of concern here. :/ If anyone has any thoughts on what this could be, that would be so nice to hear.

462,AskDocs,"Hi docs! 

Firstly let me preface this by saying I put lymph nodes in inverted commas mainly because I'm not ENTIRELY sure. I've been for consultations and my GP agreed with me but I'm just putting it there to make the question not so close ended. 

I have a few palpable bumps in my neck. Biggest one is probably about 1cm or so in diameter with many smaller ones around. More information about them to follow.

Position: on my neck, main one directly inferior to ear.
Consistency: soft, movable lump. Has the consistency of a tiny ripe tomato, so somewhat firm but not hard or rubbery. 
Pain: None at all
Changes: None, been consistently the same for a long time.
First noticed: famous 4 to 5 years ago. I know it's been at least 4 years. Since first noticing it, no significant changes, very consistent.
Other symptoms: absolutely none. I am a relatively healthy individual. Odd bout of flu or sinusitis aside to that nothing at all. No weight loss, no night sweats, nothing of note aside to some weight gain when starting serdep (SSRI).
Other medication: neucon 54mg (ADHD) and 50mg serdep (anxiety).

Should I be concerned? As I said I've had no other symptoms, no health issues and nothing else of concern including my GP saying he thinks it is not of concern. What could be the cause? Has anyone seen these ""constantly palpable"" lymph nodes before as I've heard they generally aren't palpable in healthy individuals?

467,AskDocs,"Hello. I am a fairly fit 155 pound 5 foot 10 26 year old male non smoker, moderate drinker (1 drink a week). But the past 2 months ive had health issues. 
I'm just gonna start at the beginning. Around the end of January/early February I was singing and I hit a high note. I immediately felt a sensation in my adams apple like something was in there and I did something wrong so I stopped singing. This sensation of having something in my adams apple continued for about a week and then went away however sometimes when I laughed or coughed I would get the sensation that there was something in my adams apple. I also lost my ability to sing for more than 5 seconds and couldn't even attempt high notes. These were my only symptoms. No hoarseness. Nothing. 

About a week after those symptoms stopped I went into a coughing fit randomly. After the coughing fit I could feel like something was in my adams apple again which went away after a few minutes and I got a sore throat. This sore throat lasted a few days and went away. At this point my only symptoms were an inability to sing high notes and a feeling like something was in my adams apple sometimes when I coughed, cleared my throat, or laughed. 

A month in (beginning of March) I scheduled an appointment with an ENT doc. She felt my lymph nodes, took my temp, and did a laryngoscopy where she shoved a camera through my nose to look at my vocal cords. She found nothing. Said my vocal cords looked great and told me she could refer me to a speech therapist if I wanted and to come back for continuing or worsening symptoms.

Over the next 3-4 weeks my singing seemed to gradually get a little better although the improvement wasn't much. I still got a feeling in my adams apple sometimes however there was an additional symptom. I started getting sore throats with excessive throat clearing and coughing. I would have a sore throat for 3-5 days which would turn into throat clearing and coughing, and then it would go away for about a 5-7 days and then the sore throat would come right back. 
On my 3rd sore throat of the month it just felt different. The sore throat came on very suddenly. I was just sitting there on the couch without a sore throat then the next second i had a sore throat. I shined a camera into my throat and noticed what I assumed was post nasal drip. I made another appointment with the ENT.  I took a picture to show the doc.

I had my 2nd ENT appointment in early April three days into my 3rd sore throat. At that time the sore throst was still there but had died down considerably. The first 2 days of that 3rd sore throat felt like sandpaper and razorblades. The doc looked at my picture and confirmed it looked like post nasal drip and asked if anyone else around me was getting sick. The answer was no. Asked if i had any allergies. The answer was not to my knowledge. Asked if I had acid reflux. I said i didnt think so because I didnt have any heartburn and always sleep slightly sitting up. She looked at my throat and did a throat culture which came back negative. Prescribed me amoxicillin antibiotics anyway for some reason and told me of the sore throat came back after the antibiotics were done she wanted to do a CT scan of my throat. I'm not one to go against what the doctor says so I just took the amoxicillin. After all I've had amoxicillin before and never have any issues except a mild headache.

That appointment was last Wednesday. The sore throat was gone by Friday and replaced by throat clearing and coughing for a couple of days which went away yesterday, Monday. However yesterday I noticed a new symptom while I was working. I got the feeling that something was in my throat. Not in my adams apple like before but almost like I had something sitting on top of my epiglottis. This feeling has not gone away yet although it's only been a day since it started.

it’s itchy. i had spontaneous anal sex recently. i was also wearing a thong. and i think maybe some fecal matter from the thong might have gotten onto my butt cheek when i pulled it to the side as i was walking back to work (was on break). i wiped my butt and g string at work but didn’t shower when i got home from work i don’t think. usually shower before work

it appeared like the next day after having anal sex. it was a small itchy bump but didn’t look at it so i don’t know what it looked like. but thought it was a mosquito bite. it’s now itchy and dry and i took a picture. it’s a dry white dot with red around it.

485,AskDocs,"So this is my first time posting here. I am concerned because this thing has been happening for like 3 years. So I (27m afab) have this weird neurological issue that has been recurring in my life and gets in the way massively. I will suddenly just start to look  up at the ceiling out of nowhere occasionally and I won't be able to keep my eyes from rolling up at the ceiling, it looks like my eyes are rolling back to other people. To me I'm just constantly looking up and I can't concentrate or do much mentally except sleep it off. And this lasts for hours or until I sleep. It scares everyone who knows me,and I have went to the neurologist and been told it wasn't an immediate concern. Everyone who i tell about this says it seems like a type of seizure but the neurologist I went to disagrees. I'm worried that this could be a very bad thing,so I wanted to see what others say. I am a 27 year old Trans man  who has a list of mental problems, Anxiety disorder, severe depression (medicated),ocd and I am very sure I have ADHD but have never been formally diagnosed or medicated. I have fibromyalgia,and recurring Bell's Palsy as I have had it 2 major times in my life and it never went away.
I take Trazodone,Cymbalta,Prazosin, Abilify,and Buspirone and I smoke Marijuana a lot as I use it to self medicate. I hope this is enough information for this,again ask me anything you possibly need! I really want to know what this could possibly be.

490,AskDocs," 

39F, 5'7"", 128lbs, white. Generally really healthy honestly. Never smoked, social drinker, and I walk 6-7 miles every day.

**Existing diagnoses:** OCD, anxiety, depression

**Current Medication:** Xanax 0.25 - 0.5mg as needed (not taken often)

**Complaint:** Sleep issues and night sweats for 3 straight months, every night. The sweats *always* accompany a wake-up from extremely vivid dreams, though they are not nightmares. I will sleep for 3-4 hours, then wake up from a dream with the backs of my legs dripping with sweat. This will continue with me falling into another vivid dream and waking up with legs sweating about an hour later.. goes on until the morning.

I'm not drenching the bed and it is ONLY the back of my legs my legs and knee pits that sweat. After a full night of 'episodes' the sheets under my legs will be a little damp. My head, armpits, shirt, etc... are all dry.

**Other Info:** The sleep problems started 2 weeks after I recovered from a fairly mild Covid infection (my first one ever). It was also during a period of extremely crushing stress and anxiety about some other issues that are still ongoing, but even when I go to bed NOT feeling anxious, the vivid dreams and leg sweats still show up.

I realize I'm almost 40 so perimenopause isn't off the table, though I'll mention that my periods are regular and normal and I've had no obvious changes to my cycle during all of this.

**Tests I've Had:**

\- Brain MRI with IAC, with and without contrast, 2 weeks ago. Results were normal. This was not done because of the sweats, but because of some longstanding tinnitus and lingering dizziness from a vestibular neuritis years ago. Covid worsened both of those symptoms and it worried me.

\- Hearing test and tympanometry. Results normal. This was also done for the symptoms above, not for the sweats.

\- Blood tests (CBC, TSH, liver and kidney, fasted glucose). All normal except my WBC was 3.6 (ref range started at 3.8 or 4). Doctor told me not to worry at all about it since I don't get sick frequently or contract infections.

\- Vestibular testing. This revealed a 'weakness' in my right ear that uncovered what my doctor thinks is leftover from an old vestibular neuritis from a couple of violent vertigo attacks I had years ago (I've had intermittent mild rocking dizziness since then, but it got way worse after Covid).

\- I've taken my temperature during several of the sweaty-dream wake-ups and it is always normal, around 97.4 which is my norm. So I don't think I'm spiking fevers during the night.

\- I don't have any swollen lymph nodes in my neck, collarbone area, or groin.

**What's Been Tried:**

So my doctor thinks that because I had the worsening tinnitus/dizziness as well as loss of taste/smell for 2 weeks from Covid, that it's likely it also messed with something neurologically and is causing these lingering sleep problems. He thinks through habituation to the tinnitus, physical therapy to get me back to my normal for the dizziness, and just... time... things will improve with my sleep as well. He thinks it may be a form of long Covid, but he's just guessing of course.

My psychiatrist, of course, thinks it's all anxiety (and yes, my anxiety HAS been chronically high for a long time now) and put me on a low dose of Amitriptyline at bed to help with sleep and ""dry me out"" but it did nothing.

**Overall Question:**

So obviously, you Google 'night sweats' and get a lot of scary stuff. I'm sick of seeing doctors over this and my other issues and really would like to get back to my life and see if, with time, it will stop.

My question... is it safe to do that? With my specific symptoms and the tests I've had done so far, should I just put this to rest, work on lowering my anxiety, and try to move on? Did COVID maybe do something to my ANS? Or should I be seeking other tests?

Thanks SO much for reading and taking time for me. I'm exhausted and terrified of what is going on with me, and because I have an existing anxiety disorder it seems like that's the easy go-to.

Back in 2016 I (then age 53 and apparently healthy) had one of those days. Still not sure what affected me. Any suggestions welcomed.

I woke up at 5am as usual and travelled 2 hours to work in Edinburgh on the bus. Halfway there I was going through in my mind what I had on that day and realised I could not remember the names of my colleagues. I worked in an office of 30 people and spent all day there 5 days a week, had done for 5 years. This freaked me out somewhat but I got to work. An hour later at my desk I took a drink of water and promptly blacked out, fell off my chair. Wasn't injured and came to 10 seconds later. Colleagues sent me to hospital where I spent a day being checked before being sent home. I felt ok before and after the episode. I'd had no alcohol in days before this by the way, and was on no medication.

I had the usual heart monitors etc. which revealed a heart arrhythmia with ventricular fibrillation. It hadn't happened before (nor since, I've been ok since this occurance in 2016). Over the course of that day my memory of names returned....though I have since retired and forgotten the names again!

The heart issue thankfully hasn't happened again, but my short term memory is not great. I forget names very easily, like within an hour, I almost have to write them down.

While the medics explained the heart issue they never mentioned the memory problem.

I have wondered since whether it was a minor stroke that wiped a bit of my brain? It felt like when you lose your keys, you know what they look like but can't pin them down. Very odd. As both things happened within hours I assume they were connected?

Anyone who can suggest a cause of the memory loss would be being very helpful. As I say I've been ok since heart-wise but my memory of names is poor.

495,AskDocs,"Numbness in Hand and Face

Hello,

I am ( 28F , 200lbs) on blood pressure medication (Losartan 50 HCTZ 12.5) and my doc recently upped the mg dosage on it to Losartan 100 HCTZ 12.5 on Friday 4/14.  I have been experiencing face and hand numbness on my left side for a few days now. The numbness episodes happen usually when I’m asleep/falling asleep/or it wakes me up at like 3:00am. 

I went to the ER today because my blood pressure was 171/116 before I went to ER and 180/99 when I was admitted. It then dropped quickly but stayed at about 151/90. I also experienced seeing spots in my vision and couldn’t read or focus on anything. This episode lasted about 30 minutes but the numbness and drastic high blood pressure lasted for hours. I felt dismissed by the ER doc since he wasn’t really listening to me and said something like they have multiple cases like this come in each day.

I now write this sitting in bed at 4:30am after being woken up from my hand and face going numb yet again. I should also note that I’m also currently on antibiotics for a UTI. This is my third round of antibiotics and I’ve had symptoms for a little over a month since it won’t seem to go away. I am also on oral birth control.

Long story short, I am terrified of what’s happening to me and all Google says is that it’s a possible stroke or upcoming stroke? I’m scared that I’m going to repeat yesterdays events today and have my blood pressure spike really high so any advice you could give would be great.

502,AskDocs,"29 yo, male, 6′ 0″ (183cm) , 170 lbs (78kg), Caucasian, located in Austria, duration of complaint: 6 months, medication: sucralfate, pantoprazole, desloratadine

My gastric issues started as an unspecific sensation of nausea, relieved by bloating (burping) and food. Treated by a 28 day daily intake of 20mg pantoprazole 30 min prior the first meal of the day, as prescribed by GP

Success was temporary, symptoms changed to a very high senstivity to specific large meals for dinner. Surprisingly: No issues with beef, burgers, fries, cheese, beef tortillas - sleeping just fine. Even large amounts of beef will settle my stomach.

Big issues with: Curries, vegetables such as broccoli, lentils, pumpkin, soy productsspicy sauces, coconut milk, soups, anything using soy sauce, MSG, yeast extract etc.

Symptoms got worse over the course of the past 2 months. Empty stomach tends to cause a dull pain, sometimes cramps relieved by bloating. Can't tolerate very acidic foods or painkilles (ibuprofene). Chocolate and foods high in sugar give me a burning sensation in the espohagus.

GP ordered helicobacter pylori breath test which turned out negative, diagnosed gastritis and now prescribed 40 mg of pantoprazole to take 30 min. prior breakfast and sucralfate to take 30 min. before the other meals of the day and before bedtime on empty stomach.

Sucralfate provides temporary relief, sticking to smaller meals avoiding spicy foods and foods high in sugar helps.

But if I ever deviate from this, I will get bad reactions fast.

Yesterday I had a large portion of curry for dinner (3h prior bedtime) which was not too spicy at all but had a lot of undercooked broccoli and zucchini in it and I had the worst morning of the year. I woke up with an unbearable pressure in my head, blodshoot eyes, a very tense body sensation making me gasp for air like experiencing panic and my heart race, which was  succesively relieved by bloating and a small breakfast consisting of dark bread and oats.

I also take desloratadine to help me sleep because of my dust mite allergy.

I was also tested for lactose and fructose intolerance and both results turned out negative.

It's a very weird and troublesome combination of symptoms. I am suspecting some sort of intolerance to something (maybe histamine?) because if it's just the gastric symptoms, why can I eat burgers and red meat without any gastric issues at all? If I eat beef burgers for dinner I sleep very well and wake up rested, but a chicken curry will make my body go nuts.
I can't even tolerate the ol' dry chicken with rice and broccoli well, it just  seems that my body has an issue with veggies? It's even worse with tofu or soy products, they make me nauseous for some reason.

I have another appointment with my GP to let him know about my gastric symptoms getting worse and hopefully can convince him to get a gastroscopy, because these symptoms really affect my everyday life quality massively.

503,AskDocs,"Hi, I’m 27F. 

About 6 years ago, I had breast lumps:
- Lump 1: over 2 cm
- Lump 2: cannot be felt
No biopsy was taken but it was diagnosed as likely fibroedenoma. I was given a choice to remove lump 1 or not and I decided not to due to various reasons. 

Currently, I’ve discovered new lumps:
- Lump 3: small but obvious bean sized lump
- Lump 4: small bean lump
- possible lump 5 awaiting scan details
I went to the doctor again to check the new lumps and proceed with the removal of Lump 1. I also wish to remove lump 3&amp;4 since I can feel them, especially lump 3 as it is small but a very clear lump. I feel quite bothered by it.

I went to a big hospital that provide both subsidised and private healthcare. Since I’m unaware of the surgical costs, I went subsidised route first. The doctor told me quite certainly that they won’t remove lumps that are smaller than 2cm and that means they will only remove lump 1.

I wish to ask is this a common rule among all possible cases of fibroedenoma? Since I’m going for a surgery, I wish I can remove at least lump 3 too. Is it unwise of me to insist on the removal of lump 3 too? I’m not sure if this is because I’m going the subsidised route too.

504,AskDocs,"**Background:** 23, male, non-smoker/drinker, generally healthy with no known underlying conditions, normal weight and exercising regularly. I take low-dose Accutane (3 months into my second 8 month course of 10mg/day—had no issues on first course so don't think it's related), methylphenidate (20mg twice a day, been on it for 2-3 years) and sertraline (50mg, started in October).


**Symptoms:** August last year I started suffering from terrible night sweats—I'd wake up drenched through my clothes and sheets anywhere between 3 times a week to sometimes twice a night. Using a fan, lowering the room temp, cutting out caffeine, changing sleepwear and sheets etc didn't make any difference. 


In October I went to my GP to discuss some depression I was going through, including persistent fatigue that had started becoming so bad that I was struggling to stay awake while driving to work even after sleeping 11+ hours, and would still get home and immediately nap until dinner. 


December, I noticed a swollen cervical lymph node in the left side of my neck, about pea sized and rubbery/firm but movable. I wasn't ill and I've never had swollen nodes outside of when I was sick. Since then I've had more and more pop up—shotty lymph nodes in my neck, sort of clustered, a pea-sized one above my collarbone, multiple slightly larger ones in my groin, two in my armpit. All painless but none have gone away.


I went to the GP in January to get it checked out and he didn't seem concerned given they're all relatively small and movable (except for the shotty ones). Because I was having night sweats he ordered bloods, thyroid, kidney &amp; liver function tests which all came back totally normal. He said the sweats were ""probably caused by the sertraline"", which didn't really make sense to me, given I started it two months AFTER the night sweats began.


Last month I switched to a different GP and had another set of blood tests, again all normal. She did weigh me though and was concerned that I'd lost almost 10kg since my appointment in January, despite no diet changes. I've now been on a broad spectrum antibiotic for three weeks to see if an infection is causing my lymph nodes to swell but I haven't noticed any changes. But again... the lymph nodes are small and movable, so we appear to have stalled a bit in trying to find out what's going on. She said to come back if they got larger but no indication of whether we'd move to do chest x-rays or anything. Meanwhile I'm exhausted constantly and getting awful sleep because of the sweating.


Should I finish the 6 week antibiotic course before asking for more tests or just go back now and push to get some scans or a biopsy done?

For months I have been having multiple (what I think are) skipped beats a day. I counted the past two days and had 16 one day and 25 the other that I noticed while awake. I have definitely had days where there are more. They mostly happen minutes apart, but sometimes there will be 2 a minute.

I take my pulse with a heart rate app on my phone using the camera+flashlight. When the skipped beat is happening, instead of peaking like normal, the monitor sort of plateaus and then peaks. When it's happening, it feels like a /thump/ followed by a squeezing feeling of my heart, and then another /thump/. 

Is there a particular name for these? When I search palpitations, it seems to be defined by heart rate (which normally is between 60-100, even when the beats are happening).

508,AskDocs,"Hello! I (31F), underwent spinal fusion in May 2014 - fused with titanium rods and screws from T3 to L4. No issues except for occasional lower back (muscle) pain if I'm sat or stood for longer than usual, which is relieved by lying down/walking or a light massage to the muscles.

Anyway, I just got a smart scale ([this](https://us.eufy.com/products/t9149111) one in particular), and as I was reading the manual before first use, I read that **electronic** medical implants (like pacemakers and defibrillators) are contraindicated. It didn't note anything for non-electronic medical implants, but that got me worried - will using the device be safe for someone like me with non-electronic metal implants? I saw some contradictions in recommendations in my light online research but overall understand that having metal implants would skew the measurements for body fat percentage, among others. I have no issue with that, just with the safety of it all.

The title pretty much says it. For a couple years now I have been feeling tired constantly. It has only gotten worse. Although I do have a tendency to wake up a lot during the night, I usually don't have any issues falling back asleep. I am currently waiting to get tested if I have sleep apnea, because even though I sleep enough hours, I never feel like I've rested. So the doctors suspect I don't sleep deep enough.

However, the last few nights I've had so much trouble sleeping for unknown reasons. I just can't fall asleep at all. I don't know exactly when I felt asleep, but I was still awake at 3.40. And I woke up at 7. 

When I tell you... The energy I'm having right now is magical. I am literally almost tearing up, because I've felt tired for so long that I've forgotten what this feels like. But how? Why am I feeling like this when I haven't gotten any sleep?

Hello! 36F, normal BMI, non-drinker, smoker (trying to quit). I don't use any drugs.   
Not looking to get diagnosed; I've just been experiencing some weird stuff after starting my anticoagulation medicine and wanted to hear from Redditors. My next doctor's appointment is in May, and this isn't really urgent (at least I hope so), and I'll definitely raise these questions with them as well. 

**Some medical history:** 2 months ago, I had a small unprovoked pulmonary embolism. I recovered really well; I almost walked it off. 

I'm currently on anticoagulants Xarelto, 20mg. Since taking it, I've noticed quite an increase in spider veins in my entire body. I'm generally prone to them and had some on my legs forever (they run in the family). But now I started getting them all over, stomach, ribs, even toes. They're not super big or visible like the ones on my thighs -- but they weren't there before, and they're definitely spreading. They come in all colors, pink, red, and purple. Got some on my face, too, around the nose and in the mouth cavity, towards the back of the throat. 

No varicose veins anywhere and my PE wasn't caused by a leg DVT. 

And another fun change I've noticed is petechiae. Those little red dots that don't blanch when you press on them. I got some on my feet, around my ankles, one or two on my arms but most importantly, I got some on my lips and tongue. What the hell?

I'm generally very pale and always have visible veins, so I hope this is a Xarelto thing and will pass once my body adjusts. 

I can't say I'm not a tad worried, though. Bleeding under the skin is no fun and makes me wonder if this gives me a higher chance of internal bleeding. Interestingly enough, I haven't noticed an increase in bruising.

All my blood tests are fine. I did an autoimmune panel test, and everything came back negative. Did a vein check in my legs, too, and all good. I did a bunch of CTs and cancer checks, and I'm basically a very healthy individual. I still have to get tested for blood disorders (thrombophilia).   


Can anyone chime in with some insight? Googling didn't help - all I'm getting is Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, but I don't fit the bill.  
I'm just worried I'll be completely red and purple if the veins keep spreading and growing like this. And I might be on anticoagulants for life, so...

Hello!

I am a man, 31 yo.

During the last couple of months feeling not well. I have a thirst, frequent urinating (mild, \~3 liters per day), headaches sometimes, and reflux.

Total calcium: 2.62 mmol/L or 10.5 mg/dl

Ionized calcium: 1.38 mmol/L or 5.53 mg/dl

Albumin: 48.64 g/L

PTH: 49.9 pg/ml or 5.29 pmol/l

Vitamin D (25): 13.17 ng/ml or 32.87 nmol/l

Ultrasound shows a slight enlargement of the thyroid gland and a large number of small concrements (2-3 mm) in both kidneys. Thyroid hormone levels are ok.

Endocrinologist told me that I cannot have HPT since my PTH level is in normal ranges. I was prescribed iodine and vitamin D. Diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus are ruled out.

As far as I know, \~20% of all HPT cases may be with normal PTH ranges..

Should I seek another doctor, who would have a better understanding of HPT?

Issue: difficult breathing, shortness of breath associated with coughing, wheezing, and crackling in lungs. I've been experiencing this for over a year now since my recovery of covid. Never had issues breathing, never had asthma, and never had allergies. My symptoms have become worse this past 2 months. I wake up gasping for air. I also have phlegm, but that's nothing new. I've had this since I was 13 or 14 years old it's just been worse after covid. About an hour ago, I believe I had a flare-up or something. I was fine then the next minute I was coughing profusely and wheezing with cracking sounds, my right chest and lung felt like it was burning and now my skin (right chest) is hot and sensitive to the touch. I stopped coughing after about 7 minutes. After that, I began breathing through my nose and heard a  whistling sound. I felt like I couldn't breathe, especially from my right lung.

So as of recent i've found myself physically unable to stretch (specifically my legs) with out ending up in temporary excruciating pain.
Any time I go to stretch my legs after being stagnant for too long it's almost as if I'm stretching them too far and my leg just slowly hurts more and more until I'm in horrible pain which lasts for around a minute however I can still feel leftover pain in my leg for up to 3 days afterwards. I can't figure out what is causing this the best thing I've seen is that I'm dehydrated which is definitely not the case considering I drink a very large abundance of water daily. For the meantime I've resorted to attempting to stretch my thighs as a substitute however it is extremely unsatisfying and annoying especially when almost all the time I almost accidentally stretch my calf and have a jumpscare thinking I did it again.

please let me know if you need more history, i understand i have complex medical issues

current issue:
in around august 2022 i started experiencing very frequent sleep paralysis. i’ve dealt with it in the past but very seldomly; maybe 3 times a year. in the past, it presented normally. i’d wake up unable to move until i could wiggle a toe or finger and then a little more until i could move my body. it’s always freaked me out, but i’ve been grateful i’ve never seen a “sleep paralysis demon” or anything like that. i’d never hallucinated in my life.

the sleep paralysis in aug ‘22 was different. it suddenly started happening 2-3 a week and i had two new symptoms at first. my whole head sort of tingled or buzzed, it’s hard to explain, during it, and i also felt drugged. in the past, my mind was completely awake but my body was not. with this, it’s like waking up but then feeling like i’d been hit with a blow dart of sedatives or something. i saw my pcp and she sent a referral for a sleep study. while waiting for that (spoiler: i haven’t had it) i have developed an added symptom that is very scary to me.

i began hallucinating while during them. but never like what you hear others describe. it’d be my husband talking to me or my kids laughing or worse, screaming, and once i could move and look, i’d see it wasn’t real. i talked to my psych doc about this and he said it was highly unlikely to be psych related and to keep following up with my doctor. then we moved across the state. it wasn’t until after we moved that i finally heard from the sleep clinic, so that didn’t work out.

in the past couple months, the hallucinations (they are all auditory) have gotten so much worse but the sleep paralysis is less severe or not even there sometimes. it’s basically every time i’m falling asleep or waking up, i hear things i know aren’t there, sometimes creepy and sometimes just annoying, like my phone alarm going off. it could be happening more frequently because i’m also experiencing *extreme* fatigue, so i’m taking at least one if not two naps a day. 

i also have a headache every day, which as a migraine sufferer isn’t something that is hugely concerning. but they didn’t used to be every single day, and they are mostly just around my right eye and sometimes the base of the skull rather than the entire half of my head, so it is a different headache to my migraines, though i still do get those.

because we recently moved to a new area and have struggled with health insurance, i haven’t gotten a new doctor. i have an appointment with a new pcp in june. last week i got freaked out because i experienced extreme vertigo and the hearing in my right ear became *very* muffled (it since has been going in and out) and went to urgent care. the doctor seemed annoyed i was there for something not necessarily urgent and too complex, which fair, but i’ve been and was really scared. he thought at first maybe it was a side effect of one of my meds which is why i included how long i’ve been on them here. he did a basic blood test though but there was nothing too concerning i don’t think, just from checking myself on the mychart and by the fact they didn’t call. my wbc was a little high and the absolute neutrophils and absolute eosinophils (don’t even know what those are) and my co2 was low, but idk what any of the means. again, since they didn’t call i’m guessing it’s fine. oh and he did the flashlight in the eyes thing and said it looked fine and i didn’t need a head ct.

i have some other random symptoms, like forgetting basic words/mixing words together and bumping into shit all the time. these also started in the past couple months.

does anyone have any clue what the heck could be going on? i live in the middle of nowhere and it could move at a snail’s pace getting in with doctors that can actually help me. i’m also worried they won’t take the hallucinations seriously because i have bipolar disorder but i was dx at 17, 13yrs ago and have never hallucinated before. and my amazing psychiatrist really feels this is not psych related. also fyi i’ve never used lsd or anything if that matters.

I am a male suffering from anemia since a kid. By this I mean by body is not absorbing iron. My ferritin is at 8 and I’ve only ever females talking about those levels at that range due to menstruation. I do not menstruate however so there has to be something wrong with me and I don’t know what it is. 

I already eat a very iron rich diet and have tried iron supplements as well. Please don’t tell me to try a new supplement because this is something wrong with my iron absorption and I need to know what it is.

My mean cell volume is low at 75-77fL, but all other blood count is normal (hemoglobin is fine as well at 142 g/L). My ferritin is at 8 ug/L. This is dangerously low and has no reason being this low, I eat red meat religiously.

I’m not asking to be diagnosed completely but I want to know what are my possibilities? Do I have a GI bleed? Celiacs disease? Some sort of cancer? 

If I do have the possibility to have a GI bleed, does this mean I’ve had it since a kid? Is it even possible to have a GI bleed for that long? 

Other symptoms: diarrhea sometimes, upset stomach sometimes and seborrhoea dermatitis since I was a kid

I had a dance teacher SIT on my back as an attempt to “stretch” me in 2018. I’ve had other teachers do this before with no problem, but she was the first to put her whole body weight on me. I remember screaming in pain but also simultaneously “laughing it off” because I didn’t want to ruin the vibe of the class.

Ever since then, there’s been a sharp pain at my lower back, right in the middle where my spine is every time I bend backwards past a certain point. I was young when it happened so I was too afraid to speak up but now that I’m older I’m (1) really fucking mad that a professional dance instructor didn’t know better and (2) worried that I’ve had an actual injury this whole time without even knowing. 

The pain was bad, but once I started working out it seemed to mostly go away on its own. I still work out, and it’s back again. I’m worried. I don’t know if something is SEVERELY wrong , as I’m able to perform regular movement just fine, but something is definitely not right.

This went on and I noticed it started to happen unconsciously. I tried to stop but it still happens occasionally, especially if I am high on weed. I avoid smoking now.
  
More recently I have started verbalizing when those deeply uncomfortable thoughts happen. The thoughts are shameful moments of the past that I have never dealt with. It's like how you say fuck after stubing a toe. Except now it happens automatically.

The tic is saying an awful word (will not share which) 3 times. 
  
This isn't tourettes right? How would I go about seeking resources to find the underlying cause so this doesn't turn into some full blown issue?

I've never been diagnosed with a mental disorder nor have I sought a diagnosis.

It may be relevant but I have always had intrusive thoughts. For example, my first I had as a child was an image of a something that started normal and would decay. It would go back to normal and then decay. This would repeat many times as a loop.

A little back story, my dad died 2 years ago [49M | 5’10 | around 200lbs maybe?]. He had been dealing with some really weird pains for a few years. He said his toes always felt like they were thawing out, and they would hurt so bad he would literally cry (he does not cry, I’ve seen him almost bleed out and he didn’t shed a single tear). He would often take off his socks and shoes and squeeze his toes in his hands to try to relieve some of the pain I assume. He went to doctors all the time but they could never tell him what the problem was. They would just prescribe him a ton of pain killers because there was nothing they could do…
Those very pain killers caused his heart to slow down in his sleep, until it stopped beating.
My dad was a very good man and an even better father and friend. He was so relaxed and I love him so much. He was alone when he died and his friend found him ~3 days later. He was laying on his side for 3 days so it was a closed casket funeral. Maybe me not having closure is the reason I still even think about this…

593,AskDocs,"21M, no recent diagnoses/ not on any meds, asking for help because I wont have access to a doctor for a while.

3 days ago I travelled back and forth (to a convention then to across london and back) a lot and played volleyball (intensely) for 2 hours. That night I felt v fatigued and developed chills (generally felt cold even though my SO said the room was as warm as it usually was)

That night I had a fever dream and tossed and turned a crazy amount, adjusting my sleeping position a ton and put my head and neck in some uncomfortable position. Barely slept that night and time felt really slow.

The next day I developed a bilateral tension headache with (bilateral) neck strain (that feels like the kind of neck strain you get when you look at your phone too long). The neck strain ran all the way from just above my traps to around the area of my temporal bone. I also generally felt cold and developed a fever. Slept ok that night (8h).

The next day (yesterday), my headache and neck strain persisted but my neck started to hurt unilaterally (left), while my headache remained bilateral on the side of my forehead. Only my upper neck hurt, especially when I got up from lying down, or whenever I touched (w light pressure) behind my head (temporal bone area/ that fleshy bit). It also hurt whenever I turned my head far right and far left even.

Woke up after 1 hour of sleep to get ready to travel to the airport today and the neck pain and headache are still there.

The best way I can describe this pain is like the pain of whiplash but milder and when touching the area that hurts, the pain persists for as long as I make contact with that spot. It also hurts when I get my blood pumping eg when walking fast or going up the stairs.

Was at work lifting the lift gate on a large truck(2-300lbs). Felt an awkward feeling in my spine, almost a numbing feeling like someone pushing a cold thumb hard against my lower spine. Kinda walked it off for about 10 or 15 minutes, went to pick up an empty plastic bag off the ground and my back just gave out and I fell over. 

Went to the doctor, just tried to see if I could move, wrote a script for ibuprofen and told me to stay home from work for 10 days. 

I'm in excruciating pain, like I've broken about 8 bones in my life and none of them even compared to this. Took me 8 minutes to put on pants today(I timed it), can't sit at all, can only lay or stand. Coughed getting out of the car at the doctor and it hurt so bad i actually fell out of my car onto the ground. They gave me some shot in my butt that was supposed to help with the pain and it maybe took it from a 9 to an 8. 

My question is, at what point do I go seek more medical advice from my own personal doctor and not the workman's comp doctor. They gave me an Xray, but I'm not unfamiliar to back injuries, I know am MRI is probably needed. Is there any harm in waiting the full 10 days for a follow up? No Idea what to do, never felt pain this bad.

I (20M) got off a flight a few hours ago and in the past hour I noticed my knee was hurting a little and now my whole leg has been aching sort of like a growing pain I would have when I was younger.

Now I'm really anxious about the possibility of a blood clot. I don't notice any swelling or redness compared to the left leg, and they are the same temperature as far as I can tell. 

My right leg feels warm (not when I touch it, i just feel hot down there) and it is sort of cramping. It's kind of like that blood rush sensation you get when you move a muscle that wasn't getting good circulation, except that it doesn't really let up and there's no way to relieve it. The pain at tines extends into my calf but not much. 

Are these sorts of pains normal? I have been a lot less active the past month after hitting my head (which started all my health anxiety to begin with) and so I want to believe it's all muscle strain but I can't stop thinking it's a blood clot

I do know that some of my other muscles have been out of whack throughout this whole ordeal. Back aches, hip/groin pain

It's been on and off for about an hour. It hurts a little when I walk but only in my knee, almost like I bent my knee wrong or something.

They transferred my call to UC who said that they wouldn’t do a physical exam on it and to get an ultrasound immediately and to go to the ER. I’ve been pretty overwhelmed by it all. I feel like the ER is a bit excessive, and I don’t know whether to go to UC for a physical exam first or to just go straight there.

The obvious reason is that they can’t rule out cancer, but would UC be able to at least confirm or deny if the lump is suspicious before going to the ER? I don’t know how to go about this because it’s been weighing down on my mind.

I've had sex once with my bf 2 months ago. The day after, I got pain in my upper sides. And light fever every day for a week. I went to the hospital and did some tests. They said I had an infection in my urine and gave me antibiotics.

When I finished the antibiotics, the fever and the infection went away. But then, 5-6 days later, they always come back. I've been to the hospital many times and done even more tests. But they say there's nothing wrong with my blood, or organs. Only the UTI is the cause of the fever. They would only prescribe more types of antibiotics for me and told me to drink more water (which I did). But the UTI with the fever always comes back.

My body is really tired from all the pills. It messed up my pH balance, my periods, and gave me other vaginal infections. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I've stopped sex completely 2 months ago. And will try Reiki healing this weekend but I'm so scared that the UTI wouldn't be treated for good.

613,AskDocs,"Good evening everyone, I am a (27/M/300lbs) and I have a few questions that’s been bugging me for a few days now. In February I had a fall while at a customers home and I landed on my wrist. Immediately I felt like my wrist was unstable and would often go numb. I reported it to my supervisor and got the process started for a work comp claim. Went through the processes and attempted to treat conservatively (brace, nsaids etc) I was referred to a hand surgeon where he suggested I undergo an arthrogram to check everything. 

The MRI showed this: Extravasation of contrast from the radiocarpal to the distal radial ulnar joint consistent with an abnormality of the triangular fibrocartilage complex. There is a probable tiny partial tear of the central disc as above. The peripheral substance appears intact.
The volar located meniscal homolog is probably partially torn as well.

Fast forward. We have surgery last week and the doctor said that they debrided the area and performed a neurectomy on the introssesous nerve to relieve the pain. He also noted that when they put the scopes in that the tear was very clear and could immediately see it. If they did all of that why wouldn’t they just tighten up the ligament to where my wrist isn’t completely unstable anymore?

Negative for all hepatitis.

They did extensive testing for dementia and similar disorders but found nothing. She’s a smart and clear headed person - up until a week ago. She’s had no apparent memory loss or any other unusual changes before this. 

Her doctor suspected a uti again and put her on antibiotics but the hallucinations were so extreme that she’s now admitted into a hospital (regular not psychiatric). She believes her neighbor is going to kill her and implanted cameras in her and that’s why she can hear her no matter where she is. She’s suffering terribly in the hospital and is incredibly anxious calling me every hour to see if I’m ok (she thinks they may hurt me as well) as well as friends telling them she is dying (I have followed up with everyone). 

The uti did come back with suspected bacteria but the doctor is mystified at her behaviors as he said they are quite extreme for a uti but that there is no clear diagnosis otherwise. He isn’t sure what might be happening yet. 

I’m so worried about her going home and this continuing. She was knocking on her neighbors door the night before we brought her to the hospital and even called the police and the director of the place she lives (55+ community) was extremely angry over it.

So I went on a trip to the DR last June and when I came back I had massive diarrhea which I hear can happen. It took almost a month for me to get back to normal but I did notice my stools never seemed to form back to regular. They seemed to always be changing in how they looked and they seemed to be soft or just break apart due to being so soft. 

Fast forward to last month I started looking up symptoms of colon cancer and it made me hyper focus on my stool and my body to where it has been giving me insane anxiety and stress which in return does not help my gut.

The symptoms I've been having is obviously the stool always being different (you can check post for photos)
Abdominal pain around my right ribs that radiates to the left, to the sternum, to lower middle. Usually dull or sharp and last a few seconds but can happen all day esp if I think about it..if I don't it actually tends to go away.

But for the past few days I've been very nauseous after I eat..it seems the food just sits and I can't throw up..if I do its just acidic and when I finally am able, it's just all the food I had the day before. This has also given me pains in my gut, mainly middle sternem area but still the random pains on my right and left side. I also pretty much shit exactly what I ate. 

Is this something that sounds like complications from colon cancer or something gi related that is less serious? What's wild is the nausea started Thursday and by Saturday I felt ok and yesterday even went to the gym with no issues..today it started AGAIN.",t2_cbl4scec,0,What is wrong with me?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12q8zva,True,Mrcsbud2,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12q8zva/what_is_wrong_with_me/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12q8zva/what_is_wrong_with_me/,475597,1681789089,0,,False,1681789103,1681789103,2023-04-18 03:38:09,,,

I was diagnosed with Haital hernia 2 years ago, I used PPis for a few months and I stopped having heartburn/ chest pain. Recently I started having these exact chest pains again. I started PPIs again. For the past 3 months, When i wake up i spit yellow saliva. And the longer i sleep the darker the color. Sometimes dark brown, most likely blood. My teeth also hurts, i feel them pulse when i wake up, as if there was pressure on them. The longer I sleep the more pressure i feel on my teeth. I also stopped sleeping on my side and started sleeping on my back 3 months ago (due to arm/neck pain). I did go to the dentist and she told me after cleaning your gums will be better. Also to add when all of this started 3 months ago, i started to go to to pee at night more frequently specially if i drink more water, but when i lay down i tend to feel the urge to pee much more faster than before. I may end up going to pee 3 times in the course of a 6 hour sleep, but peeing in the morning is normal and not as frequent.

Over the past year, I’ve developed this nasty predicament where, when I lay down in bed at night, a small spot or two on my feet will start to itch. I tend to scratch them absentmindedly, but this will cause the itch to intensify and spread from the initial site. Oftentimes, this results in both my feet having a burning itching sensation that only calms down if I can muster the willpower to avoid touching them for over thirty minutes, or if I soak them in cool to room temperature water for about 10-15 minutes. 

There’s some slight redness that accompanies this issue, but no lesions, rash, or sores. I’ve no apparent fungal infection. The starting spot of the itch tends to be random, though most often it will start on top of one of my toes,or the side of my arch. 

As a suspected result of the diabetes, as well as being on my feet all day most days, there’s is a little dryness on top of my toes (and brittle toenails, but that may be a symptom for another day). There’s also some dryness and callused skin in the back/bottom of my heels.

I went to an ENT about 8 months ago because I have dealt with a congested feeling in my sinuses for years. I had a sinus CT scan ordered and the results came back and showed no issues. Because of this and the fact that I mentioned I had a history of teeth grinding in my sleep my ENT diagnosed me with TMJ and gave me naproxen and tizandine. 

But, he also mentioned that he found something in the “back of my head” that “most people do not have.” But other than that he did not make a big deal out of it and left me with my TMJ diagnosis. 

He also gave me a referral to a neurologist but I never set up an appointment because the medication did initially ease my sinus pressure symptoms. But over the past few months I’ve had what I can only describe as a dull headache in the back of my head right above my neck. 

With this I went back to look at my CT scan results and noticed in the notes of my referral that the doctor mentioned a “MENINGIOMA RIGHT SIDE” in the description. 

Ever since seeing this I have begun wondering if this is the cause of my symptoms. I’ve also begun to experience other symptoms since seeing this diagnosis and want to know what my next steps should be to get this checked out. 

Also, what are other common symptoms of a Meningioma in the back of the head on the right side?",t2_8877ofet,0,Meningioma found during sinus CT scan.

Less than a week ago, I stood up out of bed and immediately felt a lot of discharge come out, similar to feeling a heavy period. (In hindsight, I can’t be sure if it came out of my vagina or anus.) 

When I checked in the bathroom it was bright yellow and very wet. It did not smell like my normal discharge and was in fact largely odorless. It was very scary to see this but I haven’t had anything similar since - my discharge has been mostly normal.

My period ended more than a week before this happened. I had been engaging in fairly regular condomless sex around this time. I also wasn’t eating particularly well (skipping meals, unhealthy food etc).

I'm going to try &amp; keep this as short/quick to the point as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started the BC pill when I was 14 due to extremely bad periods (debilitating cramps, nausea, hot flashes, etc.) The doctor did a sonogram but she didn't do a pelvic ultrasound because I was only 14. She didn't see anything out of the norm, so she put me on the pill.

I've been on the pill since I was 14 &amp; I recently got off of it this past February because I wanted to let my body run it's natural course &amp; I didn't want to be putting hormones etc. into my body. So, my periods without taking birth control (March &amp; April) were really bad. Hot flashes, debilitating cramps where I can't function, back pain, nausea/vomiting, basically everything you could think of. I know I did this to myself but I just wanted to be done taking any form of birth control. This past cycle in April, I thought about the possibility of having endometriosis or an underlying condition. The research I have done told me that my period symptoms weren't the norm. 

I made an appointment with my gyno and when I went, my gyno told me that my symptoms are completely normal and the only way to solve it is to take Motrin or BC. Motrin doesn't work for my period symptoms. I told her I don't want to go back on BC and how I want to do a pelvic ultrasound. They got me into the earliest appointment for a pelvic ultrasound.

My gyno called me once she got the results of my pelvic ultrasound and said that everything is normal (no fibroids, cysts, or polyps). She said that I should go back on BC to relieve my symptoms. 

Should I make an appointment with an endometriosis specialist? I'm just confused because I have these debilitating period symptoms and I find it hard to believe that this is ""normal"" and there is nothing underlying. I don't like how my gyno is pushing BC so hard even though I told her I am not comfortable taking it anymore. I really would just like opinions from those who have experience with endometriosis.

TL;DR
Liver cyst with single septation grew from 2cm to 6.4cm since 2017

I have a liver cyst that first appeared around 2012. I know it was not there prior to this because it was not there during my sonographer schooling. I first noticed it when scanning myself (I know, I know) but didn’t think much of it because of how common and benign liver cysts are. It was between 1-2cm then, with a thin septation, in the caudate lobe. 

In 2017 the cyst was incidentally seen on a CT I had when I had a kidney stone. It was 2cm. Every now and then I have a peak at it. In the last few years it has started to get bigger. I had an official ultrasound this week. It is now 6.4cm, still with a single septation. 

Generally I’m not worried about liver cysts, but I don’t like that it’s growing. I’ll obviously follow up with my doctor, but what are the guidelines/recommendations here? How would I know if it’s a cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma?

Hi everyone! I am a 22 year old female, 5’11 and 73.2kg. I am only on thyroxine (+ vitamins).

Hi everyone, last Wednesday I suffered a pretty nasty pneumothorax making it my third time. I had one at 17 which required surgery, second last year in august which didn't need surgery, and this third one which needed a chemical pleurodesis at basically 30. I finally got home on Sunday and have been having the fight of my life with exhaustion. I decided to look at my discharge papers and it mentioned that there is pulmonary vascular congestion and it is seriously freaking me out. My surgeon is pretty amazing and is a cardio and lung doctor, probably the best in the state and he didn't mention it, but I wish he said something because this has me really scared that my heart is failing.

Taking Tramadol, Ativan and cyclobenzaprine as needed. 

So over the last 2 weeks I’ve woken up to feeling of throwing up in my sleep. The first time I just had the feeling and it woke me up in middle of the night. The second time I actually had the vomit in my mouth when I woke up and I began choking on it. The other day was the 3rd time this happens but it was just feeling of being unable to breathe as if I was about to choke. I jumped out of bed and it took a good 3-5 seconds to feel able to breathe again. 

Now what I can say is a few weeks ago I got traumatic news that makes me need ativan. I take the other two beds because I have a herniated disc that’s very painful and won’t go away.

Apologies for the long post, I just need some help.

Saw a dr (not my usual as mine is on leave) last week to refill effexor prescription. I had already missed one dose at the time of appt as I had misplaced my medication and did not have a script, and was already experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The doctor decided he didn’t like the combination of medications above that I had been taking for 2+ years, and wanted to try me on something that could “kill 2 birds with one stone” instead of giving my usual script. I agreed to try it since I didn’t want to take anything together which could be harmful. I was then prescribed amytriptiline. 
The doctor instructed me to just begin the new medication right away since I was already experiencing the withdrawal symptoms of Effexor, so cold Turkey off that. In hindsight this seems like not the greatest idea, but I trusted his judgement. 
A week later and the withdrawal symptoms are ongoing, mostly which I have experienced before. I feel strange in my body, and like I’m in a dream almost. It’s unpleasant. I also had awful, vivid nightmares which I’d describe on the first night as feeling like hallucinations I couldn’t break from, but it’s since improved. 
The worst part though is my mental state. I have zero emotional resilience or control at the moment, am in tears and feeling depressed constantly, no matter what I’m doing, and irritated easily. My self esteem has tanked even more than it was prior, I feel worthless and can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror. I’m really struggling and don’t know if it was a mistake to mess with my medication.

Passed out back in august, had symptoms that line up with Pots. Echo and holter came back negative. I just wanted a second opinion on the results of my tilt table test results below: 

Interpretation Summarv
• Baseline ECG showed sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia.
• At 20 minutes the patient was given 400 mcg sublingual (SL) nitroglycerine.
• Tilt-table test is positive for vasodepressor type neurocardiogenic syncope.
Tilt Table
INFORMED CONSENT: The nature of the procedure, along with its expected benefits, alternatives and possible complications were discussed candidly with the patient. The patient is willing to have the procedure done.
TECHNIQUE: After obtaining informed consent the patient was placed on the tilting table and an intravenous line was started. The patient was secured to the table with the use of wide straps and attached to an ECG machine. The tilting table was then elevated to the 80 head-up position. At 20 minutes the patient was given 400 mcg sublingual (SL) nitroglycerine. The patient reported symptoms during the procedure. The patient was tilted for 25 minutes. The test was stopped because of syncope.
FINDINGS:
BASELINE: sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia. The heart rate is 103 bpm. The blood pressure at baseline is 118/80
mmha.
PASSIVE TILT-TABLE TESTING: During passive tilt-table testing at 80 degrees in the absence of pharmacological provocation the patient's heart rate ranged between 114 and 150 bpm and the blood pressure ranged between 121/84 and 125/89 mg. The patient experienced nausea and spots in eyes.
TILT-TABLE TESTING AFTER PROVOCATION WITH NITROGLYCERINE: After administration of sublingual nitroglycerine the patient's heart rate ranged between 150 and 173 bpm and the blood pressure ranged between 81/46 and 134/77 mmH. The patient experienced syncope and nausea.
CONCLUSION:
Tilt-table test is positive for vasodepressor type neurocardiogenic syncope.

712,AskDocs,"Tl;dr: I know taking MMF can cause anaemia, but can *withdrawing* from MMF cause anaemia? 


I've been on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, a.k.a. cellcept) for about 7 years now - I take 2x 1g daily to suppress an autoimmune condition. I've also been borderline anaemic for as long as I can remember (some iron, mostly B12 and B9 due to lifelong absorption issues), but it's typically stable as I take prescription supplements/injections that bypass said issue, and my bloods are monitored at least once a month.  

I know that taking MMF can cause anaemia in rare cases. But I've never once had that issue specifically from being on MMF - not when I first started taking it, nor thereafter when I've taken a constant dose every day. 

The problem is when I try to stop taking MMF. The first time, I was taken off my entire dose all in one go. The second time I tapered my whole dose over two weeks (which I now appreciate is a very short timescale, but my hospital consultant at the time did not know much as it turns out, since he also thought you could just stop steroids cold turkey...yay adrenal crisis). The third time I tried just cutting out a quarter of my dose, i.e. 1x 500mg tablet. 

Every time I've had sudden and severe anaemia. The first two times, within a week or two I needed emergency admittance to hospital and blood infusions to stabilise. The third time after a little while, my GP saw my blood results starting to drop again and just called off the taper before I ended up in EAU a third time. My GP and are both very research-minded (he's a professional of course, mine is just a personal interest for now as my degree is in applied maths with some bio crossover), but the only possible explanation we ever really came up with is anaemia from sudden chronic disease inflammation. This has never really satisfied me as an answer though, as I didn't experience the other symptoms and blood results that I usually do when I have a flare up.  

So is ACD the most likely explanation here, or is there something else I've missed? Feel free to send papers/other references if you have them. I'm partly motivated by the fact that I'm in a position to try tapering again with respect to my autoimmune condition (any taper will be attempted safely under my GP's supervision). 

Thanks to anyone who read all the way through!

The problem is, it has been a month and my pain is worse. My kneecap goes numb at times, then when I stand up, it snaps back into place. The sound is extremely loud and very very painful. I also have a hard lump and swelling on the inside of my knee that pushes against my other leg.

I’ve noticed a couple of times lately my son’s stool smells sweet. It’s a weird smell - it definitely is a foul smell (like, it’s stool for sure) but also just… sweet. Like fruity candy. It’s not every time. It’s with perfectly normal bowel movements (not loose, etc.) I know sweet smelling urine or breath can be indicators of diabetes, and wasn’t sure if this was also the case with stool and if it warranted a check in with his doctor. He doesn’t seem to show any other suggested symptoms - not excessively hungry or thirsty as far as I can tell (he’s four and he’s a black hole, but so is his 6yo sister and his dad - they’re grazers). His weight and energy and mood have been consistent and normal (I would say he is neither over nor under weight — he’s big for his age but very proportional and pure muscle) He occasionally has bedwetting episodes but it’s almost always when he’s had a big drink before bed, which seems to me pretty explicable for a four year old still (he actually just had one this evening — he’d gone and drank his whole cup of water, probably about 12oz right before bed. He usually will just have a few sips). We eat a varied diet that i would say is moderately healthy, but of course he’s also 4 - he doesn’t love vegetables, and we enjoy small sweet treats in moderation. 

He’s due for a checkup in July and wasn’t sure if the random fruity stool was worth a sooner appointment, and don’t want to freak my husband out for no reason just because I noticed some odd smelling poo a couple of times.",t2_3ggwt1yp,0,Sweet smelling stool? - child,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,nsfw,False,default,[],{},,True,text,3,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,True,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12q5tvt,True,februarytide-,,1,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12q5tvt/sweet_smelling_stool_child/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12q5tvt/sweet_smelling_stool_child/,475586,1681782603,0,,False,1681782620,1681782621,2023-04-18 01:50:03,,,

I've been losing weight since late September when I started at 275 pounds, averaging just under a pound of loss per week. I shoot for a 500 cal/day deficit, which amounts to 1800ish calories per day. All that to say, not a particularly agressive rate of loss.

I eat a diet that feels fairly normal and balanced to me, no major food groups cut out, and I have some kind of veggies every day. However, for the past few months especially, maybe since January, I've been feeling exceptionally sleepy. Average about 7 hours of sleep a night, like I have my whole adult life, yet I'm finding myself drinking more and more coffee just to get through the day.

No other symptoms, no major weakness or anything. Just so freaking tired all the time. I'm wondering if this could be an iron deficiency? I do have a doc appt. for June (the soonest I could get), but if it's as simple as trying an iron supplement, I'd love to do that instead of living like this for two more months.

729,AskDocs,"First time posting here, apologies for any mistakes of misspellings. 

Some background: I am 27f with no serious medical problems. 6-8 months ago I started feeling that swallowing a pill got a little more tricky. I used to be able to take pills dry without following up with water. Now I have to have water in my mouth and be a bit more mindful when swallowing to make sure it doesn’t get stuck in my throat. I smoked cigarettes for maybe 3 years when I was younger, and definitely used electronic vapes off and on for another 3/4 years. I am a cannabis user also. 

I went to my PCP a couple of weeks ago because of an inner ear infection, while at the appt I mentioned my difficulties swallowing, so she gave me antibiotics and referred me to an ENT for the swallowing difficulties. 

I went to the ENT on Saturday where the Dr. placed a scope up my nose and down my throat. He said he saw an abnormal “ridge” at the back of my throat, about the width of his pinky finger. He mentioned he wanted me to get a CT and follow up a head and neck specialist for the mass. I also had “cobblestone throat” and definite signs of allergies. After getting my referral paper I noticed that it was for a head/neck oncologist. I asked about cancer and he said he just wants to be sure with my family history (my dad passed recently from colon cancer, my aunt is in remission for throat/Laryngeal cancer) . I asked if the “mass” I have looks like cancer to him, he said the placement is odd and not what he sees with cancer usually as cancer usually appears in different sections that are both higher and lower.

This was absolutely devastating for me to hear. I was my dads caregiver through the his end of life. He passed away only ~45 days after his dx and it was so brutal. I have a 9 year old and am finally feeling like I’m at a point in life where I feel good about my career and future, this makes me so sad to even have to deal with. I want to deal with normal issues like work stress or my car breaking down, not real potential end of life stress. :( The past couple days were HARD. I spent most of the time sobbing and crying hysterically. I went to a psych care center today and they were very helpful and were able to prescribe me a couple of medications to get me through the panic (that’s the only reason I’m even able to type this).

Scheduling all of these tests and follow ups have been a nightmare. I had a CT scheduled for Wednesday but got a call that the office I was referred to is out of network, so I’ll need to wait at least another week. 

Am I overreacting? Or do all signs point to cancer? Not looking for a diagnosis here but would love some perspective or hear other experiences. I have a work trip next week (long flight) that I am thinking of cancelling, but I’ve been really looking forward to it and don’t know if it’s worth cancelling. It’s hard talking to family members because they are either emotional about it (understandably) or just say “don’t worry you’ll be fine”, which isn’t super comforting.

731,AskDocs,"In 2006 I was diagnosed with GERD by Navy doctors. I was given generic Prilosec which never seemed to work. It grew worse and worse with bouts of nausea and vomiting coming and going. I got out of the Navy in 2007 and carried on treatment with the VA with a service related disability given for the GERD. In 2013, I underwent an endoscopy due to continued vomiting spells resuming in weight loss. It was then that they found and H. Pylori infection. I believe this infection went undiagnosed for 6+ years as I waited almost a year before seeking treatment for my heartburn. 

I was given the antibiotics and such to get rid of the infection and my latest stool sample was negative in 2018. However, I continue to have terrible heartburn, even with medication. Not as much nausea or vomiting since treatment. I recall that after the endoscopy they told me that the ulceration in my esophagus was substantial. I have not had another endoscopy since then. However, I have been diagnosed with IBS since then as well. I have seen several studies during my research into my claims that point to as high as a 66% correlation between the two conditions. 

When attempting to file claims for the duodenal ulcers and IBS secondary to the GERD/infection they continue to deny them as related to each other and therefore not service related. My research also points out that I am at a higher risk of developing GI cancers due to these conditions. My rating is already pretty high and the addition of these conditions would not change things for me, however I want to be able to prove to the VA that these things are related because I believe they are. 

Ultimately my intent is to make sure that if I’m ever diagnosed with some type of GI cancer the opportunity for treatment through the VA exist.

It started as a round bump, but has spread to the surrounding area and almost resembles heart shape in the image below. I'm in my own head about this and have begun to freak out a little because of its longevity and overall spread.

About a week ago, after sitting on the toilet for a while and trying to force the stool out, suddenly my anus hurt very weirdly. The pain was so weird that I stood up and waited for a few minutes until I sat again. This one concerned me but I thought maybe it was some kind of a muscle cramp so did not pay much attention after. Then starting about 3,4 days ago, I've started to have constipated dehydrated stool ( because of poor diet probably lately). I noticed that while wiping, sometimes when i wiped a specific point of the anus, I was feeling a weird pain that would probably be felt up to the lower right part of my stomach, but not always, so I didnt pay much attention thinking that it was something with the nerves which would fade later. Then 3 days ago, I ve been noticing that while wiping, the toilet paper would become a little wet, but i thought it was just because of sweating. Now today, I've had one of the most dehydrated stools I ever had and after I was done, while wiping I noticed a yellow sticky substance on the paper. This set off my alarms. Turns out this is anal discharge.

As for possible reasons, I was thinking maybe first due to poor diet lately which I am going to improve after today. But also, I was thinking that it could be an infection due to a poseidon's kiss I got while sitting on a dirty public toilet. Or maybe there was an anal fissure due to dehydrated stool. I forgot to mention that occasionally I notice a very light reddish hue next to the stool but I could never decide if it is due to the food or due to blood. I can't think of other reasons.

TLDR: Going to a lung specialist tomorrow, want my concerns taken seriously.

I went to a GP last month because I was noticing I felt short of breath frequently, tired, and generally worn down. Also my wife said only seeing a doctor once every 15 years was probably too long. I work in construction and I'm fairly active. I'm put on a few pounds since having a child, but I still average over 15,000 steps and 3,500 calories burned per day. I have never had trouble having the energy to go all day, until a few months ago. Our toddler was going through a sleep regression last fall so I found myself tired more often. Then I noticed I was getting gassed just doing things I've done many times. Two trips up the stairs on the job would leave me breathing heavier than normal. Helping carry some cabinets upstairs left me panting where I couldn't talk. Then I started to notice I was still tired despite the toddler getting back to normal sleeping. Long story short, after a lifetime of physical work, this was different than anything I had felt before. 

  So I go to the GP and I briefly described my symptoms at check-in and they grabbed a questionnaire about anxiety to make me fill out. After going back to a room the nurse asked me to describe the reason for my visit and again grabs a worksheet about anxiety and starts questioning me on that, ignoring other avenues. When the doctor finally arrived he took a similar path before I finally stopped him and assured him I was not anxious. He recommended routine blood work and an optional referral to a lung and sleep specialist. The blood work came back fine aside from cholesterol being a little above normal. 

This brings me to the present. My appointment with the lung specialist is tomorrow and I would like to know what I should ask or how I should approach this to have my concerns taken seriously. I'm aware that doctors are probably constantly annoyed by patients who come in with their own hypotheses and ""research"", and turn off when presented with that. I'm also aware that I can come off as a country bumpkin because of my accent. I watched my father struggle to be taken seriously in his medical experiences and receive stupid boilerplate solutions because of his demeanor.

I’ve had previous septoplasty, turbinate reduction, and concha excision (bilateral) Nov. 2022, and had a nasal swab done in March that revealed growth of S. Aureus in both sinuses 

Just had, 4/12/22, mini-FESS: bilateral anterior ethmoidectomy and bilateral maxillary antrostomy, no in-surgery complications. 

About 2 days post-op, I started to feel ‘off’ and just in general was not feeling very well. Headaches, neck pain, nausea, dizziness, and really bad tinnitus. I also began to have clear and clear/orange-ish liquid coke shooting out of my nose, happening intermittently and taking turns between the two nostrils. It especially came dripping out when bending my head down or laying on my side. 

I told my ENT who’s performed my surgery, who advised us to get a CT w/o contrast at the ER. I had the CT done, and didn’t really have any symptoms when I got the CT besides headache. ENT and radiologist looked at scan and didn’t see any abnormal bone things or osseous findings (?), so we went home relieved. However, I’ve been feeling worse, my symptoms aren’t improving, and I’m still having this liquid pour out of my nose intermittently, and it looks, smells, and feels unlike anything I’ve ever had, and stands out from the normal post-sinus surgery drainage and discharge. I really only feel moderately fine when I’m lying down as well, and my headaches don’t even go away with the Percocet my surgeon prescribed. 

I collected a decent amount of the fluid, and my ENT is getting it tested through a Beta-2 transferrin test ASAP, but he said it could take up to a week to get results, so in the meantime I’ve been told to basically do bed rest and keep my head elevated. 

I know that only the treat will give me and my doctor a definitive answer, but I’m just worried and tired of feeling so terrible.  

Does this sound like a possibility of a CSF leak? And do CT scans always find them, or does it depend?

My Sister gave me her Cold/Bug whatever it is. My throat feels like sand paper, I’ve been gagging and throwing up due to the Inflammation of my uvula. Im having tonsil stones, a fever and a clogged noes. On top of all that it’s finals week so I’m sure the stress is not helping. I was unable to go to the restroom this afternoon due to me throwing up when I tried. Overall I feel like shit.

I am prone to and have chronic ear infections due to small ear canals. I am TERRIFIED this will turn into an ear infection. My ear drums are covered in scars and last time I had one the overwhelmed medial system had me wait a week to see my primary care doctor. The hospitals are so busy I probably would be waiting for days in the waiting room if I went in for an ear infection. Last time it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. I don’t want to say I was suicidal, but I was close to doing whatever I could to stop the pain. 

I was able to get medication for it from a phone clinic after three days and still had to get more medication from my doctor the later appointment. I was also allergic to the ear drops so thank god the antibiotics worked. (I had to take two rounds). 

How do I prevent this from becoming an ear infection? My ears are already leaking a clear fluid and I’ve been sleeping on my back in hopes to prevent favouring one ear. Is it already infected or is this just my sinuses trying to release mucus? 

On another note, I tend to hallucinate when I have fevers. They usually only last a day or two but it’s scary not knowing what’s reality and what is not. I have finals to submit and I’m afraid I will hallucinate submitting them. My hallucinations cover al my senses so it’s hard to tell what’s real.  The fevers don’t have to be bad for the hallucinations, just a big enough fever to notice. Any tips to manage this?

She's got into an accident and claims to have injured her back. She's been to more than one doctor that said she was fine. She claimed they were ""quacks"" and she planned to sue them too. 

Recently, she claims to have gone to an urgent care and gotten x-rays. She claimed they wouldn't show her the x-rays because they were ""so bad"" (riiiight...) and that she was going to need surgery or ""get her affairs in order"".

The next day she sent me a picture of a picture of an x-ray, claiming it was hers. It won't let me post pictures to this sub so, I'll post it to my profile and link it in the comments. It does *not* look like the x-ray of a person that can walk. She shows no signs of this. She continues to go about her day ""normally"" (as much as that word applies to her). This includes a lot of heavy lifting, power tools usage, and other labor intensive, meth-fueled ""projects"" she spends day and night working on.

I am hesitant to use the word ""fatigue"" because I'm not drained but I feel a lack of energy every day, even with 7-8 hours of sleep.

Honestly I'm freaking out because when I google my symptoms, it's returning scary results, like cancer. I'm not sure if a blood workup would screen for any serious like that, but my doctor didn't order any other exams. What else can I do?

776,AskDocs,"Backstory: my 1 year old son picked up a double ear infection at day care about two weeks ago and suffered fevers in the 102-103 range for about a week. We took him to the pediatrician and he has since recovered.

Fast forward to this past Thursday, I (34M) start to feel a scratch in my throat. By Friday evening I’m measuring a fever of 102. I’ve got sinus pressure, green mucus, sore throat, muscle pain

Pure agony, this is worse than the bout of COVID I got in January. And it lasts all weekend.

Fast forward even more to today. I spend the entire day on the couch tracking my temps. This morning at around 5 AM I measure 98-ish. Praise the lord! But things pick right back up by 8 AM.

I’m a data guy so I start tracking an average or three readings ever so often. Around 7:39 PM EST I measure a fever of 104 (not recorded because I was in too much pain). I’m back in it and I’m so. fucking. OVER THIS!

I haven’t gone to urgent care for a number of reasons that are probably silly, but ultimately I just feel like shit and I don’t feel up to it.

So my question is… what do I do? Weather the storm or go to urgent care.

I have had an issue with pain in this area before, but it was brushed off. My neck has been hurting before this, as has my shoulder, but the Gabapentin had been helping with that before. It's now back. This same spot on my shoulder blade has been hurting for several days, but it was only if I lied down. I also have had problems with my hand going numb after a walk, and my back hurts while I walk, but I don't think that's related. It also hurts if I rub my spine near the area.

Is this shoulder blade pain anything serious? I'm not sure what's going on, or how to deal with it. It still hurts now, but I can move my arm and type.

785,AskDocs,"Is my body rejecting my depo shot?


Hello. I am a 26F, smoker (recently quit cigarettes and now have a vape pen). No medications. I am anemic and I’m known to have ovarian cysts. I was on the depo shot for 4 years and I loved it. I had 0 issues. No spotting of bleeding, aside from my regular monthly period. No weight gain or mood swings. I stopped taking it for a few years. Then in 2020 I became pregnant. The day I gave birth, my OBGYN gave me the depo shot. I then bled almost a year consistently. When I asked about it, he said it should clear up and that it could also be a side affect of the depo. I stopped for almost a year as I was struggling with PPD, PPA, and was also diagnosed with BPD and PTSD. I ended up pregnant in December of this last year. I had a surgical abortion Jan 31st of this year. I went back in the depo the same day. However, I am having the bleeding consistently again. I have had 1 week of no bleeding. Now it’s back to the brownish blood. Here and there, there will be fresh bright red blood, but then it goes away almost the same day, if not the next day and goes back to the brownish blood. 
I am at a loss. Is my body rejecting the depo shot since I have had my daughter? Is there something I can do to get it to stop? I prefer the depo- but I also don’t want to continue down this path.

For the last 5 years I’ve been constantly tired. I try to explain this to others, but it always gets brushed off since I have two little children and a stressful job….but I can honestly say that I love my job and the kids don’t stress me out. The tiredness on the weekends are just as bad.
I sleep a full 7-8 hours and have no issues staying asleep.

I have a headache every day without fail &amp; feel like I am on a caffeine low and ready to sleep. Because of this I do drink a lot of caffeine, but less than 350mg per day. 

I am so irritable that I am beginning to cause major issues in my marriage and within my family. 

I recently got sick with COVID and was prescribed Pregnisone. While I was on it, I felt alive again. I didn’t feel tired at all, until it was time to sleep. I wasn’t irritable. I felt better mentally then I ever have before- and I had symptoms of COVID for 12 days! The prescription eventually ran out. 

I don’t want to live my life on a steroid, but it seems like this would indicate that something else is wrong. 

Any ideas? What should I do?

Thank you in advance

I've had pain in this area for at least 2 years now, and had always dismissed it as me being careless. Recently while massaging it I noticed a small patch of redness and a unmovable bony lump underneath it. Now I'm worried. I went to the nurse practitioner today, and she told me it was most likely shin splints , but it doesn't feel like shin splints and I had them before. Running/ walking doesn't really have an affect on it (and its finals season right now so Im not exactly very active these days), and it only really hurts at night or when I press on it. What could it be? Im really anxious right now. Thank you!

799,AskDocs,Hi everyone I just wanted to come here before I go to the Gyno again. Seems like I’m not really being listened to but also maybe it’s just me and my doctor is right. I’m 23f been on birth control for 8 years. I’ve been having extreme itching in one specific spot kind of to the left of where I pee but above in the pubic area. If it gets bad enough it also tears my skin and I have some blood. It comes and goes every month or two. This has gone on now 2 years. I thought they were just yeast infections (my whole life Ive gotten them often but this is definitely way different) but eventually after a year I was like no way since it’s not even itching on the inside. Gyno told me no big deal looks like one of my yeast infections went into my skin. Gave me clotrimazole and told me “you know you can just buy this at the store next time”. Made me feel like it just wasn’t a big deal. But now I’m here again after applying it for a month (and then trying again 3 months later) and its still here.

**OTC:** none
**Substances:** recreational marijuana usage (socially, at most 1-2 weekly)

I was due yesterday, my period app has informed me that I am one day late! I am completely freaking out and sent my boyfriend to go buy pregnancy tests. We are having sex with condoms and using NFP but this last month we had protected sex on like Day 9 of my cycle, he does not finish in me as well we use withdrawal way before he even gets close too!
.
Before today, I had some breast soreness but that has gone away since this morning. I had some mild brown spotting last night and this afternoon but it has since gone away completely. If I leave a menstrual cup in I get just the tiniest amount of blood (not bright red, just pink/brown).
.
I know stress can delay periods and I have 3 very big exams this week for my masters so I know that I’m stressed, but I don’t actually feel all that nervous about my exams idk!

The cough is awful at night and will turn into hours of misery. I clear my throat alot... eating makes it worse. 

Anyway, about a month ago I coughed after eating dinner and felt a sharp pain in my throat. it was really bad. Over a few days it kept happening sporadically, until one night I coughed after inhaling some pepper while cooking and I felt a tearing sensation and completely lost my voice. I ended up in the ER and got a decadron shot. They looked at my throat with a flashlight, asked me what happened and told me I injured my vocal cords. I was sent home with a diagnosis of laryngitis and an order to follow up with an ENT. I am still waiting on the ENT appointment. 

The decadron seemed to help a little, but the last week it's started to come back. I've been trying really hard not to cough, but I had to tonight and this time I had the same pain and started coughing up mucous with blood in it. my throat hurts on one side and I'm hoarse.

811,AskDocs,"44F, dx with hypersomnia ~10 years ago (currently managed with 20mg adderall 1x/day), right nephrectomy (altruistic donor in 2019), Mirena IUD (2019).  I have had intermittent night-sweats for the last year or so that have been attributed to perimenopause. Limited alcohol use, no recreational drug use, regular exercise…generally a healthy, average human being.  

December 2018, all routine labs from annual physical were within normal limits, but my pcp observed my thyroid felt enlarged and scheduled an ultrasound.  US report from December 2018 states both thyroid lobes were normal in size and echogenicity and both lobes also had nodules/lesions which should be checked in one year.

January 2020, all routine (and kidney function-specific) labs from annual physical were again within normal limits.  Thyroid US report mentions the ‘smaller cystic nodules’ which do not meet TI-RADS criteria for follow-up and that was that.  All subsequent lab work has been within normal limits.

Fast-forward to this year, I had to wear a button-down dress shirt for the first time in a year (Firefighter/EMT Class A uniform that we only dust off for parades and funerals…) and couldn’t button the top button.  Like not even close, not even with a coworker’s help. A week later my pcp acknowledged that my thyroid was in fact enlarged and scheduled another US…which just came back with a report of a ‘normal appearing thyroid gland with no discrete nodules’.  My pcp has recommended a neck CT.  

Noteworthy (to me, since I’m the one with a fat neck): in December 2018 the 2 lobes measured at 47x16x15mm/53x16x19mm.  In April 2023 the 2 lobes measured at 52x19x15mm/51x14x19mm.  I definitely have discomfort when wearing a turtleneck or when pushing on that area (‘testing it out’, trying to button a dress shirt, etc).

Questions: is one lobe growing and the other lobe shrinking or could that be the US tech’s interpretation?  If my thyroid is growing, is it treatable or will I just be the girl with the fat neck forever?  What would the CT reveal and/or what would they be checking for, and what questions should I be asking?

I already take Lactaid and Rx Pepcid, as my gastro has suggested acid reflux, but in researching it it seems weird that it’s only caused by pizza, and so soon after I eat. They mentioned I could try food allergy testing, but that the reaction isn’t usually so immediate for allergies. 

Any gastros/docs in here know what could be causing this? It’s happened one or two times with other foods, but usually just from pizza.

Doctors other response is “don’t eat pizza” so I do eat it less, but still would like to understand the underlying issue.

For the past three years I have dealt with debilitating fatigue that doesn’t seem to get better regardless of different treatment methods. My friends and family joke about how I’m a toddler with the amount of naps I have to take daily, regardless of how much sleep I get the night before. I take vyvanse for my adhd throughout the week and I honestly sleep the best when I take it. I did test positive for a previous mono infection back in Nov. 2020, but it wasn’t an active infection. 

I have had my iron checked several times over the years and my ferritin was 4 ng/mL back in July 2021. I got two rounds of iron infusions September 2021 which resulted in my ferritin going up to 40 in Jan 2022. Went back to recheck my levels March 2022, my ferritin had dropped to 6. My periods are not heavy so I’m not sure why I continue to lose so much iron. 

I’ve had upper &amp; lower GI done, only thing out of ordinary were several small ulcers on upper GI. Allergy panel came back normal, H.pylori test came back normal, so chalked it up to stress. Prescribed nexium 40mg and carafate 4 times a day. 

I’m honestly just at a loss. I can’t enjoy a lot of things because I get so irritable because I am so exhausted. I feel like I’m just being dramatic or a hypochondriac, but I just don’t know.

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal FLAIR T1, sagittal FSE T2, sagittal STIR, axial fat-saturated FSE T2, axial T1.

FINDINGS: 5 lumbar vertebrae are assumed. Chronic superior end plate compression deformity, of mild degree at L2 and very mild degree at L3, unchanged. Remaining lumbar vertebral height is maintained. Marrow signal appears benign. Interval osseous posterior spinal fusion and interbody fusion at L4-5 and L5-S1 are noted. Additional left hemilaminectomy and partial facetectomy at L5-S1, stable. Interval left hemilaminectomy at L4-5 is seen. There is no abnormal dorsal paraspinal fluid collection or intrathecal arachnoiditis. The distal thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris, terminating at the lower L1 level, are normal-appearing. Visualized upper sacroiliac joints are mildly degenerated, stable. There is no abnormal paraspinal mass.

By intervertebral disc levels:
L5-S1: Unchanged left hemilaminectomy. Interval left partial facetectomy, osseous posterior spinal fusion, and interbody fusion. Stable mild residual circumferential disc bulging without ventral thecal sac deformity or central canal stenosis. Patent left neural foramen. Mild right neural foraminal stenosis without exiting nerve root deformity, stable.

L4-5: Interval left hemilaminectomy, interbody and osseous posterior spinal fusion. Resolution of circumferential disc bulging. Patent central canal and neural foramina.

L3-4: Mild circumferential disc bulging. New prominent dorsal ligamentous and moderate facet hypertrophy. Development of moderate to severe central canal stenosis with midline AP thecal sac dimension of 4.5 mm. Near effacement of intrathecal CSF. Patent neural foramina.

L2-3: Increased with mild to moderate circumferential disc bulging. Facet and dorsal epidural fat hypertrophy. Development of moderate central canal stenosis with midline AP thecal sac dimension of 6.5 mm. Crowding of distal nerve roots. Patent neural foramina.

L1-L2: Minor disc bulging. No central canal stenosis. Mild facet arthrosis bilaterally. Patent neural foramina.

stabbing crippling pain in the pelvic floor(?) area, sometimes lasting an hour or two, sometimes just a few seconds, comes suddenly (no observed trigger) without relief, on top of that waking up at night with limbs being either numb or tingling in any position (not caused by me laying on them etc.). Feeling very cold sometimes as well

I've been struggling with this issue for a few months now, approx 6 months, first, it would be just after orgasms but now without prompts. I don't have money for medical care and would appreciate any tips I can get or at least some kind of idea of what it could be

837,AskDocs,"I (Female, 23) have the flu. I'm currently on day 5 and have prior to today not had any nausea. Yesterday I went to Urgent Care and they prescribed me Ibuprofen and plain Mucinex. Since I started taking it, it has been a battle to keep food down and I finally, after trying to keep it down all day threw up all my hard work in one foul swoop.

Last July the same thing happened. I got my wisdom teeth out. My wisdom teeth were all impacted, infected, and growing into my sinuses so the surgery was very involved. The first day I was only on the dental pain killer but it didn't work. I was sobbing through the entire procedure and when I woke up I was wailing and could only say ""I can't do this"" until I passed out.

The next day I was taking oxy but extremely nauseous. I threw up everything I ate. They then prescribed me Percocet. The same thing happened. It was puke city. The third day I said fuck it- no painkillers and no puking transpired since. 

So what gives? Why does over the counter advil make me puke just as much as high level opioids? 

MORE INFO:
I am sober. I hardly drink, I don't smoke. I tried edibles and I got so dizzy I puked. I don't have a long history of either.

844,AskDocs,"Hello, I joined reddit just so I could ask this question. 

A couple weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night with a huge swollen area on my face and neck. It was extremely painful. I went to the ER, where I eventually got a CT scan. The CT identified a small lesion that had originally been identified in 2016. The lesion is bigger now. The scan also showed a fluid build up. The ER doctor showed me a print out of the scan (which unfortunately wasn't included in my discharge papers). He pointed to two things, so I understood that as showing the lesion and the fluid build up were not one thing, but two. But I can't see the scan in my online medical record.

I was discharged. Over the course of two days, the swollen area progressed down over my collar bone and around the back of my neck. It was pretty unpleasant! On day 4, I got an Fine Needle Aspiration to remove the fluid.

I can see the Cytology report of the fluid online, but I don't understand what it means. I googled the terms, and it said they were potentially associated with a cancer of the epithelial cells or esophageal cancer. I have a history of GERD and ulcers, and the GI doctor had told me that puts me at risk for esophageal cancer, so seeing that was kind of alarming.

Should I call someone about getting additional testing or another Endoscopy to see if I have damage to my esophagus?

Required stats: 38F, 5'3"", 200lbs, white; I don't drink or smoke or use any drugs

History of GERD (taking 20mg omeprazole 2x day most days);  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (taking Diomox 500mg 2x day); I also have a kidney stone but I doubt that's related to this.

Here's the reports from my scans and stuff:

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 Endoscopy**

&gt; A single 8 mm polyp was found at the  
gastroesophageal junction. Biopsies were taken with  
a cold forceps for histology.  
One linear esophageal ulcer with no bleeding and no  
stigmata of recent bleeding was found. Biopsies were  
taken with a cold forceps for histology.  
Impression: - Normal examined duodenum. Biopsied.  
\- Erosive gastritis. Biopsied.  
\- Gastroesophageal junction polyp(s) was found.  
Biopsied.  
\- Non-bleeding esophageal ulcer likely related to  
reflux. Biopsied. 

The biopsied stuff turned out fine.

&gt;COMMENT:  
The background also shows some amorphous and needle-like extracellular  
material Immunostains performed on the cell block reveal occasional cells  
staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and macrophages that are highlighted by  
CD163. There are very rare cells staining for p40 and DSG-3. The overall  
features favor the presence of an acute inflammatory process. The  
significance of the rare atypical cells is uncertain. In the context of  
abundant acute inflammation, they could represent reactive atypia. However,  
an undersampled neoplastic process or neoplastic cells obscured by the severe  
acute inflammation is not entirely excluded. Clinical and microbiological  
correlation with appropriate follow-up is recommended. If the lesion persists  
or progresses, repeat sampling could be considered.

&gt;The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, insitu  
hybridization (ISH &amp; FISH), molecular &amp; genomic pathology, and  
immunofluorescence testing:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The testing was developed and its performance characteristics determined by  
the Department of Pathology, as required by the CLIA '88 regulations. The  
testing has not been cleared or approved for the specific use by the U.S. Food  
and Drug Administration, but the FDA has determined such approval is not  
necessary for clinical use. Tissue fixation ranges from a minimum of 6 to a  
maximum of 96 hours. Immunohistochemical stains (where applicable) are  
performed with appropriate positive and negative control reactions.  
Immunohistochemistry assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues.  
Results should be interpreted with caution given the raised possibility of  
false negativity on decalcified specimens. Methods of staining, performance  
characteristics, and validation assays of all antibodies in our test menu that  
are in clinical use are described in our laboratory test catalogue and readily  
available upon clinician, patient, or pathologist request.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement  
Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical  
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this laboratory  
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional  
information about this type of test is available upon request.

**April 2023 CT report**

&gt;Impression:  
Mild nonspecific edema about the inferior anterior right parotid  
gland. No abscess or evidence of calculi. This may represent mild  
parotiditis.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Within the posterior/medial aspect of the right parotid gland  
inferiorly there is a 1.5 x 1.6 x 3.1 cm lesion. It is possible this  
represents an increase in size of the previously seen small cystic  
lesion in this location on MRI of 2017 with internal complex  
proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content, but the appearance is more  
suggestive of a solid lesion and low-grade neoplasm cannot be  
excluded (i.e. pleomorphic adenoma).  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrative  
&gt;  
&gt;Clinical History:  
Acute parotiditis on the right, rapidly progressing.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Comparison:  
Multiple prior studies including MRI from 06/01/2017.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Technique:  
CT of the face including administration of intravenous contrast.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Findings:  
Along the posteromedial aspect of the right parotid gland there is a  
relative soft tissue density well demarcated lesion measuring 1.6 x  
1.5 x 3.4 cm. This does not have cystic characteristics on this exam  
although on remote prior imaging there did appear to be a small  
cystic lesion in this region.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no ductal dilatation or evidence of calculi. There is a mild  
degree of indistinct soft tissue stranding at the anterior inferior  
aspect of the parotid gland and deep to the platysma suggestive of  
edema. No abscess.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The left parotid gland is normal in appearance.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;No suspicious appearing lymph nodes or osseous destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

**December 2017 MRI**

&gt;Impression  
&gt;  
&gt;1. No acute intracranial abnormality.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. T2 bright nonenhancing lesion within the right parotid tail. This  
is favored to represent a complex intraparotid cyst. A follow-up in  
12 months is recommended.  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrative  
&gt;  
&gt;CLINICAL INDICATION: Cranial nerve palsy, right parotid mass, left  
facial paresthesias, disease of the salivary glands.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;PROCEDURE: Skull base MR. A total of 19 cc of MultiHance contrast  
were administered. No documented contrast reaction.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;COMPARISON: MR brain 05/09/2016. Comparison is also made to an MR  
dated 06/01/2017.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;FINDINGS:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The brain parenchymal signal is overall within normal limits. There  
is no focal restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarction.  
Whole brain postcontrast images demonstrate no pathologic  
intracranial enhancement. The ventricles are unremarkable. There is  
no abnormal extraaxial fluid collections. No mass effect or midline  
shift. There is a T2 bright lesion within the inferior right parotid  
gland which does demonstrate a fluid-fluid level. No substantial  
enhancement is identified. Overall, this is favored to represent a  
slightly complex intraparotid cyst. This is likely slightly increased  
from MR dated 05/09/2016 but is similar in appearance to the study  
from 06/01/2017. No particularly aggressive features. Overall, on the  
T2-weighted images, this measures 1 cm transverse by 7 mm AP by 1.5  
cm craniocaudal.

 **June 2017 MRI**

&gt;Impression  
&gt;  
&gt;Impression:  
Unremarkable MRI of the brain without evidence for an acute  
infarction or neoplasm. Stable lesion within the posterior aspect of  
the superficial portion of the right parotid gland with the  
differential of intraparotid lymph node or lymphoepithelial lesion.  
No evidence for retrobulbar or retro-orbital abnormality is seen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrative  
&gt;  
&gt;Clinical Information:  
Benign lymphoepithelial lesion of the right salivary gland. History  
of headaches for the last 1 week with left-sided numbness and  
tingling.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Comparison:  
MRI of the brain on 05/09/2016 at \[redacted\] Hospital. CT scan  
of the head on 05/13/2016 at \[redacted\] Hospital.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Technique:  
Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the tissues of the neck and orbits  
was obtained without and with contrast administration. A total of 20  
cc of MultiHance was given intravenously  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Findings:  
The pituitary gland, infundibulum and optic chasm appear normal. No  
tonsillar herniation is seen. On the diffusion and ADC mapping  
imaging, no acute infarction is seen. There is presence of normal  
ventricular system, basal cisterns and cortical sulci. Fourth  
ventricle is in the midline and no shift of the midline structures is  
seen. The prepontine and cerebellopontine angle cisterns are normal.  
Seventh eighth nerve complex is normal. The vestibulocochlear region  
is normal. Mastoid air cells and internal acoustic canals are normal.  
Normal signal void of bilateral vertebrals, basilar internal carotid  
arteries is seen. There are no areas of signal abnormality seen in  
the gray and white matter regions.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;There is noted mucosal thickening of the ethmoid and maxillary  
sinuses. The sphenoid and frontal sinuses are clear.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Within the right parotid gland is presence of an 8 mm ovoid structure  
within the posterior aspect of the superficial portion of the right  
parotid gland immediately posterior to the right retrobulbar and vein  
as described on the CT scan of 05/13/2016. This shows a high signal  
intensity on T2-weighted images and measures 13.7 mm superoinferiorly  
and shows no enhancement on administration of contrast and probably  
represents an intraparotid lymph node or a lymphoepithelial lesion as  
described. This is unlikely to represent a pleomorphic adenoma or a  
cyst. The remaining portions of the parotid glands appear normal  
bilaterally. Orbits including the retrobulbar and retro-orbital  
regions appear normal. The optic nerves are normal. The extraocular  
muscles appear normal and no intraconal or extraconal enhancing  
lesions are seen. The lacrimal glands appear normal. On  
administration of contrast there is normal vascular enhancement seen.  
No abnormal areas of enhancement are seen.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 2016 CT** 

&gt;IMPRESSION:  
1. Small cystic nodule within the superficial right parotid  
immediately posterior to the retromandibular vein. This lesion does  
not have definite aggressive features. Leading differential  
considerations include a small neoplasm such as a pleomorphic  
adenoma, intraparotid cyst and less likely an intraparotid lymph node.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. The remaining portions of the neck appears unremarkable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrative  
&gt;  
&gt;CLINICAL HISTORY:  
Other diseases of salivary glands  
  
&gt;  
&gt;COMPARISON:  
Head MRI dated 05/09/2016  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TECHNIQUE:  
Contiguous axial tomographic slices were obtained through the neck  
following the immediately uncomplicated intravenous administration of  
100 cc Isovue-370. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;FINDINGS:  
Within the superficial right parotid gland, immediately posterior to  
the retromandibular vein, is an 8 mm ovoid structure that corresponds  
to the abnormality noted on the recent MRI. The parotid parenchyma  
appears unremarkable.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The left parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands are unremarkable.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The visualized intracranial and intraorbital contents appear grossly  
unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells  
are clear. Temporomandibular joints are grossly intact.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;There are no pathologic appearing lymph nodes within the cervical  
nodal stations.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The pharynx and larynx are intact.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The lung apices are mildly degraded by motion although grossly clear.

I only recently noticed this, I've never really looked at my finger prints before. On the top middle of my index finger, my finger print seems to stop being lines and is instead dots. It looks exactly the same as the rest of my finger, but just a different pattern. 

What is this? What causes it? 

I was able to find one other person with the same thing from an old reddit post. Since I can't get a picture good enough to see, I'll link a close up of theirs. Mine looks exactly the same.

854,AskDocs,"[26m] Have recently been struggling to get rid of what feels like thick Muscas or lump that has gotten stuck at the back of throat inbetween nasopharynx and oropharynx. 

I have always have had long term acid reflux (details aware surrounding this and not important here) and I have had it amplified due to anxiety/panic attacks which seems to have been the causing of the lump from looking back at when it started. I had always felt like I couldn’t swallow food properly or in general while the flare ups came with a lot of throat muscle/neck tension. 
I would forcably try and control how much I swollowed or how I would swallow food when this happens in order not to let it go down the wrong whole as it was such a challenge, I would also try not to burp or let air bubbles escape as I felt this amplify my anxiety attacks. This would obviously cause significant scorching in my throat from always having stomach acid come back up the oesophagus but never like this untill one day I had it happen where the muscles in my throat were extremely tight and with GErd just all the usual symptoms butand while still desperately trying to get some food in my stomach, it was as if every time I swallowed bites of food it seems to feel like some of it was tryjng to go down a wrong hole. Whether or not some of it did or acid reflux pushed back an object of food into my nasal or ear canals I’m not sure, but it has not cleared since.
It’s so horrible!! I can feel it now even while my throat muscles are relaxed and while eating food now it is severely uncomfortable like I have an opening which is letting it get into my ear or in the wrong place each time I eat food, I can literally sense it in my ear it’s horrible.

When I first felt itchy I went to an urgent care to test for a yeast infection but they told me I actually had a UTI and gave me antibiotics. The UTI symptoms came back so I finished another course of antibiotics, which cleared the UTI but the itchiness remained. 

I decided to go to my gyno and was tested for another UTI, BV, trich/other STDS, and yeast. All negative and was told to stay dry since it was summertime. Fast forward a month later and I was in the ER for an infected ingrown hair on my labia, which cleared up with antibiotics. However, after completing the antibiotics, the intense itching returned and I occasionally still feel some pain (far less intense) in the same spot where the ingrown hair was. 

I’ve been self treating for the past 8 months by switching to a hypoallergenic laundry detergent, taking stitz baths, and only washing that area with clean hands/warm water. This helped a bit but ultimately the itch is still there and I’ve started to notice small amounts of brownish/bloody discharge. 

I went to my gyno again today and they said i’m red on the outside but have no idea why. They said I have a high white blood cell count in my urine and are going to do further tests (I’m not really sure what for). I’m so frustrated because no one seems to be taking me seriously and this severe itching has been almost ruining my life.

I did recently get new work shoes (Vans) but they are the same kind as my old ones so I don’t think it could be the cause? I have no rashes, no blisters, no redness other than the scratch marks from itching. I’m using the same laundry detergent as usual. I also recently had a circular quarter size rash pop up on my upper butt cheek that lasted a few days but has for the part disappeared now. It itched for a day or two. Didn’t really itch until I touched it.

The problem is, my dad is showing early signs of dementia. He has lost his filter. He’s addicted to porn and literally chasing my poor mother around the house. She is wearing a pessary and the doctor told me that he could seriously hurt/damage her if he has sex with her while the pessary is inserted. 

My mother has never even used a tampon and does not know how to remove, clean, or reinsert the device. I’ve been taking her to the doctor every 3 months to have it cleaned. I’ve offered to help her, but she’s too embarrassed and won’t let me. 

My dad is getting conflicting information from the internet and thinks it’s okay to have sex with a pessary. He’s become angry and abusive.

What can I do to make sure that my dad doesn’t hurt her? They are literally locking me out of the house during their “fun” time. I know for a fact that my mom does not enjoy it. It hurts her. Are there any SAFE ways to calm him down? He’s acting like a freak and torturing my poor mom.

In some cases I’ve been asked that and then by the end of the conversation told that I need to exercise more and eat healthier to get my weight down.

Also, I noticed that the 1 inch square area around the mole is raised or swollen a little (It feels weird when pressed but doesn't hurt), It feels different from rest of the skin on my chest as I can directly feel the bone underneath but not under the mole  


I've realized that I do need to go see a dermatologist based on what I've read in articles, which I'll do in couple of days, but I couldn't stop thinking about it and wanted to post here.

899,AskDocs,"So I (20m) was finally diagnosed with ADHD back in December. Off topic, but I really don't know how my parents could have possibly thought I was ""normal"" lol, but anyways;  

Just recently, a few weeks ago, I had an online appointment with a psychologist (work benefits gives us like 4 free sessions a year). She reaffirmed that I most definitely had ADHD, but also added on ASD. Granted the two share a lot of symptoms and likeness, but she said I was most definitely both and not just one or the other. 

Well, since my initial diagnosis of ADHD I was put on Adderall IR 5 then 10mg. I kept forgetting to take my second dose so my doctor switch me to XR. Initially I was on 20mg, but the effectiveness only lasted about a month, which I thought was because I had to switch pharmacy's due to shortage, but after going back to my pharmacy it still didn't work, so three months I get upped to 25mg XR and honestly it feels the exact same as it did when I wasn't on anything. I feel disassociated, unmotivated, mentally exhausted, unfocused, and my head is still going a mile a minute. I take it at 6 or 7 in the morning before work usually. And all throughout the day I'm just waiting and waiting for it to kick in. Then I get home, and around 5 or 6 where I actually can get some things done, until an hour goes by and it's right back down. I don't want to go back and ask for me and make my doctor think I'm just a druggy or something.

So long rant short, should a 5mg increase in XR have any kind of affect? Is it too low of an increase to really notice? Should I possibly ask about going back to IR or maybe a mix of IR and XR? I'd like your all's input but I will of course be going back and talking to my doctor about it as well.

902,AskDocs,"(22M) I tore my right medial meniscus after a collision during a Volleyball game. I went to an orthopaedic but he falsely diagnosed my injury as a bruised tendon/meniscus. He told me to take time off volleyball. (No clicking or locking of the knee)

At first I was having trouble climbing up and down the stairs, bending my knee and jumping. So I took a 2 weeks break from Volleyball Training. During this duration I did some stretching exercises and some isometrics to keep the knee mobile and strong.

Went back to playing volleyball but my knee hurts a bit after but pain was probably around 3/10. I was still having slight pain on stairs and while bending. 

Out of nowhere while I was just walking my knee somewhat „gave up“ and the pain was there again. I was unable to bend my leg backwards and I got an appointment with another orthopaedic. After MRI it was found that I tore my medial meniscus on my right knee and it was grade 1 on the outer layer. My second appointment with him is by the end of May. I am aware that since it’s on the outer layer, it has a chance of getting naturally healed without surgery.

During these past three weeks I stopped volleyball and jumping entirely and focused on REHAB exercises like stretching followed by body weighted squats and lunges on the third week.

Coming into fourth week, which is now, I started lifting weights. Doing quarter squats instead of deep squats, deadlifts and leg extensions together with some glute workouts to strengthen my legs and relieve some pressure on my knee. I’m also taking glucosamine supplements once a day.

For now I have no pain climbing up and down stairs, squatting etc even after the gym session. The only time I felt a slight discomfort is when i lunge, up to the point whereby my knee is in front of my toe. Or when I twist my knee and foot inwards. And the discomfort only arise at very specific or rather awkward positions of my knee. I would say the pain is a 1-2/10. 

I’m just afraid that when I incorporate some jump or plyometrics exercises my knee will get re-injured for the 3rd time. 

In my current state, should I start with some light jogging and jumping exercises together with my weight training(squats, deadlifts, etc) next week? And maybe start playing volleyball once a week? Or should I just workout without any jumps until the next month or so until I feel no pain while twisting my knee? Is it ok to feel slight discomfort on my knee after a jump workout or a volleyball session? Will it be normal for me to feel slight discomfort after volleyball or a jumping session for the rest of my years with this meniscus tear?

I’m planning to ease my way back to Volleyball and hopefully y’all can help me out with some advices on this.

I have been to an ENT for this thinking it was sinus congestion but my sinus CT scan showed no issues.

I am a male 58 yo, 200 lbs, 6 feet white caucasian.  I am HIV + , undetectable for almost 20 years my last CD4 count was around 600/700 (sept 2022). Last year in October 2022 ( first two pix) I awoke up with a deformed penis, and the shaft and scrotum were itching like hell. I am  circumcise since my teen and this  never  happened to me until last year, long story short my doctor was in vacation and they did not have anyone that could see me , even if the picture is gross it dint caused me pain.

So I ended up at Emergency care and emergency room but after few days it back to the normal shape and size, but I never been told why that happened and the 5 doctors that saw me had no clue, I never done any test because my doctor was still in vacation and at the ER told me that couldn't do any tests. (??).  Since then I decide to change doctor but the first appointment available with a new doctor was down the road April 14th 2023, however on the 10 of April they cancel the appointment and they want to reschedule for June. Frustrated I decide to change the provider so hopefully in May I will see a doctor.

But I woke up on the 14  of this month with my shaft puffed up once again (3rd pix) never reached the gross shape of last year, and also the itching was back.

Last year, I ended up having horrible stomach pains that ended up being appendicitis and subsequently a ruptured appendix. It wasn’t until the appendix was taken out that they, of course, incidentally found the neuroendocrine tumor on the appendix.

The tumor was 0.4cm, G1, pT1 , well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor which invades the muscularis propria and was in the distal half of appendix.

My question is, because my appendix ruptured with this tumor, is there any chance of spread? I've poured over multiple papers and there is no clear agreed answer on what happens if the appendix does perforate with this cancer.

I did get a colonoscopy that didn't show anything anywhere else, but should I still worry that because the appendix did burst with the cancer in it, that it could have spread once that happened?",t2_86kkr,0,30F/Neuroendocrine Tumor of the Appendix?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,This user has not yet been verified.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12pxima,True,miloblue12,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12pxima/30fneuroendocrine_tumor_of_the_appendix/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12pxima/30fneuroendocrine_tumor_of_the_appendix/,475549,1681766817,0,,False,1681766834,1681766834,2023-04-17 21:26:57,,,

Location: Orange County, California; full body fatigue with sudden brain fog/fatigue

Any existing relevant medical issues: I have diagnosed ADHD and Depression. I was diagnosed with ADHD 15-17 years ago and Depression within the last year but the fatigue/clarity waves have been happening for many years now.

Current medications: 40mg Vyvanse, taken once daily in the morning, and 20mg Lexapro taken at the same time.

Description of symptoms: Every few days, throughout the day, regardless of what I'm doing or eating, I experience waves of extreme fatigue to the point I nearly fall asleep, followed by a sudden surge in physical and mental energy. I do not do anything in particular to combat the fatigue when it hits, it simply melts away and is replaced by sudden clarity and alertness until the next ""attack"". This is not a daily occurrence, it seems to happen on random days but on days it happens I am beleaguered by it all day long. It feels similar to the sensation of getting an adrenaline rush when the fatigue wave ends and my alertness comes online, almost as if it were too sudden to be natural and is often slightly uncomfortable, with a spike of anxiety from noise and light levels accompanied by a rushing heart rate for a minute or two before it levels out to a simple state of alertness. The level of alertness it settles at is the regular level I remember from years ago just being awake in the day like a normal person.

My blood glucose levels are within normal ranges whenever I'm tested (always fasting per instructions) and my last test was about two months ago prior to me beginning a new medication plan for my newly diagnosed depression and continuing diagnosis of ADHD. My cholesterol is only slightly elevated in LDL but is normal for HDL. My testosterone level is below the threshold for what is considered medically healthy at my age, but my insurance provider will not cover Testosterone supplementation therapy because it is going through my wife's employer which is a Catholic healthcare system and so any and all therapies which would affect the reproductive system are not covered by the plan. I do partake in recreational marijuana at night only, and I do not drink alcohol outside of occasional social events where cannabis is not allowed (work parties mostly). I get about 7 hours of sleep every night and wake up feeling fine each day. I do not have a family history of narcolepsy or other sleep disorders, but I do snore, though I've never seemed to have a problem with breathing while asleep per my wife's observations (she is an NP with a focus on women's health).

I have a sleep study scheduled for this Friday but as I just nearly fell asleep at my desk at work I felt like now would be a good time to put this out in the world and see if anyone has suggestions for possible causes or solutions because I'm at my wit's end with this rollercoaster of energy.",t2_vx0d1fho,0,"I [33m] get waves of fatigue throughout the day regardless of sleep length, diet, exercise, and even with the help of stimulants like caffeine or Rx Vyvanse",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12px97z,True,Dig-a-tall-Monster,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12px97z/i_33m_get_waves_of_fatigue_throughout_the_day/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12px97z/i_33m_get_waves_of_fatigue_throughout_the_day/,475547,1681766357,0,,False,1681766369,1681766369,2023-04-17 21:19:17,,,

I have this pain and stiffness that comes and goes around my neck for a little over a month. It changes positions regularly. Sometimes it's around the base where the collarbone connects, and sometimes it's higher up. It can hurt to sing or swallow depending on the day - not like a sore throat, but like a nerve or muscular sensation. It just appeared and I assumed it was swollen lymph nodes or something that would go away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently had an MRI of the head and neck and they were clear (a few months before this symptom appeared). I had my thyroid checked as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I have are ibuprofen, muscle relaxers, and a month's supply of prednisone to combat it but I feel like this isn't normal? Is there a test I should be asking my doctors for? I've had tight shoulder muscles/neck before but never bizarre neck pain like this. The only thing that preceded these symptoms were my newest covid booster, but I feel like an overreactive immune response would have subsided in a month? That's what my primary care is banking on for right now at least.

I read a lot of food allergy related content (FARE, SnackSafely, etc...), because of my son's (15M, 5'10, 145, otherwise fit and healthy) severe food allergies. And there was a story about an 18 year old who had eaten a piece of bruschetta that had been contaminated somehow with something nut-related.

The girl realized it almost immediately after swallowing it, as she began to experience reactive symptoms quite quickly. She had her EpiPen with her, which saved her life, but her first response was to attempt to induce vomiting.

I understand the logic behind it, get the offending allergen out of your system as soon as possible, but would that actually do any good? And could it potentially even do more harm? I imagine that attempting to induce vomiting while your lips are swelling and your throat is starting to close up could cause more problems than it solves. But what about if you become aware of having consumed something, and act to induce vomiting before symptoms manifest themselves?

it doesn’t hurt, isn’t hot or pudding. but it seems to have got some lines coming off of it that have me worried. yesterday it was just the main circular center. i had put a bandaid on it overnight.

Up until last year, I was happy and healthy.  I have a history of the aforementioned mental problems, but I was managing them well.  Then, I got sick.  I was never diagnosed with an exact cause other than anxiety, but the suspicion is some kind of long covid, possibly combined with withdrawal from the St. John’s Wort that I stopped taking at the time.  The anxiety caused from this is ruining my life, and I don’t know what to do.  A lot of it stems from the fact that my biology is not in the average range.  I come from a family of athletes, and despite not working out very much, I am able to be quite physically fit.  This extends to my vitals, which has been causing me a lot of distress.  For example, my heart rate goes down to the low 40s while sleeping (resting is around 50 during the day), and my BP will approach 100/60.  This is on brand for the rest of my family.  While I know these are technically just within the normal range, I am absolutely terrified of them.  The rest of my family sees these as a blessing, but I want nothing more than to just be normal, because then maybe I could stop worrying.  The only time I have ever fainted is after a drug reaction post wisdom-teeth removal, but nonetheless it still consumes me.  Unfortunately, this is only one side of my health anxiety.  As doctors couldn’t really figure out anything wrong with me when I was sick other than anxiety despite several doctors/hospital visits, extensive blood work, blood pressure measurements, and ECGs, I took it upon myself to research and try and figure out what’s wrong with me.  I am aware of far more medical things that can happen then most people, and for me that’s a big problem.  Before I kind of just lived in blissful ignorance, but I can’t unlearn what I now know.  I feel like other people have this ability to just say something is so unlikely it’s impossible, but I don’t understand that, because if it happens to other people of course it’s possible.  It’s like I can’t determine what I should and shouldn’t be concerned about anymore.  ‘Oh I feel lightheaded, is that because I’m worrying about fainting or is it ‘real’?  I should assume it’s real because that’s less risky.’  One solution would be to go the doctor whenever I have a concern, but yet another issue is that I’m fucking terrified of doctors and hospitals.  I feel like I’m having to decide between risking something killing me, or living in mental agony going to medical appointment after medical appointment.  I am also trying to study for final exams at the moment, and function well enough to keep my dream job.  I saw a psychologist for a little bit of time last summer, but I didn’t improve much as I find it really difficult to open up to people about what I’m actually going through.  I think it’s a protection mechanism to try to keep myself ‘well-liked’, maybe because of the social anxiety.  Life is just so fucking scary, and I don’t know what to do anymore, living knowing at any moment there is a possibility I’ll have a medical emergency.  Sorry for the long post, I just needed somewhere to gather my thoughts, and if anyone has any advice or has gone through something similar I’d really appreciate it.

It doesn't itch or burn, but it just won't go away. My health anxiety has me convinced that I have skin cancer. Does anyone have an opinion on what they think this looks like?

972,AskDocs,"I’m an 18-year-old female, I’ve had mild migraines with visual aura since I was about 12 years old. I got the Kyleena IUD placed in August of 2022. I have no significant health problems. 

In July of 2022 I experienced what a neurologist called “ataxia” where I lost function on the right side of my body for about 10 minutes after I stood up. I was unable to walk in a straight line so I laid on the couch for 2 hours with the worst nausea I’ve ever felt. I hadn’t experienced anything like this in my life, and this event is ultimately what triggered my concern. 

Ever since the ataxia, I’ve had issues with my bladder—reduced output, increased urge to urinate, and hesitancy that has subsided for the most part but was very noticeable for a couple of months after. It’s possible the two are unrelated but the timing seems more than coincidental (I also tested for UTI which came back clear).

In addition to this, I constantly feel like I’m near fainting when I stand up. My vision goes black, my legs go weak, and my head feels so pressurized. It was the worst right after the ataxia. I also experienced vertigo on multiple occasions, which has since mostly improved. 

I also notice my limbs falling asleep more quickly than usual, which leads to an annoying tingling sensation. Even when I was applying hardly any pressure they would start tingling. 

My muscles have been twitching more than ever—in the most random places, but most of all my stomach and pelvic region.

I saw a neurologist in October who ran tests on me for things like Lyme disease, Lupus, and mono (which I did test positive for at the time (Ebb Vca Igg Ab)). 

He ran a brain MRI and found “multifocal punctuate” lesions, which I will try to attach a picture of. He ran cervical and thoracic spinal MRIs as well which came back clear. 

I understand these are a lot of random symptoms that may just be coincidental, but I’m honestly worried about the possibility of MS, which my uncle suffers from. It seems like all of these weird symptoms followed the ataxia, and maybe they are related to migraines, but they’ve always happened rarely (every 1-2 months) and been fairly mild and hardly debilitating like the ataxia was.

979,AskDocs,"Hi there,

Some background: F (32), 5’3, 153lbs. 2.5 months of constant, dull discomfort in left side of stomach, up towards ribs. Never had any health issues before this. Never smoked, drink very rarely and if I do, 1-2 drinks max. Last time I had a drink was prob new years. Definitely don’t have a perfect diet. My biggest weakness is drinking a lot of Coke Zero, I’ve cut down a lot in the last few months and replaced with water.

It started very suddenly. A few days before the abdominal pain started, I experienced UTI symptoms and frequent urination. Then it went away and shortly after that, I started to feel a mild discomfort on the left side of my stomach. The frequent urination came back, so I went to urgent care and they did a urine test that they said showed very little infection &amp; traces of blood (not visible). They prescribed UTI antibiotics and sent the urine for testing. The result came back as no UTI, but the frequent urination symptoms went away with the antibiotics.

The discomfort in my stomach has stayed. It kind of “travels” around on the left side, sometimes towards right side, but mostly stays on the left side and sometime goes up under my ribs. I’ve also started to have some left side back pain that travels around too every now and then since this started (sometimes shoulder, sometimes further down under back ribs) which has honestly been more painful than the actual abdominal pain. The abdominal “pain” is not really painful, mostly annoying, and I would probably describe it as muscle cramp or burning feeling sometimes. Not sure how to best describe it. 

I did a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound, and nothing was abnormal. I did have tendencies of PCOS, which I already knew. I did basic metabolic panel, CBC, Hepatic function panel, celiac disease comprehensive panel, h pylori breath test and C-reactive protein. Nothing came back abnormal, everything was within normal range.

I’ve also done a CT scan last, which I have a follow up appointment on in 2 weeks from now. I feel like I’m going crazy not knowing what is wrong with me.

I have multiple health issues, but rn my main concern is I've had saddle pain for several years. It increase after a fall nearly 6 weeks ago. I have a labral tear in R hip, so I have been using my L side more to lean or get up on bed.

Neurosurgeon ordered cervical, thoracic &amp; lumbar MRIs last year. I have adult degenerative scoliosis, every disk is bulging, there's rotation at each part of S curve.

I asked for SI MRI, but they said they don't deal with that, ask PCP. I thought that WAS part of spine, but ok.

Anyway, this nerve pain is from lumbar down under my L cheek, across top of leg, to like inner thigh, near groin area, near underwear sits. (No tight fitting clothing there.)

If I sit on the toilet more than a minute,  the L leg falls asleep n I have to be careful not to fall over getting up. 

There has never been anything on my skin around there. No sores, bumps, etc.

A week or so ago the pain got very bad and I looked in mirror and had like a dime size... wound. I treated with peroxide &amp; neosporin several times and it cleared.  But the nerve pain is getting unbearable. I made sure there was nonetheless open skin.

I rarely leave the house, as I don't drive. Idk if it could have been a pressure or bed sore. 

I didn't find anything about nerve pain causing sores. I know shingles has nerve pain, but this was one incident of something open on my body without injury.

I don't have any STI/STD. Haven't even done the deed since NYE 2022.

I am scheduled to see my pcp as I'm having more pain in thoracic area where syrinx is, lumbar/sacroiliac area and a lot more nerve zings and pain  that grabs n stops me in my tracks, at L neck and shoulder. 

I'm also having circulation issues on L. I have Raynaud's, but there has been a noticeable change in purple toes on L and colder temp, more veins coming to surfaces at goot/ankle n partway up calf. (Like a cirle of spider veins branching out.) 

I just don't know if it's possible inside pain can express itself out outer layer of skin?

Sex: ftm

Race: white/hispanic 

Medications and conditions: Bipolar, gastroparesis, PTSD, arthritis, anxiety. I take zoloft, metoclopramide, gabapentin, and recently, in place of abilify, saphris.

I was really, really excited to try saphris as it absorbs sublingually rather than in the digestive tract and as I vomit a lot with my gastroparesis, it seems like THE move. Because my abilify wasn't reliably staying down and I was still having symptoms. On saphris, I feel much better consistently. 

However, I have begun to produce milk. 

I worried about this as I actually lactated on the metoclopramide and it only stopped when I started the abilify. 

I was curious if it would be safe to take a small dose of abilify with my saphris to prevent the lactation (after discussing with my doc ofc- I'm not going off road lol). Is that something I could suggest when I meet with my psychiatrist soon? Or would that be a no-go? 

This is incredibly distressing for me as a trans dude as I don't want tiddies at all, let alone ones that are literally making milk. 

I appreciate any feedback and suggestions. I NEED this med to work out because nothing else will absorb properly with my gut issues.

Hi! I’m so ashamed to ask this and I’m so sorry for the people who have to read this, but I was sitting on the toilet and had to do the „big“ business. I was pushing and it felt wrong, my vagina started to hurt. It felt weird, so I took my phone that I already had with me and decided to open the camera, I was shocked to see that poop was coming out of my private part. I thought I must be going crazy, so I obviously cleaned it with wet wipes and to my shock, I was now 100% sure that it came out of the wrong hole. I don’t know what to do and I’m a little bit scared because it feels like I pushed too hard because it also feels like my vagina is more open than it should be.

Hi I posted a question earlier but that was for another health condition (rhinitis/polyps)

For the past 3 months I have had throat irritation (voluntary cough), dry raspy sensation in my throat and occasional tight chest (which was scary I thought my airways were closing). My gp gave me omeprazole to try which has helped a little

I had a barium swallow recently which revealed oesophageal dysmotility I was told mainly in the lower part of the oesophagus. 

I have been referred to gastroenterology however I have a 3-4 month wait. I am a bit worried in the meantime as I have also had other symptoms (livesoreticularis in my hands/arms 5 times at work). I googled and scleroderma came up. 

I find it difficult to get much useful info online on the causes of dysmotility so just wondered what are some likely causes? How common is it? What tends to be the prognosis?  My symptoms did occur after a period of stress if that makes any difference

998,AskDocs,"EXAM: ULTRASOUND BILATERAL BREASTS

HISTORY: History of follow-up for probably benign left breast mass with new area of tingling and possible indentation left breast and small palpable finding medial right breast.

TECHNIQUE: A four-quadrant bilateral breast ultrasound was performed utilizing standard grayscale images with additional Doppler interrogation when appropriate.

COMPARISON: Left breast ultrasound January 2023 and June 2021.

FINDINGS: Sonographic imaging of the right breast demonstrates homogeneous tissue with no significant focal abnormality appreciated. There is no discrete sonographic abnormality in the medial right breast corresponding to an area of palpable concern indicated by the patient. Sonographic imaging of the left breast again demonstrates a 0.5 x 0.9 x 1.0 cm superficial well-defined hypochoic nodule in the approximate 7:00 position, 7 cm from the nipple. This shows no significant change from prior sonograms dating back to June 2021. There is a 0.3 x 0.5 cm well-defined hypochoic nodule appreciated in the left axilla, not previously identified. There is a questionable hypochoic area measuring 0.6 x 1.0 x 1.4 cm in the deep periareolar 3:00 left breast, not previously identified. It is uncertain whether this represents a discrete mass versus area of tissue heterogeneity.

IMPRESSION: 0.5 x 1.0 cm superficial well-defined hypochoic lesion in the 7:00 left breast, unchanged from prior sonograms dating back to June 2021.
A 0.3 x 0.5 cm well-defined hypochoic nodule is appreciated in the left axilla with a questionable 0.6 x 1.4 cm hypochoic area in the deep periareolar 3:00 left breast, not previously identified. 6 month follow-up ultrasound is suggested for these areas.
No significant sonographic abnormality in the right breast corresponding to an area of concern in the medial right breast demonstrated by the patient. Clinical monitoring is recommended for any areas of palpable concern. A progressive palpable abnormality could prompt additional evaluation.

ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS Category 3: Probably benign.

FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up imaging evaluation in 6 months.


This part “There is a questionable hypochoic area measuring 0.6 x 1.0 x 1.4 cm in the deep periareolar 3:00 left breast, not previously identified. It is uncertain whether this represents a discrete mass versus area of tissue heterogeneity.” Freaks me out. I feel like when I lift my arm above my head, my nipple sinks in ever so slightly. The ultrasound tech claims there isn’t anything behind the nipple but what if it’s the “questionable” area. I’m freaked having to wait 6 months to see if there’s a “discrete mass” or regular tissue. What if it’s cancerous and spreads by then? I have a thyroid biopsy coming up so this is yet another thing :’(",t2_50y55w2h,0,Can someone help me understand my ultrasound results?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12pu4rt,True,allofthecoffeeplease,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12pu4rt/can_someone_help_me_understand_my_ultrasound/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12pu4rt/can_someone_help_me_understand_my_ultrasound/,475533,1681760525,0,,False,1681760539,1681760539,2023-04-17 19:42:05,,,
999,AskDocs,"I had a close friend (30M) suddenly go into cardiac arrest and die. He was incredibly healthy, exercised, didn't have any known medical issues, etc. The night before, he began feeling ""weird"" but couldn't say why. Tried to go to bed, woke up a few hours later still feeling really weird. He tried laying on the bathroom floor (I'm guessing to cool off because maybe he felt panicky?).  An autopsy is being done to see what happeened. 

Any time I've heard of someone having a massive heart attack, I've always heard that they said they ""felt weird"" or ""couldn't get comfortable"" starting around 12 hours or so before. Has anyone here ever gone through a similar cardiac event and had the ""weird feeling""? I'm curious what that might feel like? Why does it take so long for people to recognize that it's an emergency?
