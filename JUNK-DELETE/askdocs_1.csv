So I've been having a bit of abdominal discomfort for about 3 days now, and a lack of bowel movements for about 1 day access of to my normal. I'm 90% sure it's caused by the sheer amount of garbage I had to eat the day it started (Greasy food x3 since nothing else is cheap around here and money is tight). There's no extreme pain or fever or nothing like that - and the discomfort even goes away mostly when I'm still (though after I wake up it tends to be present).

&amp;#x200B;

I cut into savings and got myself a bunch of fruit and fiber bars last night, ate 2 bars for dinner alongside a mini PB&amp;J and I plan on running a fruit smoothie for breakfast/lunch today. I could really work on drinking more water so I plan to only drink water until this passes.

&amp;#x200B;

So my main questions are what else should I do, and when should I see a doc about it (what doc would I go to? Urgent care I presume?)

6,AskDocs,"I'd really appreciate some frank and honest guidance on this. My last birth, a very experienced anesthesiologist placed my epidural. It was a very easy experience and worked great. I'm delivering at a different (teaching) hospital this time that is dedicated fully to labor and delivery (Winnie Palmer), and my OB said ordinarily that's handled by CRNAs and sometimes residents there. 

I am VERY nervous about this prospect. I don't want to be an annoying patient, but I really want this done by someone experienced, especially after reading a lot of SNRA / early resident horror stories. I understand that people need to learn, but I am scared, already have back problems from car accidents, and do *not* want to be learned on. I know that sounds really selfish, but that's just how I feel.

Are there any ""reasonable"" parameters I can place or requests I can make to give myself the best shot at a good outcome? Can I ask for ""someone who has done this procedure at least 200+ times""? Should I ask for specific positions, like a boarded anesthesiologist or senior resident?

How can I phrase this to be most likely to have my wishes honored and not be pressured into letting anyone (especially new learners) do it?

Not quite a year ago I had a fairly strong case of Covid that took me out for about a week. I was a football player and once I came back I really struggled with my endurance and breathing. I couldn't last for more than a few plays before I would start wheezing and having really bad shortness of breath. I went to an urgent care doctor about possibly having a sinus infection because I matched the symptoms, she pretty much dismissed me immediately and said it was just allergies because my nose was red (I think). So after about a week of symptoms not improving with taking allergy meds, I saw my pediatrician. She checked me out and without me even bringing it up she told me I had a sinus infection and I also told her about the shortness of breath and wheezing after coming back from covid, so she prescribed me antibiotics for the sinus infection and an inhaler for the shortness of breath. Both the antibiotics and the inhaler seemed to help. Most practices I was able to fully participate,  with only a few breaks on top of the water breaks that everyone received. Once the sinus infection cleared up, I tried to go a few practices without the inhaler and I went right back to wheezing and needing tons of breaks again. So I continued use of the inhaler for the rest of the season. Now, I'm a senior in high school and graduating soon and since football is over I don't do much extremely strenuous so I very rarely use the inhaler. I still notice that sometime I will start wheezing again if I'm playing games like basketball for fun and will have a few puffs of my inhaler. I thought the inhaler only helped people with asthma and I've never been diagnosed. But the inhaler seems to help my symptoms, is it a placebo? Could Covid have given me asthma? Or does the inhaler just help treat post-covid symptoms? Also my inhaler is starting to run low, should I see about getting a refill even if I don't use it too much?",t2_539y9dd8,0,"Doctor gave me an inhaler for sinus infection and post covid symptoms, I have a few questions.",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12u3m5r,True,Lively_Mule,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12u3m5r/doctor_gave_me_an_inhaler_for_sinus_infection_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12u3m5r/doctor_gave_me_an_inhaler_for_sinus_infection_and/,476253,1682087427,0,,False,1682087448,1682087448,2023-04-21 14:30:27,,,

30,AskDocs,"Hello. I (23F) have had problems with my menstrual cycle for years now. In 2019 I went to a gynaecologist who told me I have PCOS and should start taking birth control. He also found and removed a nabothian cyst. After starting this birth control (ethinylestradiol 35) I rapidly gained about 10kg (22lbs), then another 7kg (15lbs) through the three years, got a bit depressed and started craving a lot more sweets but that was it. I continued testing my liver every year and everything is fine.

In February 2023 I started getting skin tags and read that it might be connected to diabetes (I have grandparents with type 2) - I booked an endocrinologist. She told me I might have insulin resistance and that the BC I am taking is too much and a bit out of date. She told me to limit my carbohydrate intake, lose weight, stop taking the BC, start taking myo inositol and call her in two months. I started the diet and have lost 4kg (8.5lbs) in two months. My menstrual cycle came in almost exactly two months of stopping the pill.

41,AskDocs,"Hello! 

For starters, I am 23 years old, 207 lbs, and 5’11” tall. I suffer from seasonal allergies and every year it seems to get worse and worse. I’ve gone through and tried every type of allergy medication (Zyrtec, Claritin, Benadryl, Allegra, Flonase) but they all seem to either not help at all or just help very slightly. For example, sometimes it will just relieve my eye waters whereas I still feel very fatigued and my sinus still flares the same. Are there any other alternatives I can try? I’ve heard of an injection I can take every year that will prevent such symptoms but is that true?


A few important points to list out:

• As a child to a young adolescent, I had asthma due to my allergies and had to carry around an inhaler. 

• I am a college student, my campus is filled with trees and grass and I walk through it every day. I know that it’s common sense that I would be feeling bad by walking through vegetation but I feel like there must be a way to reduce it?

Duration of complaint: 3-6 months

Current medications: lexapro (10mg), vyvanse (40mg)

I’m 38/F and I’ve had unexplained, abnormal, pretty extreme exhaustion for the last few months. I’m struggling to make it through the day without absolutely needing a nap, which is very unlike me. If I do anything that involves walking around, running errands, or anything that’s not just relaxing, I’m full-body exhausted for a few days.

I drink *maybe* half a beer a week. I do take anti-anxiety meds as well as vyvanse for my ADHD.

My doctor agreed to run a bunch of blood work for me which I had done yesterday (10 vials). Not all is in yet (I don’t think?), but so far abnormalities are:
- AST: 39
- hepatitis b, surface ab, qualitative: reactive
- EBV EBNA igg: &gt;8.0 (AI)
- EBV VCA igg: 2.7 (AI)

I know my doctor will get back to me, but I imagine she’ll wait until everything is in. Given it’s a Friday, I really don’t want to spend my weekend neurotically googling how bad this might be or what it is. My anxiety is already starting to get high.

53,AskDocs,"I'll make the story as short as possible.
My little brother called me yesterday after 72h of not sleeping. 
He was in a panic, trembling, incoherent, too tired to answer any questions fully. 
I am a very calm, reassuring presence in his life so he felt the need to call me. Which is great.

Since then, it's been almost an additional 24h that I am with him and he has slept a total of 2 minutes. 
I've had to reassure him every minute that he wasn't going to die, that there is no danger. His body is getting jerky movements every 15 or so minutes. He repeats the same things over and over again.

All this started because he is about to be a dad for the first time on May 1st. I think he has never processed the fact that it was 'real'. 

I've been by his sides, reading him stories, talking in a calm voice. He almost gets to the sleep state but his body falls asleep before his mind does. Laying, when he is close to sleep he gets those jerky electric shocks all through his body and then he wakes up panicking again. I've had to repeat this cycle over 10 times and never succeed in making him fall into a deep state of sleep.

I called 811 (emergency line here in Quebec). They told me the hospital won't be able to do much...except give him a strong sedative but that would be after 12h+ of waiting in the emergency room since he won't be considered a high priority case. That's how our health system works here. It's not great.
So I see no use in going to the emergency and making him wait that long in a state of pure panic and delusion. 

I tried giving him a sleeping pill of my own (zoplicon). It did nothing. He fights through it. It only worsened his state of delusion and transformed him into a walking incoherent mess.

For sure he needs to sleep. Badly. He also needs to process his emotions (becoming a dad to an unplanned baby in a very delicate time in his life). But he can't process anything in his current state.

I forced him to eat a toast and made him drink lots of water and electrolytes. I told myself that at least I could make sure his body was well hydrated and fed. He won't eat more than that. He just stairs into the void and I have to almost forcefully feed him. 

I don't know what measures to take... I am beginning to be drained myself mentally and physically since I've been staying up and watching him these last 24h. 

He complains about his heart, arms, strange sensations but I keep on telling him it's just that his body needs sleep.

Will his body eventually...win the battle over his mind and eventually shut down? Is there a real danger of not sleeping for 80h+? I keep on telling him it'll be fine but secretly I don't know?

62,AskDocs,"For some background, I’m a 35 year old female, relatively healthy, normal BMI, no major health events, I’ve never smoked cigarettes, rarely drink, not taking any medications. 

During my most recent physical (3/23), my practitioner was slightly concerned about my CBC lab results from 2020. At that time, my platelets were low (81  10^3/uL—their standard range is between 140-400  10^3/uL), but all other values were within normal range. 

After the physical, I had my labs drawn and everything was normal with the exception of my platelet count. The platelet count was inconclusive and there was a note stating that they were “unable to give numerical value for the platelet count”. My practitioner messaged me and said that she had never seen this before and advised me to have my labs redone. She also advised the nurse to collect my new sample in a sodium citrate tube. 

I had my labs redrawn last Friday (4/14), and as of yesterday I had not received my results. I typically get these results back in 1-2 days, so I decided to contact my physician’s office. A nurse promptly replied and told me that my blood sample had spoiled before it made it to the main lab for processing, and that I needed to come back to redo the test. 

This morning a woke up to a message in my patient portal from my physician stating that the blood sample did not spoil, and hematology “assumed that there was essentially an abnormality with the sample”.

I’m going back to have my labs redrawn this morning.

So, I come here to ask: is there anything I can do about frequent leg cramps? They started maybe 6 months ago, however it was only like once per week or so. Now it’s almost daily. It seemed like it originally happened on days that I had a lot of coffee. Now it seems like any time I have 1-2 extra cups it happens, and it happens on days I have my normal 1 cup in the morning. 

I’m fairly healthy. 6’2” and 160 pounds. I walk about 4000 steps per day but that’s really my only exercise. 

I have eaten a banana per day since December, 
I thought I wasn’t getting enough potassium. I looked up potassium deficiency and saw that I had a handful of the symptoms. That didn’t resolve anything. I drink a lot of water, at least 6-8 glasses per day. 

They used to feel like they came on if I flexed my leg in a weird way, now that isn’t always the case. Last night I tried to do some sit-ups and my upper calf immediately cramped. Sometimes I wake up with bad cramps in my leg or foot and have to go walk it off (pretty rare). Sometimes just lying on the couch I will get one.

My Mum has been having problems with fluid retention in her abdomen. She was an alcoholic so we think that's what has brought it on.

It started off with her loosing her appetite and being sick all the time. Now her stomach has grown in size and is rock solid. The doctors she's seen said that diruetics wont work because of where the fluid is. (She said something like third level?) She's had an Endoscopy and a Biopsy which came back fine.

She has numbness in her legs and can't walk far without aid. Basically, she is bed bound and from what she's told me, the doctors can't do anything which I don't understand. Surely something can be done?

Some other info about her: she was on antidepressents but isn't anymore (advice from the doctor to give her body a rest). She is now on either antisickness or antacids to help her eat but has started loosing her appetite again.

took .5mg of Xanax 4 hours ago because this sensation gave me a panic attack.

This sensation has come and gone for about a week now, but each time it usually goes away after 30 minutes or so. Right now it has been 8 hours nonstop and seems to be getting worse.

I have been getting headaches more frequently but I don’t have one now. I feel a bit spacy but that could be due to the Xanax 

I don’t really have any other symptoms except for some nausea and anxiety that was relieved by the Xanax, and I can see clearly, but my vision/eyes just feel funny. I don’t know how to describe it.

I’ll add that this sensation has happened to me in the past over the past couple years and I’ve always associated it with anxiety, because usually the Xanax makes it go away. (Tbh idk if it actually ever went away or if I just didn’t notice) However, today it almost feels worse after taking the Xanax.",t2_g7mm0oz,0,"Earthquake sensation for the past 8 hours straight, should I go the the ER?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,This user has not yet been verified.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12u0ag7,True,I_Eat_Raw_Plantains,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12u0ag7/earthquake_sensation_for_the_past_8_hours/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12u0ag7/earthquake_sensation_for_the_past_8_hours/,476239,1682080438,0,,False,1682080456,1682080457,2023-04-21 12:33:58,,,

Had a hairline fracture on my left elbow 6 weeks ago, been out of splint/cast for about a week now, was told to start my own physio therapy at home.

Things have been going well so far as I have been able to straighten my elbow but not to elbow hyper extension range yet with barely any pain,

&amp;#x200B;

However recently when I am beginning my rehab workout, when bending or extending my elbow, I feel slightly painful ""pops"" or ""cracks"" , in my elbow, similar feeling as when one cracks their knuckles, only that it was slightly painful when it ""cracks"".

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, i just got back from the hospital for a check up and wanted some opinions and experience from people having this.

Last month i had a duodenal ulcer, which opened to a vein. I woke up in the morning, pooped night sky black and proceeded to sweat and vomit blood.

Went to the ER shortly after, they took me in and did a endoscopy? (The camera down your throat) to seal the ulcer. Hospitalized for 5 days and they put me on anti h pilory medicine. On the 4th day they did an ultrasound and found a 0.4cm polyp in my gallbladder, they asked me to come back for a check up today, the doctor gave me 2 options, remove my gallbladder all together or come back every year for an ultrasound and if it reaches 1cm remove the gallbladder.

He also advised me to stop smoking entirely (i am a heavy smoker), no spicy food (i am half thai and eat it everyday) as well as alcohol (thankfully i dont drink much). And this for at least 6 months.

Would really appreciate someone with good cervical spine knowledge who can cast an eye on my MRI and give some input. 

I've been suffering with right side upper back pain and referred pain down the right arm for almost 6 years on and off.  This gets much worse after exercise and abates with rest after a few days. Text book nerve root compression symptoms such as coldness in the arm, tricep spasms and pain in upper back muscles and referred down the right arm.  

Was expecting to see disc herniation/bulge in MRI but the consultant says my scan is entirely normal and it's not disc related. He cannot advise any further treatment apart from long term meds, it's ruining my life now however, tired of the pain, and i really need to get to the bottom of it and sort it if i can.

I can't seem to find a definite answer online. I appreciate your help!

Primary complaint

Frequently returning chest pains on left side of torso  
Frequent pains in left arm, sometimes cold or warm feeling, sometimes numb feeling in fingers  
Sometimes heartbeat is felt very clearly on his head  
Has had one or two 'episodes' where panic sets in and loses vision alongside the previously mentioned symptoms  


Duration: 4 years  


Smokes about 12-15 cigs a day  
Takes no meds currently  
Doesn't drink  


Has had an umbrella procedure done when he was 16, recently confirmed to have fully healed by cardiologist, as well as a healthy heart.  


Has had an MRI, CT scans, an echoes, his shoulders have been checked, neck, head, chest, back, no doctors have found anything. Recently gone to a neurologist that just tapped him on the arm and legs slightly, waved her finger in his face and charged him 70 bucks with nothing found, of course.  


My brother constantly walks around incredibly stressed because of this amongst other things, also has psoriasis which only worsens because of the smoking. Eats pretty regularly but tends to sometimes skip a meal.   


He's had some sort of (panic?) attack driving on the way home, loss of vision with the weird feeling in his left arm, got to the side of the road and called the ambulance, when they arrived they cleared him, nothing wrong. Took him with them to the ER just to be safe, spent another 3 hours on monitoring for his heart and other reactions, he just slept the entire time, nothing wrong.

Does an IT deskjob for a living, at home usually just hangs out on the living room on the couch.   


Golfs sometimes, doesn't do any extreme sports, is pretty lean.

106,AskDocs,"Hello! I will start with some context. 23F, ocasional smoker for 3 years, gave up a month ago, generally healthy, on birth control (combined) since december in order to treat some ovaries cysts. Had covid (the 3rd time) almost 3 weeks ago.

Since the beggining of this week, but more noticeable yesterday and today, I started to experience a very weird general feeling, like weakness, kinda dizzy, heavy headed somehow. But its not been permanent until today, it used to come and go. I also got some very short sharp pain very very similar to the migraine pain, but it didn't persist.

The first thing I suspected is the BC.  I used to have migraines with aura from time to time, family legacy. My doctor proposed I just try these pills, and if I'm feeling bad, we change them. I was very scared, but the thing is, I felt very good until now. No migraines at all, not even the sensation of a migraine, I used to have one once every few months before. Better skin, perfectly timed periods, energy, no fatigue. Until now. I also suspected it was the combination on this with Covid? This being the next subject.

I got covid 3 weeks ago, it was like a bad sinusitis. I felt like i had this sensation while sick, too. Never had it before. Is it possible to be some sort of long covid, or I got reinfected? I don't know what to do anymore. I also have a very stuffed nose even today, and I thoight maybe the sinus problems were not fixed. Can this come from a badly treated sinusitis?

116,AskDocs,"Unexplained upper left back pain [F25]

Hello, very much hoping a kind person or two may be able to provide an opinion. 
F25, 5’4, 120lb
Active (weightlifting/pole fitness/running) generally work out 4-7 times a week. 
Regular smoker, occasional drinker 


Last Thursday, I started feeling a pain around my upper left back, though for the first day or two I thought it may have been heart pain as was radiating around. I’m fairly sure it is my back now, though. I have had no injury I’m aware of, the last time I trained upper body before the pain was Tuesday and all was fine Wednesday. Since then, I have taken days off all exercise, used ibuprofen &amp; paracetamol, ice packs, Epsom salts, foam rollers. Whilst this provides temp relief, it hasn’t felt like it’s improving day by day. The pain doesn’t actually feel muscular- I’ve been through every back stretch, every ROM, and nothing triggers it or makes it worse.

So I have been coming to conflicting answers online. Some say you can't feel your lymph nodes unless they are swollen or its normal to feel them. I am worried about my lymph nodes, only the ones below my ear in the neck area. I only noticed them when I did an self exam with my fingers otherwise I would have not noticed them. I can feel all of it when I stretch my neck the opposite way and feel it out. I don't know if they are moveable but my finger can move pretty easily around it so I don't know. 

I saw someone at urgent care and they said they were swollen a bit and checked my ears and apparently I have a ear infection. I always have ear infections so I wasn't satisfied with the answer. I never really paid attention to my lymph nodes until now because I am paranoid of a HIV exposure. I have finished PEP since like 36 days now and I am worried if I am seroconverting. I did have night sweats for last two nights but it was not much at all, just the top of my tanktop being a bit wet around the neck. Its normal for me to have night sweats I think but idk if its unfortunate timing. I dont have a fever or have felt any unusual symptoms.

Hello docs,

I had a MRI Arthogram done on my shoulder suspecting something going on with my labrum, because I'm having severe front shoulder pain right where my pec meets the humerus under the collarbone, its been there for 2 years now, my doctor says it will take 2 weeks before I get my report, so I thought maybe one of you docs could take a look and see if there is something out of the ordinary. Would appreciate it a lot. I did physiotherapy for like 1 year now and nothing is helping..

Hi, I've lost weight roughly 8 months ago and it never came back. 

I was at 80, now at 65. I think it's mostly muscles that disappeared all of a sudden.

I'm eating quite a lot, I mean in quantities that would normally make me gain weight.

I have a hard time picking up heavy stuff, anything that requires muscle force I just barely handle. It wasn't like that a year ago.

Now I've seen countless doctors in all form of specialty and came back empty handed.

The quiz :

What could possibly make you lose weight/muscle all of a sudden, won't let you gain weight anymore and is not easily identified by health professionals ?

23F. As title says, I'm constantly clogged up in the nostrils. It makes me sound awful, I can barely EVER breathe through my nose (I've been a mouth breather for years and only just realised). I'm constantly hacking something up from the back of my throat but no matter how much I cough out, 30 min later more is back. It messes up my speaking, my breathing, and my exercise! I am not very active, and am overweight, but I'm trying to bicycle for commute to slowly improve this.

I've always had a runny nose since I was a kid, as far as I remember. No food allergies that I know of. 

I do have awful reactions when pollen count is high, and I've tried keeping tabs on pollen count when my nose is clogged beyond belief, and it mostly tracks. Sometimes i do have allergy symptoms with low pollen count though. I do believe this contributes to my mucous overproduction. Occasionally I get itches so badly in my legs for no apparent reason no matter how much I change sheets, hoover, etc.... And lately I've been sneezing nonstop. I can sneeze 10 times in a single burst and start again not even a minute later. I don't know how much exactly this contributes to the constantly clogged nose, but it exists in the absence of and alongside my allergy symptoms, so who knows.

A humidifier and air purifier combo seems to help to some extent. I'm not entirely cleared up when I wake up after running them through the night. But it's much more bearable than waking up without it.

I'm miserable because of this. I know people can think it's gross, and it doesn't help my self perception especially with my physical appearance/health.

I'm in the bay area. Maybe this might be helpful information since I recently went to Tampa and found that my allergies and nose weren't as bad as when I returned. And I did read that there have been bad conditions for allergies in the Bay Area lately. My sinus and allergy issues weren't totally alleviated in Tampa either but they were better to some degree.

I do have exercise induced asthma. Other medical info if it helps at all: on Adderall for ADHD, Sertraline and Wellbutrin, testosterone HRT. I take vitamin D every day and a whole lot of generic brand allergy medication which helps to some degree if I'm having some particularly bad allergies. Never benadryl, it knocks me out.

I should note that I have Medi-Cal (California's low income free healthcare) so my options may be limited in terms of what I can do for seeing a professional/diagnosis/treatment.

I don't know if this information is all helpful or more clutter than anything. I tried not to leave anything out that might be related. but if even one of these things is addressed, whether or not it helps the other issues, I feel like my quality of life would go up :(",t2_1774d9x,0,My nose is constantly clogged and there is always phlegm in my throat,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tw19s,True,keian_nr,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tw19s/my_nose_is_constantly_clogged_and_there_is_always/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tw19s/my_nose_is_constantly_clogged_and_there_is_always/,476227,1682069182,0,,False,1682069196,1682069196,2023-04-21 09:26:22,,,

Description: This morning I woke up with a square-ish rash, around 2x2in., right above my rear left butt. It's very wrinkly, red, with gray in the middle. Texture feels like a scab, very dry. On waking up it felt WARM(ish), stung to touch, was very mildly itchy. It was NOT tender and had no pain when pressed. I took a shower to clean it up, ignoring the stinging, and went about my way.

Tonight it is remarkably less itchy and sting-y but it is still warm. If I think about it I notice it's there. I'm not sure if it's actually a rash or if it was maybe a bug bite. Online searches have been unexpectedly unhelpful.

No other similar rashes are showing anywhere else on my body.

132,AskDocs,"As a fit 18-year-old male, I believe I may be suffering from a condition called anhidrosis. I have experienced this since I was 12, but not as severe as it is now. It initially started on my forehead, and when exposed to hot temperatures, I developed a rash that feels like hundreds of needles poking my skin and will only stop if my body cools down. It has gradually spread throughout my body, like my face, neck, chest, back, and arms. It is triggered by physical overexertion, anger, nervousness, shock, exposure to hot air, and something that normally makes people sweat. 

The only effective treatment I have found is to spray myself with water, eat ice cream, take cold showers, stay in air-conditioned areas, and an electric fan. My mother suggests exercising or going for walks or jogging for x minutes in the hot sun, but the pain and discomfort are TOO much for me to bear, so I always refuse.

135,AskDocs,"To start: I am a 37f non-smoker, and take the following; Azelastine nasal spray, Allegra, Pepcid, Prevacid, twice daily budesonide and xopenex nebulizers, nuvigil, and Xywav. (The last 2 meds are for narcolepsy and the xywav was started AFTER this all began, so I know it is unrelated). Other than narcolepsy my only other issues are allergies, asthma, and GERD. 

I have been having worsening asthma issues, especially the last few years, despite daily antihistamines and asthma meds. My blood work to check eosinophils has continually come back too low to qualify for the eosinophil-targeted biologics (I see a pulmonologist). I also recently went to an allergist and had RAST testing for allergies due to being unable to go off antihistamines. EVERYTHING came back negative, even things that I tested positive for with previous skin allergy testing in 2013 through another allergist (who retired). Even the general IgE level on the test was only 14. 
I was on a 9 day prednisone taper (30mg x 3 days, 20mg x 3 days, 10mg x 3 days) that ended the day before I had the bloodwork done which I did mention to the ENT/allergist. 

Can the prednisone cause false negatives? If not, why am I having allergy symptoms but no allergies and a low eosinophil count in blood work? My lung function, in particular my DLCO, is dropping at a dramatic rate with no explanation(35% in less than 2 years). I have not had Covid that I am aware of. Chest x-ray was also normal.

I’m struggling with health issues and I’ve moved to a new town for school and can’t find a doctor. The ones I’ve been able to see so far are making me feel unheard. I believe COVID reacted my Epstein Barr Virus but my neurologist won’t test me for reactivation because “he can’t order labs that he has no use for.” So I went to the ER to try and they gave me a mono spot which wasn’t the proper test for reactivation. I’ve been having scary cognitive problems with word finding and memory, numbness and tingling in my hands, feet, and legs. Ended up in the ER because I couldn’t write with a pen in class. Even my tongue and lips get tingly and twitch. Bad head ache and back ache. Twitches EVERYWHERE. Brain MRI was clear. Right now my CBC shows 3.1 absolute lymphs. And a 1:1 neut/lymph ratios. I have a small mass on my jaw bone that has increased in size and had a weird ulcer in my mouth. My biggest concerns: MS or Lymphoma since they’re associated with chronic EBV.

This started about 5 6 years ago, when I first got the urticaria. I went to my dermatologist and she confirmed that it is indeed urticaria, but she wasn't sure what caused it. She then put me on a diet which I only managed to follow for 1 day, but didn't have to continue anyway since it disappeared after about 24 hours.

And since then, every time I got sick I would get urticaria. It doesn't itch nor burn or sting, it just sits there on my neck, chest, back, and abdomen.

3 hours ago I was petting my cat and got a cat hair in my nose that sparked up a sneezing and stuffed up nose . Within 20 minutes it turned into a slightly stuffed nose that would drip about once every 2 seconds non stop . I took a Claritin and plugged my nose with toilet paper ,but the Claritin did not help .

the toilet paper soaked all the way through until the tissue itself began to drip from being too saturated in fluid. 

The fluid is crystal clear ,almost less viscous than water and has no flavor other than occasionally having a very ,very mild salty flavor.

 it does not leave a residual crust or layer when it dries on my hands or forearm and the toilet paper I have been using to plug my nose has not dried even slightly 40+ minutes after being taken out. I have no other symptoms of CSF leak other than the nature of the fluid itself and a slight queasyness when I swallow too much of the fluid. The drip slows and goes down the back of my throat when laying down and immediately speeds up when I sit or stand up . Keep in mind I have not experienced so much as a bump on the head within the past 3 years although I had an extended episode of stress and anger over the course of two hours ,that ended 6 hours before the drip started.

161,AskDocs,"So, I got diagnosed with dysautonomia and I’m undiagnosed with either hyper or hypo* parathyroidism.

About a year ago, I started to have not so much as panic attacks (because at some point, I wasn’t panicking, but I did feel like something was wrong) but anxiety attacks.

I had 6 trips to the ER complaining with chest pain, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. That was before I ever googled my symptoms. So, of course, my first thought was, “I could be having a heart attack even though I’m 25 years old because I’m not a doctor and I don’t know that it’s extremely rare for a 25-year-old woman to have a heart attack.”

So, in my 6th. visit to the ER, they finally wanted to give a follow-up just to check that everything was alright with me. They got some bloodwork and they did the tilt table test on me which came back positive, and they took me a gammagram which came back negative.

Basically, they said, “Take this beta-blocker and control your anxiety.”

Then I paid a visit to another endocrinologist and she told me that gammagrams are not it. You can have a thyroid or parathyroid imbalance even if your gammagram doesn’t show a tumor. I had two blood tests which showed the parathyroid out of range, elevated. Even when my gammagram was negative.

They never told me how my dysautonomia works, if I’m purely OH or if I have POTS. 

Unfortunately, my dysautonomia hit harder during the time and I had to spend all my money in echocardiograms and ECGs just to make sure I was alright. Because palpitations in the neck are very scary. Bradycardia every night is scary. Tachycardia and dizziness when standing up is scary as well.

Anyhow, I wasn’t able to follow my treatment with that endocrinologist who did care. And I paid a 7th. visit to the ER because one day, out of the blue, I couldn’t breathe, my temperature was 100 °F, my oxygen levels were 85%, and I had tachycardia while laying down.

I had an odd BP event. I was at 146/126 (I have dysautonomia; I had never ever reached those numbers) before arriving to the hospital and then I was 70/50 when laying down in the hospital bed. They said, “Oh, well, maybe your BP is naturally low.”

It’s not, doc. That’s why I got dysautonomia. 

I mentioned the parathyroid again, but when they saw my ECG and my electrolyte levels in balance, they discharged me. Oxygen levels at 88%, temperature now in the norm, and still tachycardic.

The resident doctor said, “Well, maybe you’re nervous because you’re in a hospital.”

Sir, I got health anxiety and my RHR is 50 BPM. So if I’m not bradycardic right now is because something’s wrong within my body. You can’t just discharge me like this.

But they did.

And then my recent bloodwork showed I’m high in phosphorus, and what does the phosphorus relate to? Parathyroid. High phosphorus is a sign of hypoparathyroidism, actually. So now I don’t know if it’s hyper or hypo because when I was there at the hospital, they just discharged me with a gammagram.

Anyhow, again I’m focusing on my heart. I know that parathyroidism seems to be my real issue, but… neck palpitations are scary. I need to confirm that my carotid arteries are OK. And I will spend money in paying another visit to my cardiologist. But damn it, I want to tell him, “Doctor, my dysautonomia is real. I live in the function of my HR and maybe I pay too many visits to the ER because when I feel as if my heart was coming out of my chest with terrible palpitations that go from my chest to my neck, I want to make sure that I’m OK. Please stop saying that ‘it’s just my anxiety,’ because even if this is the slightest of processes, even if this is just because for a moment I’m running low in potassium, I want to correct that so I can maybe go back to my normal life. Hell, you didn’t even tell me how does my dysautonomia workds, if it’s POTS or purely OH.”

The thing is, my cardiologist doesn’t really empathize with me and I know it must be frustrating that while he does have patients with end-stage heart failure or real heart attacks, I am there asking if having a PR interval of 120ms or a QTc of 398ms is too short, or like, “Hey, doctor, remember the neck-palpitation episode? Well, just to be sure, it’s alright, right?”

But I cannot just accept the lack of treatment that I’m receiving. I worry about my heart. And my condition does require more reassurance. And he is my only available cardiologist and I don’t live in the States and I don’t have the money or the possibility to go with other doctor.

I live in a country where dysautonomia is basically gaslighted into anxiety. And I need to express my needs as a patient to this people so they can provide me with answers.

170,AskDocs,"I had a mole removed from my toe almost years ago. My doctor then told me that it came out as a bening acral nevus. Out of curiosity I went to read the medical report and I’m anxious that should I still worry about this:

”A 10 mm skin sample from the tip of the left toe of the second toe is examined. It
is completely initiated in three transverse sections. Acanthotic
epidermis with hyperkeratosis on the surface, partly due to the anatomical locations
anatomical features. The retinal ridges are elongated. There are a few
neovascular pockets with slightly reduced cohesiveness. The cells have only
slight variation in shape and size. There is no protrusion into the upper epidermis
evident. A granular cell layer is visible throughout. There is a slight
fibroblasts and collagen strands are visible in the dermis papillae
parallel to each other. There are also some spots of round cells.

The findings are consistent with junctional neovascularisation, and mild atypia is interpreted as
associated with an acral nevus (special site of nevus). Together with
transverse section, the change extends quite close to the edge, with an edge margin of 0.1”

I used DeepL to translate this from Finnish but think that it the terms are quite correct.

I weighed 185lbs 2 months ago, but lack of appetite and nausea made me melt and im still melting. I had low back pain for about 3 weeks that moved to my right hip. No amount of massage helped and it was getting bad. Then I developed urinary symptoms of a UTI. It was bad, I had a fever of 104.3, my pee was horrible smelling, painful, but it wasn't frequent. So I got online to order antibiotics. Used careMed and entered my symptoms. They wouldn't give them to me due to my low back pain and high fever. Well, it was Saturday, I needed them. So I exited the site, went back in and left those out. Boom bactrim. Picked it up from safeway and started taking it. The second day, uti signs were gone but my back pain got worse and my right side was screaming. 
I went to my GP today after 5 of the 7 days on bactrim. She ran my urine and said she found no signs of infection but there was a lot of microscopic blood in my urine. She ordered an urgent ultrasound of my bladder and kidneys. But they'll call me tomorrow or Monday with my blood results and to make an appointment. She told me to finish the bactrim.

181,AskDocs,"F24 (Just turned 23 at time of Vaccine), 170cm, 68kg, previous smoker (now vape), been on desogestrel since 12/21 and occasionally take lorazepam.


I’ve been going back and forth to the doctors since late 2021 due to unexplainable symptoms and have yet to receive a diagnosis or even find anything wrong.

On the 26th of August 2021, I had my first vaccine. Between the 26th and the 2nd of September, I started experience some mild symptoms (nausea, panic attacks, anxiety, loss of appetite, dizziness, etc) but didn’t think too much of it. It continued to get worse and on the 12th, I had a full blown panic attack where I felt so ill I thought I could die. The symptoms started first and I still can’t figure out if it was just a panic attack or if the symptoms that initially started, freaked me out and lead to a panic attack.

By the 20th of September, I was totally housebound. Couldn’t eat, felt unbelievably nauseous 24/7, cried all the time, just felt INCREDIBLY unwell.

Since then I’ve seen therapists, doctors, tried medications, nothings worked. I still suffer with the same symptoms, I’m just somewhat used to them because they’ve been ongoing for a year and a half now.

Myself and everyone else has put it down to anxiety (due to getting panic attacks when out in public - this part is probably anxiety but again, never experienced this intense fear of leaving my house prior to getting the vaccine) but I still just feel ill all the time at home. I keep getting random new symptoms then old ones go away, come back, etc.

Is it possible that I had a bad reaction to the vaccine and it’s caused all of my symptoms? It’s not something I even considered until yesterday when I saw my records and saw the date I got the vaccine.

Within 25 days of getting the vaccine, my life was totally ruined. No sign of ANY of these symptoms before the vaccine. I feel ill and just not like myself and haven’t since then. I don’t know if it’s just a coincidence but we can’t find an issue and if it’s anxiety, it truly came out of nowhere and I can’t think of a reason for it.

I just want an answer and I’m really hoping this is it.

184,AskDocs,"Hello Reddit Viewers,

I'm a 29 year old guy, currently 5""11, 140 Pounds.

In Late 2018 I was experiencing Crazy anxiety and Panic symptoms, along with a pounding chest, fast heartbeat and occasional headaches. The only thing that would help my symptoms were meditation, alcohol, working out and sex/masturbation.

 At one point it got so bad that I went to the emergency room , where they gave me an EKG, handed me some ativan and I was discharged just a few hours later. They stated it was not my heart and to go find a therapist to work with. 

Well therapy provided no help, and 4 months later I started feeling a bit tired, my exercise tolerance started going down a lot. (before all this I was running 3 miles a day, practicing MMA,  biking, surfing, pretty much no physical limitations.)

I went from great physical shape to being very tired, I nearly passed out while driving several times, to being short of breath just sitting in a single place and could barely walk up the stairs to my apartment complex.

I went back to the hospital and they ran a battery of tests, echocardiogram, ekg, chest ct scan, a myriad of blood tests but nothing came back too out of balance. 

My symptoms went from bad to worst. From being able to somewhat function to being housebound. I started analyzing my health records, and noticed on the echocardiogram that they were unable to capture my diastolic function due to being in tachycardia...

Well an acupuncturist, psychiatrist and two cardiologists later and he reads on the echo that I have diastolic dysfunction grade 3. When I mention if its diastolic heart failure he says it's not and prescribes me carvedilol, which honestly does nothing only makes all symptoms worse. Despite my 10 visits with the new cardiologist he tells me to keep staying on the carvedilol despite horrendous symptoms so here is where I begin experimenting and working with a naturopath.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I tried

1) Carvedilol (Doesn't work)

2) Metoprolol (doesn't work)

3) Propranolol (doesn't work, makes things worst)

4) Klonopin ( I'm currently on this, 0.25Mg once a day now it was working very very well especially Initially, lost a bit of effect, but I'm better off on this than without) Would really like to get off of it though. 

5) Magnesium Glycinate (doesn't work if anything made symptoms worst)

6)  Hawthorn berries ( works, although very temporary, and effects started fading out, stopped using)

7)  Vitamin D3 AND K2 ( Helps a bit and I'm currently taking this)

8) Nad+ ( works well, started making my stomach upset so I stopped taking this) I started taking it intravenously but it started getting expensive and takes forever. Also would give me palpitations. 

9) High dose Vitamin C (Was working initially, then effects started wearing off. Still take from time to time.)  too much would give me palpitations but it's better  than other symptoms I'd experience.

10) COQ10 (works well, especially with vitamin C) still take from time to time.

Ever since I was a little kid every time I get a cold or flu, I also experience hay fever/histamine over reaction symptoms in conjunction. This is much more than just normal stuffed up sinuses, rather, it's like I'm having an allergic reaction or mild anaphylaxis to the cold/sickness itself. I don't experience seasonal or food allergies, although, one time I did have an anaphylactic reaction to exposure to black mold and I would say my symptoms then and the symptoms I experience every time I have a cold are exactly the same.

My sinuses get completely blocked and swollen - I can't breathe in or out through my nostrils, nor can I blow my nose. My sinuses don't feel blocked with not snot or phlegm, but rather just feel completely swollen. My nose, face and throat get very sparkly and tingly, and my eyelids and the skin around my eyes also feel like they are swollen with water. My eyes water so much I can't see from them. These symptoms can last last up to 2-3 days sometimes. Decongestants don't help these symptoms, but antihistamines do.

The tingly face sensation and the watery eyes makes having a cold totally unbearable for me, and I would do anything to avoid these symptoms.

I've never heard of anyone else experiencing these types of symptoms, but I'm just wondering why this happens to me or if anyone else has similar experiences too.

Patient deceased with bilateral Pulmonary Thrombo-Emboli. Exploration of the deep calf veins in both legs failed to reveal any deep venous  thromboses. The Thrombo-Emboli (many, currently undefined amount) were in the parenchyma of both lungs and were solid, branched and strongly  adherent to the underlying blood vessels.

There is no evidence of infarction anywhere on the lungs. Post-Mortem describes the individual as healthy in every aspect. Anecdotally the individual was fit, strong and active. There was no clotting anywhere else in the body.

Deceased had recently had ORIF surgery for a broken clavicle 2 weeks prior to death.

Deceased had Pfizer booster 24 hours earlier and showed adverse reaction mere hours later (difficulty breathing, headache) but patient was stubborn and didn't seek initial help.

The fact this post maybe taken down by moderators for simply mentioning the COVID vaccine is blatant propaganda. 

My earlier comments stating I'm unsure if it was the vaccine of the surgery being responsible for his death being removed by moderator is blatant propaganda. Why can we not have discourse? 

I've had physicians tell me definitively it was not the vaccine. How can we be so sure the vaccine is without side effect? To deny the possibility is to deny all history of medical literature. All medication has potential side effects. 

***Before this post is banned, mod, you must read this:*** The booster should not have been administered 2 weeks post clavicle ORIF surgery and is likely the cause of death. Thoughts?

To you reading, I'll likely be banned because of this post. I hope YOU decide the potentials at play in this scenario.

High cholesterol, obesity, Gerd. Takes Pantoprazole in mornings

First occurrence was in 2020. Woke up around 11pm to swollen, itchy hands. Benadryl made things better and thought nothing of it.

2nd occurrence 2021, same things, woke up around midnight with the same issue. Benadryl to the rescue. Diarrhea the rest of that following day. Concerned about potential seasoning-based or food allergies but none ever existed prior to 2020. 

3rd occurrence, 2022, swelling in hands and itching much worse, woke him from a dead sleep around midnight. Horrible diarrhea.  Benadryl again to the rescue.

4th occurrence, happened 2 days ago. He was traveling for work. He woke up at 2am to hands swollen with hives. Intense, mind-blowing itching. He went to get Benadryl from the front desk of hotel and noticed a tickle in his throat. He took two Benadryl and ibuprofen and then spent an hour hacking up liquid from his lungs and wheezing. By 4am he was on the verge of calling 911 due to difficulty breathing when he realized that his hands were starting to de-escalate from the swelling. 30 minutes later and he was breathing better. He felt like shit the past 2 days and has had diarrhea.

I’m so ANGRY that he didn’t call 911. It’s become obvious that he has some sort of growing food allergy. I mean, this sounds like anaphylactic shock, right? It’s super delayed, but the pattern is getting progressively worse. The night this happened, he had eaten shrimp and lobster. I don’t recall what he ate during the previous episodes, but it wasn’t always shrimp related. We were suspicious of maybe Tumeric or some kind of seasoning/spice. Now I’m thinking shellfish?

Is this something that can be addressed by his doctor or does it have to be done through a specialist?

So about 2 years ago I landed on my foot terribly. I've sprained my ankle multiple times in sports but this time was different. When I landed I heard two loud cracks and my foot instantly gave out. I couldn't walk on it for a day and I couldn't move it, when I tried it would just twitch. I never went to the doctor because it was when covid just started spreading and I didn't want to make a big deal if it was just a sprain.

We have a family history of blood clots and aneurysm as well as bleeding disorders. We’ve had family members die from these. 

The doctor at the hospital has done basically no examination aside from her vitals, but is insisting she is too young for it to be a blood clot. He’s offered to do a blood test but refusing to do an ultrasound.

Maybe it is, maybe it’s not. But I feel like she has a right to an ultrasound or further examination to rule it out given our family history. Should she keep pushing for this or is the doctor right by trying to send her home?

I've been having severe heart attack symptoms for weeks now, but the doctors I've talked to all dismissed it due to me being young, having ""no risk factors"", and a normal ECG. But my symptoms keep getting worse, I can't study or even just relax because of the symptoms, and I'm worried that the tests I've taken can't detect an actual heart blockage, and that it may (or has already) lead to permanent damage. 

I wrote this timeline that covers everything that's happened. 
What can I do from here?

# Timeline

## Summary
Chest pain suddenly started on April 1, and multiple heart attack/angina symptoms started appearing in succession throughout the next 2-3 weeks. 

## Current symptoms
Left (sometimes center) chest pain, sometimes spreads to shoulder/back, shortness of breath, unexplained tiredness/fatigue (but no fever), weakness/discomfort/pain in arms/legs, strong heartbeat, occasional headache, occasional jaw numbness/pain

Symptoms alternate, but I always feel at least 2-3 of them at a time
Chest pain is dull, kind of squeezing/heavy, lasts for hours at a time

## Existing conditions
- GERD/Acid reflux
- Asthma

## Tests taken

- Chest X-Ray (April 14)
- CBC (April 20)
- Electrolytes (April 20)
- Troponin I (too late?, taken on April 17)
- All tests came up ""normal""

## Notes
- Currently taking Pantoprazole and Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxide/Simethicone for GERD
- Salmeterol/fluticasone as asthma maintenance inhaler
- Salbumatol as rescue inhaler, but doesn't work even when I use it during shortness of breath
- Chest pain does not get worse during/after meals

## Other
- I've never smoked or did any drugs
- I haven't had alcohol for 1.5 years, and before that I'd only drink once every 1-2 months

2. Diarrhea (pooped 10 times a day)
3. Very gassy and explosive poops. 
4. Spit up.

I did that diet for a week and still no improvement and at that point I gave up and switched him to an elemental formula that seems to be doing OK so far ( 48 hours in).

Hey was just prescribed 2 weeks worth of adderall 10mg XR. Been taking it for 3 days and haven’t felt any difference. I’m thinking tomorrow I’m going to up my dose to 20mg. 

The reasoning behind it is I want to see if a higher dose will not only work but if the experience I’m thinking it will provide is something “life changing”. I figure since I’m new to the medication 20mg should give me a peak experience of the medication. If it’s anything less then “life changing” I don’t see my self asking for a re-up or personally even taking the rest of the prescription. I don’t want to be messing with addictive medication like this for meh results. 

I also don’t want my doctor 2 weeks from now bringing me up to 15mg for example and still not getting the results I want. Then I’m just putting this substance in my body for no reason. 

I feel like I need to do this like a bandaid. Experience the full blown effects of the medication early on so I’m not getting my mind accustomed to the drug without the results. Also so I know if even at a proper dosage if this is something I feel is worth the squeeze. 


So does this sound like an okay idea for one day? I rather take 20mg one day and make my mind up then waste time swallowing 10mg pills that aren’t doing anything.

I never have donated plasma before because I am sexually active and I didn’t want to lie and say I’m not. I also don’t feel comfortable discussing my sexuality with a stranger due to not wanting to face any discrimination. But now for financial reasons, I may lie. But I also feel a little bad.

He doesn’t remember exactly when it started, nor if there was a specific injury that could have caused it. 

Should I be concerned? Is this an issue for his physician, urgent care, hospital? I can tell he’s not as active as he wants to be just because of his pain. He likes playing basketball, but can’t go as often as he would like.

229,AskDocs,"Hi, 25 and 5”0 female here.

Almost 2 weeks ago I had sudden onset of abdominal pain and went to the A&amp;E of a rather inefficient hospital that diagnosed me as appendicitis. I felt like that wasn’t the case so I went to another hospital for a second opinion and they think that it’s a UTI. The first hospital actually tested my urine for leukocytes (2 ++) but then just ignored the test results for whatever reason. Just gave me a bad feeling and that’s why I went for a second opinion.

Anyway, the doctors at the second hospital prescribed me 1 week of antibiotics (cipro) for the UTI. I’ve taken it as instructed to and it’s been about 2-3 days since I completed my course of antibiotics, however today I feel like I had some discomfort urinating. It was like the sensation where you pee and then feel like there’s more to pee out. 

This is my first ever UTI so I’m quite lost. I found it strange that my symptoms just came back - my abdominal pain went away in the middle of my antibiotics course and I had close to no symptoms by the end of it. Is this normal in some patients?

232,AskDocs,"I'm a 24 year old male I'm about 180lbs. I exercise about twice a week. 

For over a year now I've been experiencing muscle numbness, photobia, throat numbness, pins and needles, burning sensations, and unable to feel sexual pleasure. It started with a headache that lasted for a about a day and suddenly like a switch my muscles went numb. This was in fall 2021. A few months before that I started experiencing heart burn and acid reflux so intensely the doctors though I had a heart problem but that was cleared up after going to the cardiologist. I was put on famtodine and that helped. So during the time of this first headache I was taking terbinafine, and I noticed that it made my stomach issues come back. I thought my numbness issues perhaps were cause by terbinafine and the stomachs issues but the doctors didn't seem to think there was a connection.
At this point I would say my muscles were like 70% numb.

With muscle numbness that I currently have I cannot feel when I extert my muscles so when I exercise or lift and can't ""feel the burn"". But I can feel muscles soreness days after working out. 
Also I don't have skin numbness meaning of you poke me I can feel just as normal. This is why I think doctors don't take my symptoms seriously. 
This muscle numbness is a full body numbness by the way. 
There also seems to be no weakness because I could lift as much before in the gym.

Now more recently in 2023 I had another similar headache and now my muscles are like 90% numb. This headache lasted like 4 days and I also had body aches. I felt terrible. 
 

In between both headaches I had seen a neurologist and had labs done. The neurologist didn't seem to be convinced that I had anything. He thought I should see a psychiatrist, he said my symptoms are vague. I also pass the basic neurological examinations where they check balance and strength. My blood work showed that had high levels of B12.

239,AskDocs,"Hi I'm 48F and about 150 lbs, 5ft. 9. I live in Scotland, UK. Medications: pregabalin for anxiety, pantoprazole for my stomach. Conditions: Autism, GAD, hereditary angioedema. I don't drink or smoke. No drugs. 
I've been having a lot of stomach problems for the past few weeks since I had a concussion at the end of February. I've been on lansoprazole for about 6/7 years without issue but started getting a lot of stomach pain so eventually the GP changed me to pantoprazole instead. My stomach started feeling better and I gradually was able to eat more again. However, I noticed that I started getting a lot more heartburn and reflux on this med than the lansoprazole where it hadn't been much of a problem. Then I noticed that I had a couple of little ulcers on my throat but they weren't sore at first. 

After a while my throat started getting quite sore and I went to the doctor last week. She thought it was nothing much, maybe viral but gave me some chlorhexidine mouthwash which hasn't really helped. By Thursday last week it was painful to eat. On Monday I went back and she still didn't think it was much, but agreed to take a swab. This hasn't come back yet from the lab. I went to the dentist yesterday and he thought it was tonsillitis. It is now absolute agony when I eat and I'm quite desperate, I'm in so much pain. 

I was totally fine stomach-wise before my concussion (I got really anxious afterwards as I had got such a fright). My throat was totally fine until a few weeks ago. The throat issue seemed to coincide with when I started taking pantoprazole and has just got worse and worse. I don't smoke but I do vape, no problems with throat in 7 years so I don't think it's that (obviously have cut down just now). I have never had tonsillitis or a throat infection before. But I realise it could be that or maybe a bit of both? My reflux is really bad now. 
I am so miserable that I'm crying every night, I can barely eat, I'm getting the shakes from how upset I am. I'm not coping at all. As I'm autistic this is just too much for me. 

Problem with PPIs- omeprazole and lansoprazole (at high dose) gave me bad anxiety/agitation. Famotidine didn't do anything. Esomeprazole is too similar to omeprazole and rabeprazole is difficult to get (I think I would have to go private to get it which I'm willing to do).

241,AskDocs,"I’m not sure what subreddit to post this to but I’ll start here. 
So a week ago I went on a ride along with this guy who was offering me a job to be a tub refinisher. 
He works by himself and owns the company.
And to be honest I didn’t know the first thing about tub refinishing I just wanted to make decent money. 
I thought this guy was going to be safe/or know his shit because he said he’s been doing this for 20+ years.

He’s hands me a slightly used respirator and tells me it’s fine because he’s only used it once shortly. 
But to my surprise it had tons of white particles inside the mask and the outside of the filters had white crap all over it. 

Before we got to work I tried my best to clean the inside of the mask so it wouldn’t have as much shit on the inside but what I really should’ve done is left at that point because I didn’t know what I know now.

He tells me to come watch him apply this chemical to etch the tub. This takes about 8-20 minutes. The only form of ventilation this guy has for the small bathroom is opening a window and that’s how it is for the rest of the job. No proper ventilation. No fans. 

We leave the room to let it sit and go to his truck to mix some chemicals together unmasked. He makes a primer &amp; the only chemical I can remember of the mixing was some sort of resin. 

After some time we go back to the tub and he rinses off the etching. Next off he tells me to watch him use the primer he mixed with a spray gun. He’s starts to spray &amp; the room gets super cloudy. Even with my mask on I could smell it. It was a horrible smell. And then my eyes started to get irritated. I don’t know why this dumbass didn’t think about using eye protection or mention it to me. From time to time he would take off the gun and spray air pointed at the window to get some of the cloudiness out but it didn’t do much. And I think we were in that room for about 10-15 minutes. 

We go back to his car to mix some paint and I take off my mask to him telling me I have some white streaks on my nose. He tells me that my mask was leaking and to put it on more snug. Why didn’t he show me how to properly wear it in the first place? 

We go back and he applies paint with the gun and I still smelled it slightly but not as bad. And it’s basically the Same story as the primer. 

One tub finished 

We then go to a hotel an hour drives later and he tells me this jobs alittle different and I’ll probably never have to do this task ever. He’s removing someone’s shit job and repainting it so he has to use lacquer thinner. 

He does 3 tubs unmasked so I assume it’s safe without a mask. Still no ventilation. I wasn’t with him the whole time as he wanted me to prep the rooms he was about to work on with paper and tape. But I was probably around him with the lacquer for about a good 30ish mins. 

After all is said and done he pays me 100 dollars under the table for the day.

After some research I’m horrified to find out this guy is a complete moron for not using ventilation for any of the jobs. 

It’s been about a week so far and before the job I was starting to develop a sinus infection before any of this work but after that job I’ve just felt a bit off. 

-kinda of weak/tired a lot of the time 
-coughing alot but that could’ve been the sinus infection 
-just a bit of a general lightheadness that hasn’t really gone away 
-a bit of dizziness from time to time 
-and I just kinda feels weird to move my body. I don’t really know how to explain that one. Maybe it’s apart of the feeling weak. 
-and headache too but that also could be from my sinus as my forehead is very tender from my sinus.
-I’ve had some other symptoms but there are the most bothering. 

I just feel kinda off 

What should I do? 

Did I damage my nervous system or lungs?

251,AskDocs,"31 M, 6’2” 175 lbs USA. Very active, healthy diet and lifestyle. 

Several episodes over a 3 year period where my HR will spike VERY high without explanation. Some examples:

Today. Taking daily Peloton ride and my HR spiked from 155 to 210 in a matter of seconds. This was during a cool down and was not aligned with my level of exertion at all. No other symptoms, but went to urgent care to be safe. My blood pressure was 150/104 and HR remained at roughly 100bpm. The EKG was “normal” per the doctor but he did say there was some sinus arrhythmia when listening to my heart. My HR was going up and down very sporadically.  Ultimately he said this was not detrimental to my healthy and advised following up with a cardiologist. 

6 months ago. Taking a shower and feel my HR beating very fast. Put on my Apple Watch and it was showing 185bpm

2 years ago. Warming up to play tennis and Apple Watch shows 190bpm. I had yet to even break a sweat. 

These episodes don’t come with any other symptoms. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, etc. I wore an event monitor for 30 days and it caught a few events that my PCP believed were SVT, but a cardiologist disagreed and said it was standard tachycardia. 

I’ve had countless EKGs, an echocardiogram, blood work, chest x-rays, etc. All point to a perfect healthy 31 year old. 

The best they can tell me is that there is something going on with the “electrical” element of my heart. They say it’s benign but it’s obviously very disconcerting. 

Any further ideas? What happened today felt different in that my HR has never gone high (210) and the “jumping” from fast to slow has not happened before either.

Healthy (I think) non smoker, non drinker.

Ok so I am terrified. Reason being; a year ago I got diagnosed with anal fissure, the symptoms included small traces of blood when wiping and pain. This only occurred when my stool was pretty wide and to the more constipated density. 

Saw a doctor, it was so painful when she looked but she said she didn’t have to look more since she saw where the bleeding came from. She prescribed something to make my stool softer. Eventually, the fissure seemed to have went away, however as soon as I got constipated it made its appearance. So it’s reoccurring and that scares me. My doctor asked if I’ve been through sexual abuse, which I have and she told me that the trauma sometimes is the reason for the anal fissure.

The summer went on and I felt ok, but then the fall came and I got terrified of having anal cancer. Like so terrified I sat up all night crying, visiting the ER due to stomach cramps, experiencing diarrhea and uneasy feelings. I would get these extreme anxiety attacks, and feeling terrified and certain I’d die. 

I went back to my doctor and she explained to me that my symptoms may be caused by mental health issues. I was so certain I was dying, so she listened and ordered a bunch of tests for me. I was certain I had blood in my stool, so she ordered blood work and to test the feces itself. I did all that, pretty extensively and everything came back normal, I didn’t even have blood in my stool. 

She said that if I’m still worried I could get a colonoscopy, but she didn’t feel like I needed to because the tests would’ve picked up on something. I felt perplexed. Then I tried to just calm my self, surely enough the stomach cramps went away, I didn’t get explosive diarrheas, I didn’t cry all night. 

This was in late march. Now come April, I have bounced back from the worst scares, I’ve also seen a therapist and since I’m diagnosed with OCD there is a bigger risk of me developing hypochondria and such. 

And a few days ago I got constipated, and while at the toilet I had to push, even though you’re not supposed to and I gave birth to a solid, big poop. But it was hurtful it was so wide. The next day, a same poop appeared and then suddenly I felt this little bump in my butt. Like a little knot. And the pain and itch started. Idk if it’s a hemorrhoid, but I am so scared of it being anal cancer :( 

I can’t sleep again and my booty itches so much. Is it possible to have anal fissure and then also hemorrhoids? How do I know if it is cancer? :( should I get a colonoscopy?

I just took 4 pregmate pregnancy test because I was feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and very nauseous. I haven’t quite missed my period yet, but everyone told me to test because it sounded like I was pregnant. I took a test early evening after drinking a lot of liquids, and it was a very very faint positive pink line. 

The next 2 days, I took more test and they all got little darker each time.

I decided to take a clear blue digital test the same time k took the strip test, and the strip test came back positive (darkest line I’ve gotten so far), but the digital said not pregnant. 

I then took another strip test that same night because of the negative digital, and it came back very faint pink (I had just finished drinking a lot of water).

I then took a first response test the next evening, at around 6 or 7pm that was very negative.

263,AskDocs,"19 Female.   It's a bit of a long story but I appreciate all the help or second opinions I can get. 

I began playing wheelchair basketball in January of 2022. I'm able bodied but struggled with POTS too much to really enjoy Stand-up. 

In February I took a hard fall in the chair. I tipped forward with the ball in my hands and slammed my chin on the ball as it hit the ground. I was strapped in so the chair awkwardly followed behind me. I got up fast, embarrassed, but immediately felt nauseous and shaken. I noticed my pupils were two different sizes but this wasn't my first rodeo so I knew to watch for a concussion. 

I started getting bad headaches a couple days later and within two weeks I was losing my vision and hearing during the migraines, feeling like I was gonna throw up, and shaking for hours. I went to a physio place and got a concussion and whiplash diagnosis and I was out of sports and school for a couple weeks. 
I was cleared of concussion symptoms in April except for some minor issues with reading comprehension etc. 

I began working on a farm in June, and a whole new set of symptoms hit me hard. I was having awful neck and shoulder pain, but the worst was the migraines. Horrible pain in the back of my head and my eyes, to the point where even using the bathroom and straining was painful. I was having visual hallucinations during the migraines, and would leave work early several times a week. It got to the point where I was passing out driving, and waking up a couple seconds later, or getting honked at at green light because I'd fallen asleep during the red. 

Neurology put me on a bunch of migraine meds but they didn't help at all. Eventually in September I ended up in the ER for a migraine that lasted hours and had both my hands numb. They did a CT scan (clear), a migraine cocktail that didn't work, and then a Nerve Block into the occipital area which did provide relief. The Neurologist registered me for an MRI. 
The family doctor signed me up for an ultrasound of the upper back and neck. 

I stayed on the farm until September and continued playing wheelchair basketball.  I was mostly worried about the headaches figuring that of course my shoulders would be sore cause I was working hard at basketball. 

The ultrasound tech was horrified. 
Right side: Grade 2 Strain Occipital Attachment (16x2x19mm), Grade 2 Strain Upper mid trapezius base of neck (21x5x18mm) with some partial disruption of fibrils and derangement of fibrils at upper trapezius base of neck C7-T1. Grade 1 Strains in the mid trapezius at the level of scapular spine (17x7x20mm). Grade 1 Strain rhomboid minor with partial tearing of the fibers at scapular spine (8x2x9mm). 
Left side: Grade 2 Strain upper trapezius at occipital attachment (8x2x10mm). Grade 1 Strain in rhomboid minor (6x2x6mm). Grade 2 Strain and partial tearing of fibers in the supraspinatus muscle at superolateral aspect of supraspinatus fossa. 
They took an Xray and only found a loss of lordotic curve. 

I got treated as if it was chronic pain, loaded with pain meds and told to tape my shoulders while playing basketball. I got trigger point injections for a while and tried to just numb the pain. The migraines subsided with Propanalol. 
I got an MRI in January 2023.

At a major tournament in February 2023, I got sent to an Osteopath and they were also horrified with my shoulders and range of motion. They said so much of my back and neck was scar tissue. They worked on me for a while, massaging and adjusting my shoulders and sternum and neck and ribs. I continued to see one when I got home and they have been able to get my left shoulders range of motion and relieved quite a bit of pain but they're stumped with my right.  She thinks either my first rib is out?? Or that I partially dislocated my shoulder when I fell and it healed half out. 
I can't raise that arm without moving my whole shoulder and shoulder blade as unit and even then it's extremely uncomfortable. It's making it so hard to return to sport, with the pain and weakness and numbness. 

MRI came back with straightening and partial reversal of the cervical lordosis and midly reduced disc hydration at C5-C6. 

What should I do next? How do I fix this? It's over a year old injury at this point and I feel like I can hardly use my right arm. The tension headaches come often and any activity with my arms (even driving) gives me pain.

Hello, I've been having this issue on and off for years now, and after it's just reappeared I'm starting to get pretty annoyed about it's persistence.

There is a small, sand grain-sized bump, that keeps reappearing on the underside of my right eyelid. I know it's a bump and not a random spec of dust because it's always in the same spot, does not wash away with water and does not fall out when I lift my eyelid. I however have not seen it.

It disappears and reappears within the blink of an eye, literally. I can be minding my own business, doing whatever, when suddenly after a blink I feel this horrible, irritating sensation digging into my right eye. I go to wash my eye and after some time, realize that it's that damn bump again, here to stay for however long, while making my life just that bit more miserable just by existing. Then I'll live with it for days/weeks/months, and one wonderful day I'll just blink and it'll be gone. Poof. Just like that.

Couple of notes about it that I can think of off the top of my head:

• It seems to mostly appear whenever I'm heading to bed. This often results in a lack of sleep that night, because the very act of closing my eye feels like stabbing it with a toothpick.
• I can feel it with my cornea when I close my eye and move it to probe around. It is near the edge of my eyelid towards the outer corner of the eye. It always reappears in this same spot.
• I have bad hay allergies, but this does not seem related. It appears during any time of the year and does not go away with allergy meds, neither eye drops nor oral medications.
• The timing of appearance/disappearance, and duration of existence seem completely random. Sometimes it lasts a couple of hours, other times I've had to live with it for months. It always appears or disappears extremely quickly though (literally within the blink of an eye)

My main questions are: Just what the hell is this thing? Does it have a name? Can I prevent/treat it somehow?

Any and all information is very much appreciated.

I recently had a CT scan as well as a colonoscopy after having months of unintentional weight loss (20 lbs in 2-3 months). 

The CT scan showed inflammation in some part of my colon/intestines, but when the colonoscopy was done, it came back pretty normal. They did take some random biopsies but my doctor didn’t say much else. Is this normal? How can something show up on a CT scan but not appear during a colonoscopy? My primary said he was sure I had IBD but since nothing was found during my colonoscopy, I have no idea what to think. 

I totally thought this would finally bring some answers after months of fecal, urine, and blood testing as well as a hospitalization for hypokalemia. But now I feel at a total loss.

For years, I've been having the need to go to the bathroom very frequently and my bowels are sensitive. Often times I feel the need to poop a 2nd time immediately after the first. I also get other symptoms like bloating and gastrointestinal distress. I always have to poop right after a meal.

I got tested for celiac disease, lactose intolerance and H pylori, which were all negative.

In February, I had a CT scan of Abdomen &amp; Pelvis w/ contrast which didn't show anything abnormal. My family doctor concluded that it is likely IBS.

I'm from Canada, currently on vacation in Florida. Starting a week ago, I had some more intense gastrointestinal upset than usual that lasted few days.

Today I noticed my poop is extremely flaky with chunks of red that looks like blood. I remember seeing red chunks in the past. I recall my poop has sometimes had these chunks in it for the past few weeks. I also recalled that for months, I sometimes saw a few black spots in my poop which could be blood clots.

I am diagnosed with Pcos and Hidradenitis suppurativa 

Current medications: Humira, Yaz, metformin, latuda, lexapro and Buspar

For the last year or two, I have been getting a large rash on different parts of my body every couple months or so. Most recently (pic in post) it covered my back, butt, and hips. When it starts to heal it almost appears as a bruise. Sometimes purple or yellowish. In the past it has been on my thighs and lower stomach.

I have the same symptoms everytime I get a rash. Extreme fatigue, light-headedness, chills and sweats but no fever. The rash is painful and itchy. 

The rash appears to come randomly. It does not correlate with my cycle, what ive eaten, lotions/perfumes or with my humira injections.

I've been to my dermatologist and have had a biopsy that came back with no results. I was told it was contact dermatitis and to use sensitive laundry detergent but I'm still getting the rashes sporadically.

Any idea of what could be causing this?

I have been struck down with strep throat, which is a bacterial infection of the throat for those unaware. I went and got it checked out and have been prescribed penicillin pills to treat it.

I looked it up and realized they are probably connected and from either the same source or the strep got into my eye. Now pinkeye is pretty contagious and I don't want to spread it to friends and family. But I'm already on the penicillin pills from the strep, which should have neutralized the contagion, right?

313,AskDocs,"TL;DR- Currently 235lbs,  late forties, Caucasian/African American with controlled hypertension and diabetes. 

Vigorous work causes, dizziness (feeling of fainting), nausea, blurred vision, alarming head pressure w/simultaneous diminished hearing. 

Symptoms end only after a long period of rest.



Working out at the gym one day years ago same routine, finished with leg presses. Got home, head felt like the pressure had increased* big time, slowly my vision clouded with stars, hearing diminished whenever I became vertical and felt like I'd fall or faint.

These symptoms have repeated off and on for over a decade. On one occasion, I cleaned the van for a family trip, lots of bending and moving. Time to go and symptoms kicked in. I felt so dizzy I became nauseated. (We stopped at Chick-fil-A and passed on eating I felt so bad😬😬...so I really felt bad. )

Whenever vigorous work is involved, I get these symptoms. The worst I've had was 3 yrs ago, after an intense workout. I've never asked to be taken to the ER in my life and the wife was gonna shower THEN take me.I told her to call 911 as I just couldn't wait. ER determined I had a migraine as I vomiting and complaining about head pressure.

I've presented this to my doctor many times. I currently have  reoccurring neck pain, shoulder pain both sides and numbness that comes and goes in fingers on my left hand. Besides the neck pain, there is NO other pain involved. 

Lastly, I've been renovating my home, involving lots of painting and mudding. Symptoms come on after working overhead especially, beginning with diminished strength in my left arm, which is my dominant arm/hand.


 I've seen a few specialists but no one has nailed down anything yet. (I will elaborate on that after hearing what anyone thinks here so as not to give info to steer you into a diagnosis...hope that's ok)

319,AskDocs,"Hello,

I'm a 35 yr old male. 35 BMI as I'm 250 lbs at 5'11"" height (in obese category). 

I've had some GERD type problems for the last few years. With burping and acid reflex issues. I also had a little bit of bloating too along with it. My doctor recommended a endoscopy for that, will be getting one in the coming weeks.

Now I got bloating and constipation the last 2 weeks or so. I have been drinking stuff like prune juice and eating bananas. So the constipation eventually turns into a diarrhea after a while. Plus I keep getting cramps around my rectum area and that lower side of the body. Do I have to go for a colonoscopy now?

I had my yearly check up back in February. And my doc was OK with it. My blood work was normal. Only issue was a little bit of fatty liver (ALT level). My doc said that's mainly because I'm obese now. Losing weight should reverse that.

I might be scratching in my sleep but it also makes it extremely difficult to fall asleep because the itching is so bad.

322,AskDocs,"Okay r/AskDocs, I need help with my 8 year old son.   
Current Meds: Symbicort, Singulair, Cyproheptadine, Flonase, Miralax, Kondremul
Medical History: 25 week micro-preemie, asthma, paraplegic spastic gait, failure to thrive (he weighs 40lbs), encopresis, sensory processing disorder      

Back Story: He has always been constipated for as long as I can remember. When he was almost 3 weeks old in the NICU, they weaned him off of a ventilator and introduced fortified breast milk. His belly was so distended and he didn’t have a bowel movement for a long enough amount of time that his doctors actually thought he was developing NEC. Eventually he did have a BM and things seemed to “normalize” but he’s continued to be constipated. He’s been on Miralax since he was a baby and at times when it gets really bad, we’ve used Exlax and suppository enemas.    
When he was 4, he developed spastic paraplegic gait and had a brain MRI. While the neurologist did say he had leukomalacia, they ruled his MRI normal. They did say that they couldn’t guarantee it wasn’t a mild case of cerebral palsy, but they didn’t order any further work up. This was in 2019.     

We’ve been working with GI since last year to address feeding issues and failure to thrive. He is an extremely picky eater, refuses to drink water or really anything other than milk. He had a normal upper endoscopy last October. He was put on cyproheptadine but his eating habits remain unchanged and he hasn’t gained much weight at all.    
Now they’re treating him for his constipation with 30 mLs of Kondremul 3 times per day. He’s gone through an entire bottle in the last week, on top of a capful of Miralax every day and he hasn’t had a bowel movement in 2 weeks at this point.      
His last bowel movement on 4/7 happened in such a strange way. He still wears pull-ups and night and when he woke up that morning, there was an extremely large, hard, dry stool in his pull up. He claims this happened in his sleep but I’m having a hard time understanding how someone could pass a soft-ball sized hard stool while sleeping.    
Since yesterday I’ve given him a square of Exlax and today 10mg of bisacodyl, still nothing. I know we’re probably approaching the point of needing an ER visit but his GI doctor doesn’t seem to think so unless he is in pain (he’s not currently).    
      
Aside from the obvious, that he needs to clear all of the stool out of his system, I’m having some serious concerns about the root of all of this and I feel dismissed by his doctors. I’m sick of being told that this is normal and to keep pumping him full of laxatives. His body clearly doesn’t respond to them. And it crushes me when he has accidents because he literally can’t tell when he has to poop.    
       
Could there be something more going on? Could this be related to his premature birth or his spastic gait issues? He’s been in PT since birth and he still struggles with extremely tight hamstrings and limited mobility. I’ve asked for another neurology referral to see if maybe they can look at his spine.    
Am I doing the right thing? What else can I do to help him? I’m so scared he’ll end up in the ER again to clear out the backed up stool. Last time that happened a few months ago he ended up with lacerations on his backside and was completely traumatized by the experience.

325,AskDocs,"Hi, all. I'm 43 F, 5'4"", 55 kg, Asian. 

Found a lump under my chin, (a bit to the right side) almost a month ago. Took 2 rounds of antibiotics, one round of Clindamycin 300 prescribed by my dentist for tooth infection (had some teeth extracted at the time), and the other a round of Cefuroxime 500 by an ENT who told me I had pharyngitis. Both told me they were pretty sure lump was a swollen lymph node due to infection. ENT, in fact, said he could not find lump even though I tried to show him, as it seemed to have shrunk at the time.

4 days into taking the 2nd round of antibiotics, I was still really anxious about the lump. It seemed to be shrinking then growing then shrinking then growing again. I tried to look it up and everything still pointed to swollen lymph nodes but I really wanted to make sure it was nothing since, (1) I have been a long-time heavy smoker, and (2) my father passed from liver cancer 3 years ago. I went to another ENT who saw I had a lot of issues going on, aside from the lump, including LP reflux and chronic laryngitis, swelling in my salivary glands and TMJ. As for the lump, she said she was pretty sure that it was a blocked salivary gland considering its behavior of growing and shrinking. I asked her if there was anything more concerning going on and she said she was not seeing anything that looked like cancer but that considering my history, she ordered a CT scan of oral cavity and neck.

Got the results yesterday and this is the most worrisome part:

""Plain and contrast CT of the neck and closed mouth CT examination of the oral cavity shows two (2) small solid nodules with low attenuating central components, one each posterior to both mandibular angles at the junctions of the masticator space and parotid space.  The nodule on the right measures 1.1 cm widest diameter, while the nodule on the left measures 1.7 cm widest diameter. They do not enhance and they show no calcifications.

Impression:  Small necrotic lymph nodes located posterior to both mandibular angles measuring approximately 1.1 cm on the right and 1.7 cm on the left.""

She had me get a chest X-ray done because apparently, necrotic lymph nodes can either be from cancer or tuberculosis. I'm still waiting for the results and will have to wait a few more days before my ENT's next clinic schedule. I really don't know what to do now. I'm trying to find hope that it's not as bad as I'm afraid it could be but I'm finding it hard. These two nodes aren't even the ones I came in for. There is nothing in the CT scan about the one under my chin. Also the ENT said that they had central necrosis, which from what I'm seeing from some literature is a bad thing. It would be better if it turned out to be just tuberculosis but then I don't have any symptoms like that. I also couldn't find any definitive literature on what else can cause this necrosis. 

I go to my checkups alone and I want to be prepared if there are any tests I should ask for or what my next steps should be, because I'm scared and alone and I couldn't think straight so I might not be able to ask the right questions or for the right tests when I go back in.",t2_pbikbepx,0,Please help.

I was supposed to go and get a PET scan done yesterday but instead I went to a walk-in clinic to get my Kidney/liver checked. I had sediment in my urine but my urine was clearish looking in color just white floaters and a lot. I'm having some kidney pain today so it probably tracks with what's going on.

They took the blood tests and told me yesterday that they would tell me my results today, fast forward to today and the nurse told me to wait for my follow up appointment for the 25th to go over the results with my GP. I'm concerned and just super curious as to what could possibly show up that would be abnormal but not an emergency. I would assume if it were emergent they would have told me or sent me to an ER or to get a follow up appointment sooner. 

I've been drinking a lot more water today and yesterday than I have in a couple of months and the last ER visit I went to (2 weeks ago) the doctor said I was dehydrated and they gave me an IV. The reason I keep going back to the ER is because I have long covid and all my symptoms are scary as all hell sometimes. What could possibly be going on in my body that it's not a concern for fast treatment but a little concerning to have it be talked about by my doctor? Also I had no fever so it wasn't an infection that I know of. I also take a lot of medications as well as Meloxicam which is an NSAID and was thinking maybe that is what's causing it?

12 days ago I woke up needing to pee and feeling a strong itch inside my bladder and urethra that wouldn't let me sleep.

Then on the 8th day it flared after urinating at night making my entire groin, inner thighs and lower belly feel very hot and sensitive all night to the point that putting a pillow between my thighs hurt, after that flare it went down again and the symptoms have bee  kinda coming and going while getting lower in intensity but never truly gone.

Urine test (that I took a couple of days after the flareup) showed very low/negligible bacteria.

I still get itchiness through the length of the urethra after urinating that takes about an hour to go away. I'm not sexually active.

Should I get tested again?

340,AskDocs,"My 5M, 120cm, 15kg, caucasian,  is experiencing a mix of symptoms, we're being sent to a different specialist but no one seems interested in putting everything together and I truly feel there's more going on. He does have a sleep study scheduled in May. He currently takes 80 mg of Jornay PM. He started on 40 MG in Sept 2022.

Long Story:

In utero, I had genetic testing done that came back inconclusive for a trisomy (unsure of which). He had a concerning amount of fluid on his neck towards the end of pregnancy. I had no other complications and after birth, the trisomy and fluid were never brought back up.

Of my 4 children he was the most unsettling as a baby and cried often. He has always been severely irritable.

He met his typical milestones, for the first year or so of walking, he would often run into things. Especially the table if a toy was under it. He hit his head so often by running into things that I took him to the pediatrician specifically for it. The ped suggested he may have vision problems or just be hyper-focusing.

He has always rocked back and forth and if he's asked to stay still he falls asleep. A former ped was shocked when he fell asleep because she asked him to stop just long enough to listen to his heartbeat. She suggested he was just ""wired differently.""

He attended mothers day out ages 3-4. He was given the ""class comedian,"" award at the end of the year. I distinctly remember his teacher yelling his name 10x over trying to get his attention. He would often fall asleep in the middle of lunch at the table.

In prek the sleep issue became much more prominent. He began falling asleep standing up, while dancing or singing in music class, randomly in lines, particularly after meals, and even on stage while standing and practicing (&amp; performing) for his class music show.  His teacher dismissed it and assumed he wasn't getting sleep. He really struggled with handwriting and drawing.

This year he began kinder, he has a MUCH more involved and vocal teacher. His teacher and para (who has a son with epilepsy) ask the nurse to set in for a week and watch my son. After doing so the nurse reached out and was very concerned, she believed he may have epilepsy and his sleep episodes were actually seizures. (I should add, at times he would fall asleep for less than 2 min then have a sudden burst or energy OR start crying saying his brain hurt) I have videos of both I could share. At this point he already had an appointment to see a behavior specialist for a pretty strong case of ADHD, but we went ahead and saw an NP neurologist also. He had an EEG done and was recommended for an autism eval. The EGG was negative. The neurologist was diagnosed with mild-moderate autism, developmental coordination disorder, and SPD. The behavior specialist diagnosed him with severe ADHD and ODD. Around the same time I took him for a regular eye exam. The doctor believed both of his optic nerves were swollen. The next day we saw a pediatric ophthalmologist. She ensured us his optic nerves were fine and is having us come back next month (6 month post apt) to check again but his medical history notes  Primary open angle glaucoma under-diagnosis/indications, this was not brought up at the apt so I can't confirm. He occasionally complains of headaches or his brain hurting.

345,AskDocs,"I will try to give as much information as possible, since I am also just learning what is told to my mother, who is highly in shock due to the recent events. 

My grandmother F(72) had a quite urgent yet still an elective open heart valve (aortic?) replacement on Monday, during which they also tried to fix some kind of an arrhythmia (not sure if atrial or ventricular, but I know she dealt with a-fib). Surgery took about 9 hours, and seemed to involve bleeding complications, so her sternum has been left open post-surgery. She underwent delayed sternal closure the next day, but was still being paced as her heart was not getting into a rhythm on its own. This was explained to us as the possible consequence of taking beta-blockers as well as anti-arrhythmic drugs and anticoagulant pre-surgery for many years.

Third day after surgery, we received an update that they are going to be waking up grandma from the induced coma, which they did. However, today’s update has left everyone confused, and my mom is in shock from the doctor’s insensitivity. He didn’t mention any complications, but said that grandma is on a “out of body circulation” (I assume ECMO?), is awake and responsive. But that her chance for survival has been about 5% since the beginning, which no one mentioned at all before electing to undergo the surgery, and that they will shut the ECMO down on Sunday. 

This is obviously a very different response from the day before, and seems unethical on a patient who is awake? This will also be only one week post-surgery.

350,AskDocs,"**TL;DR**  *I went through 5 PCPs in 7 years trying to figure out why my globulin was low. 3 were suspicious, 2 were dismissive. Whether you were one of the 3 or the 2, would you want to know the cause was a rare primary immunodeficiency disease?*

* 32 Female.  
* Never smoker, never drugs, infrequent alcohol. 
* Dx'd with CVID last week.  
* Typical CVID history.  
* I carry the TNFRS13B monogenic defect for CVID.

* Drug allergies: mupirocin, cephalexin.  
* Chronic diarrhea after z-pack.  
* Always come down with a cold/sinus infection when I'm around ""new"" people (coworkers, classmates, family holiday celebrations, etc.)

In Feb 2016, I moved from AR to San Francisco, CA and established with a new PCP#1. She ran basic labs and noted it was odd that my globulin was low but total protein was low-normal with high A/G ratio. She asked if I was anorexic (no), suggested I eat more protein and that we'd follow up in a couple months.  3 weeks later I moved to Houston, TX and couldn't follow up with her. 

In Feb 2017, I established with a new PCP#2.  She ran labs &amp; said everything was normal. I asked about the low globulin, she told me it's nothing, just to eat more protein. I did, the numbers didn't budge, I got a horrible sinus infection and by July, I was getting my tonsils removed (at 26yo). I continued to get sinus infections every few months, with 4-6 weeks of bronchitis after each one. After using a z-pack for the one in Dec 2018, I developed chronic diarrhea and intolerance to animal fats. 2019 I lost my insurance. 

In 2020, I regained insurance, but my previous health system was excluded.  I established with a new PCP#3 in Feb, right before lockdowns.  She ran labs, normal.  I pointed out the low globulin, she said -- you guessed it -- eat more protein. I told her I'd already been doing that, she seemed skeptical &amp; suggested tofu. Okay. What about the chronic diarrhea? She didn't know.  Then lockdowns happened &amp; only emergencies could be seen. 

During lockdown, bc I'm a genetics nerd (my mom has a rare genetic disease), I bought my whole family dtc DNA kits. My goal from the outset was to extract the raw data files for everybody, throw them into Promethease, and just play around with it. (I was also hoping to find carrier-status of my mom's disease, so I &amp; my siblings would have evidence to support confirmatory genetic testing.)

In Nov 2020, I started a new job 3 hours away as a teacher. From then til May 2021, I was at urgent care every 2-3 weeks it seemed for some kind of infection. It wasn't covid, and the resp. panels were always negative.  We couldn't figure it out. I got my covid vaccines ASAP &amp; wore my mask everywhere. I returned to Houston in June after my contract ended. 

In Aug 2021, I got covid, ran a really high fever, PCP#3 got me into the Regeneron infusion.  I never got better (long-hauler w/ neurological manifestations).  PCP#3's availability was 4 months out, so I had to see one of her colleagues twice in the interim.  Colleague immediately pointed out that my globulin was low.  When I saw her again, she said she remembered exactly who I was bc it was really weird that my globulin was low but everything else was normal. She encouraged me to ask PCP#3 at my next visit.

So this got my wheels turning.  I remembered my Promethease report showed that I'm a carrier for a gene responsible for CVID, but ""penetrance unclear."" I researched CVID, and my medical history was textbook presentation.  

 At my next appointment (in Jan 2022), I showed my PCP#3 the Promethease report  and asked her if that might explain my consistently low globulin and frequent sinus infections. PCP said my globulin was low because I needed to eat more protein (how could I possibly eat more?!). And I certainly didn't have CVID because it's exceedingly rare, I didn't have a documented history of pneumonia, that people with CVID would have been hospitalized with respiratory infections as children and I didn't fit that description. When I pressed about the genetic test, she lectured me about how inaccurate those tests are and not to trust them.

After that, I lost all trust in *her*.

I promptly established with a new PCP#4, back in my preferred health system (PCP#2 moved away). PCP#4 ran labs, noted the globulin, referred me to hematology. Hematology ruled out cancer, dx'd hypogam &amp; referred me to the fancy immunologist in Houston's Medical Center. After 9 months with the immunologist, multiple different tests and vaccine trials, we finally reached a diagnosis - CVID.",t2_w6hed,0,"If you missed (or correctly suspected) a rare diagnosis, would you want to be informed?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tkdd3,True,mhmthatsmyshh,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tkdd3/if_you_missed_or_correctly_suspected_a_rare/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tkdd3/if_you_missed_or_correctly_suspected_a_rare/,476181,1682036605,0,,False,1682036620,1682036620,2023-04-21 00:23:25,,,

352,AskDocs," 33/M/Caucasion no drugs smoking or drinking. I take a twice a day SSRI. I'm 5'10 tall and 160 lbs ish. 

I've had flu like symptoms since Monday. My fever is all over the place, but my tylenol every 6 hours keeps it to around 100-101.5. It averages at around 102.5 without it, but under blankets at night it has a peaked over 103 a few times. Highest was 104. I've since avoided the blankets, and been using cool/lukewarm cloths on the neck.  Aches and chills, but aches mostly gone away. Chills are the worst part still. No energy. A bit of congestion, but could be my allergies. No real cough - just when I have post nasal drip. My SP02 has been reading normal. 

I'm considering alternating ibuprofen and upping to 1000 mg instead of 500 per dose for tylenol. I've only been taking 500Mg every 6 hours. My main question is, is this a medical concern? Should I continue to ride it out? I get very mixed results online about level fever is a concern and how long a fever is a concern. Some say more than 3 days, go to ER. Some say over 103, ER. Others say no worries. Well, I'm asking if it's worries? Should I see an urgent care or give it a few more days and see if it clears on it's own, and continue treating with rest+fluids+tylenol (And maybe add ibuprofen).",t2_rnud72b3,0,"Flu symptoms going on 5 days, temp (possibly?) high off and on",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tk6c4,True,Manolgar,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tk6c4/flu_symptoms_going_on_5_days_temp_possibly_high/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tk6c4/flu_symptoms_going_on_5_days_temp_possibly_high/,476180,1682036155,0,,False,1682036170,1682036171,2023-04-21 00:15:55,,,

356,AskDocs,"I (16M, 5’7”, 102lbs) had taken triple the dosage of my Adderall prescription (Prescribed for ADHD). The dosage is 30 MG and it says it’s amphetamine/dextroamphetamine 24HR as well (I’m 95% sure that’s Adderall) I do not take anything else.
I had taken two pills at around 3 pm yesterday, and one pill this morning at around 6:40 am.

(I am not an addict, and I do not like these drugs. They sit on my dresser because I hate them so much. These were not taken for recreational use, and they are prescribed to me)

I felt as if I were about to pass out during my classes, (though I did not sleep last night so that could just be that), my heartbeat randomly became irregular, I was getting hot flashes very badly, sweating excessively, and the blood drained from my hands, feet, and face. My hands were borderline grey. I am aware of elevated heart rate being a symptom, but the poor blood circulation? Randomly, at around 9 am however, the blood rushed instantly back to my face and I looked as if I had been crying for hours and it wasn’t going down until a bit later.

Right now, my heartbeat occasionally skips or pounds harder than usual, and my hands are more cold than usual, but i’m worried about the pain in my legs. They’re almost like growing pains; not surface level. I am in a lot of pain (I honestly just have low pain tolerance) Is it safe for me to take Advil?

I have an EMG for my leg scheduled next week. -Thanks &lt;3",t2_111mx8,0,Unexplained thigh pain,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tjona,True,softpretzel92,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tjona/unexplained_thigh_pain/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tjona/unexplained_thigh_pain/,476178,1682034989,0,,False,1682035000,1682035000,2023-04-20 23:56:29,,,

Went to urgent care on Sunday. They did not have an x-ray machine, but the doctor said that she felt that it was likely bruised or maybe intercostal strain. She listened to my lungs and said they sounded okay. Said to seek further care if pain got worse and sent me on my way.

372,AskDocs,"Hello, I'm a 26 year old female. I have Connective Tissue Disorder and was told by a Geneticists that it's one that hasn't been discovered, so it doesn't have a name or any research or information. Thankfully, my joints have never dislocated, but my hips often sublux. My knees are also very loose and my right kneecap actually rubs against my tibia. I have pain pretty much all over my body that's usually the same strength as kidney stones so for me to really complain about a certain pain, I'm really in severe pain. Honestly, I didn't even complain when I had my first kidney stone. Anti-inflammatories stopped working for me and the most they do is bring my pain down by a tiny bit. But it's not enough to risk damage to my stomach. 

Anyway, onto my spine and left hip.  

On March 8, 2023, I was going through some boxes and there was a huge box I kept having to awkwardly maneuver around. While trying to maneuver around the box and around the room, my left hip slipped out of place and subluxed. It was 11pm when I noticed my hip was not in place. I tried shifting my hips but it wouldn't go back in place and then I tried walking around and it still wouldn't go back in place. I then went to go lay down on my heated blanket to let my muscles around my hip relax then I pushed on my hip joint to try to push it back into place and it still wouldn't go back in. My dog then let me know that he needed to go potty so I very slowly walked down the stairs, using the wall for support. It was very painful. While waiting on my dog to go potty, I walked around downstairs and my hip finally popped back into place. I checked the time to see how long my hip was subluxed and it was now midnight. 

My hip hurt pretty badly for a few days afterwards. I kept having to take Aleve and keep heat on it. I couldn't lay on it. Then my spine started hurting. The pain is tight, hot, stiff, sharp, throbbing, very strong, and very intense. There was one day where my back had tremors. When it's really irritated, my back, legs, and arms will go numb. Not like pins and needles but there's so much pain that I don't have the strength to move. It is consistently like this even when I take Aleve. I did try to use a Recumbent Exercise Bike after my mom, who's a nurse, said it would relieve the pain and it just made it worse. 

I was going to try to wait until my Rheumatology appointment on May 8, 2023 but my mom is treating me really horribly about my back so I plan to go to the ER tomorrow night to at least find out what's going on. I would just like to know what I can expect tomorrow if I'm taken seriously. 

My mom keeps claiming that I'm ""laying in bed all the time"" and that's why my back hurts. My bed is set up to reduce joint pain. I have two heated blankets and a memory foam mattress. Either way, it would not be causing pain this severe. Then my mom tried blaming my weight. I gained weight in 2020 because of Hypothyroidism and I've actually lost 20 pounds this year already. My joint pain stayed the same compared to before I gained weight, though. My mom has actually always ignored my medical issues but the way she's acting now really hurts. I actually asked my mom why she doesn't care and she said ""I don't deserve her sympathy because I don't take her advice"".

Hi there

several  years ago I got an itch in my urethra, then balanitis (this stressed me  out), then a few days later itching, tingling, crawling, muscle  twitching, stabbing pain and mild folliculitis in my legs / lower  regions, after a  month it settled down but was always there in the  background. I have been sexually active with 2 people, and had not had  sex for around 2 weeks when this first happened, the person I was with  when this happened (still with, no sexual partner since) was the second  sexual partner I have been with and we had been sexually active with for  about half a year before, so I doubt it is venereal in nature, but who  knows. Since then I would also get balanitis that flairs up when I'm  stressed, I shower every day with proper hygiene, I'm very hygienic and  rarely have colds. Roll forward many years later and I had a sore on my  lip (not herpes, swab and blood test shown I don't have HSV1 or 2) and  some on my scalp, then two days later I had tingling and buzzing  sensation along with twitching etc all over my head and hands, I got  stressed, some hive like symptoms along with itching and folliculitus  appears, over the weeks and months it spread all over the body in  certain patches, seemingly symmetrical, eg both elbows would be  affected, both hands, both feet etc roughly at the same time. The sudden  and frequent (but brief) nerve pain have been very painful recently and  the past 4 months and I have a chronic ear infection / inflammation  that flairs up a lot causing tinnitus, its just a sudden pain/ pressure  that comes on then leaves almost instantly then I hear a ringing, only a  clean clean diet with no alcohol, coffee, sugar 90% veg and fruit and  settle it. The folliculitis shows up before the nerve pain and twitching  happens. I also get a stabbing feeling in my eyes and they often go  slightly bloodshot where as this never happen before. I've had an MRI  scan on my brain and an EMG, all clear, neurologist isn't worried it is  anything on his end, I'm seeing an ear specialist soon.

I've  had HIV, diabetes, syphilis and the standard STDs ruled out, Ive been  tested by my GP for standard auto immune markers (I don't know how much  detail it shows. but it didn't raise any flags with the standard tests  they did), vitamin deficiencies, EBV, diabetes, blood pressure etc and  they show nothing bad. The mild folliculitis has been described as a  mild and common fungal folliculitis by a dermatologist that diagnoses it  via sight and taking into account my symptoms. The fungal cream got rid  of the twitching and pain for the first week but it came back after a  week, then I went on oral fungal fluconazole pills at 50mg for 2 weeks  didn't get rid of it either (this was seen as overkill for my mild  symptoms by dermatologist). The GP said that steroid cream helps with  all sorts of issues (also could be a placebo maybe?). In the past I had  bad anxiety over something very obscure with regard to health where I  got obsessive and depressed about it and spiraled mentally, I have OCD  and I think this plays into my obsessive thoughts, I definitely had  health anxiety in the past over the obscure thing. Although I am now  cured from that issue and no longer think about it, I thought I was  cured form this mentality, and believe I am, but it is worth mentioning  to give you an overall idea of the situation. I have been very stressed  about this as the nerve pain and twitching has been fairly sever. The  visible symptoms are only the mild folliculitus, small sores on mouth,  slight hive like itch rashes that appear and disappear, some that are  fungal looking that go away after a week that itch and tingle, visible  twitching, sometimes full body twitches, but mostly painless twitches in  groups of 3 or so, but sometimes can last 2 hours worst case scenario  in the thighs mostly, *Seborrhoeic dermatitis,*  and the ear inflammation / infection with tinnitus. Just before this  issue happened, I didn't think I was that stressed / anxious when this  happened, however I was drinking a lot of coffee, alcohol and not  sleeping much, looking at it objectively I did have a lot of stressful  things on the go, but again, I didn't *feel* that stressed, maybe a 3/10.

I  cant think of what else could be causing my symptoms, so my question  is, could this all be psychometric, can your body cause all the above  symptoms all at once when you are not seemingly stressed? I know for a  fact stress makes it worse, but that's not to say it's just stress. The  twitching, nerve pain and folliculitis only happen to specific affected  areas which are now all over the body. I'm just at the point where it  seems like I'm out of ideas what is causing it. I'm aware of my past  where I once made a big deal out of nothing (where I freely admit I got  some kind of body dysphoria over), but I can't help but feel like I  shouldn't ignore my symptoms when I have so many symptoms which could  very possibly be caused by something real, tangible and treatable, so I  could palm this off as all psychosomatic, but I've had it for many  years, but now it has spread, it seems like the issues are too strange  to be all caused by stress / psychometric, especially when I didn't  think I was that stressed?

I've been addicted to opiates since 2009, and have not used any since 2018. Lately, especially when under stress, I've been noticing this insatiable feeling inside of me. No medicine or typical outlet (spending time with friends, breath work, yoga, sex, medicine, etc) feels satisfying. It's been going on for a few weeks now...it doesn't feel like anxiety or depression, nor does it feel like a trauma response (I am a mental health professional by trade but not as well versed in substance use treatment as perhaps I should be).

I will definitely mention this to my psychiatrist, however I was hoping to crowdsource some opinions about whether anyone else has had such powerful cravings so many years after last use that experience benefit from long term MAT. I'm hesitant to reintroduce any medication of that sort without a strong sense that it is truly needed and will be beneficial.

389,AskDocs,"Hello!

\# Background

I'm a 20M in college who enjoys running for fun. Around September, I noticed some stiffness in my knee. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with mild patellar tendonitis. I was told running should be okay, but to do strength exercises like squats to strengthen muscles around the patella. I started squatting, and sure enough, the patellar tendonitis got better!

A few months later, in February, I started feeling an ""off putting"" sensation in my left achilles. I had previously dealt with achilles tendonitis a couple years ago and was pretty sure it was that. So, I took about a month and a half off from running, and went to the weight room twice a week, one day for legs, one day for arms. I did exercises like calf raises to help the achilles. However, in an attempt to avoid hurting my achilles, I had stopped squatting, and the patellar tendonitis has returned.

\# As of April

I have been doing short runs for about 4 weeks now. For the first week, I ran just 1 mile one day. For the second week, I ran 1.5 miles Monday, 2 Wednesday, 2 Friday. For the third week, I ran 2 miles Monday, Wednesday, Friday. This week, the fourth week, I ran 2 miles Monday, 1 Wednesday. Not sure what I will do tomorrow.

For all of these runs, I have attempted to change my running form. I am working to decrease the length of my stride and increase cadence. I'm also working on adapting to a mid-foot strike from a heel-strike. I have been going at about 6:50 pace for these, and sometimes closer to 6:40 pace. I'm not trying to run this fast; I accidentally keep doing so as I'm trying to increase my cadence.

My achilles feels mostly good! I don't notice it at all when I run. But this week, \*after\* the runs, my left achilles feels a little bit... idk... tingly? It usually goes away pretty quick. I notice it at random times in the day, typically if I'm walking, especially if I'm trying to pay attention to anything weird (i.e., sensations in my achilles or patella). I also feel it on my following recovery day.

It's important to note that it does not hurt. On a pain scale 1-10, I'd have to give it 0.5. It's simply something I notice.

\# The Question

Is it okay to keep running? Should I bring down the milage? The speed? Should I mix walking and running?

401,AskDocs,"I’ve seen multiple doctors and so far received no answers. I’m not asking to be diagnosed, but maybe for some guidance so I can do a little research that I can present to my neurologist. 

I describe the feeling as “ghost limbs” or dissociation. Like my legs will still have feeling but not quite feel like they’re there. Like there a slight lack of awareness. An example I experience today that was kind of scary is when I was driving and my hands were at 9 and 3, but it felt like they were at 8 and 2. And then it felt like they were moving forward and backward through the steering wheel. But at the same time, I could also still feel that my hands were where they actually were. It’s like the two sensations were split 50/50 which is why I call it “ghost limbs”. This didn’t used to happen very often, maybe every week or two, and usually only when I was lying down and only in my legs. But it’s been becoming more frequent and happening to more of my body and the sensations are changing and becoming more varied. This symptom and all below started October 2021. They all fluctuate in severity. Except the occipital neuralgia lol that one’s a bitch. 

So far I’ve seen an ENT, two neurosurgeons, and three neurologists. I have a negative VNG and a negative EEG. 

I’ve been diagnosed with chiari malformation type 1, 3-5 mm, but been told by every single doctor that it is asymptomatic. My cervical MRI showed that my neck has lost its curve. I’ll be starting physical therapy soon to correct that. 

Other symptoms include vertigo (can’t figure out a trigger but the pain specialist attributes this to the occipital neuralgia), occipital neuralgia (i just started seeing a pain specialist for this to get nerve blocks - between him and two of my neurologists, it has been determined that this is being caused by muscle tension in my neck and traps), and lower back of head pain (which has also been attributed to tight muscles). I have also been diagnosed with migraines but that appears to be taken care of with medication.

So all of my symptoms have been figured out or explained away except this one.

Medications: Nikki birth control, hydroxyzine occasionally for anxiety. Took Buspirone for 2 days 2 weeks ago but stopped because of increased anxiety. 

I’ve been having some weird symptoms lately, and I think there’s a possibility that they could just be anxiety, but I’m nervous that something else is going on.

My period came two weeks early, despite being on birth control, and I’ve been on birth control for almost a year. This has happened once before, and I had extremely irregular periods while off of birth control, so  I’m not sure how concerning this is.

Additionally, my heart has felt like it’s beating very weirdly for the last two weeks. As mentioned above, I was prescribed Buspirone to help with a pretty severe bout of anxiety I was going through a few weeks ago, but I only took it for two days because my heart felt like it was beating both harder and more irregularly. My heartbeat now normally feels both hard and fast, even though I’m pretty active.

I’ve also had these weird feelings of numbness in random parts of my body. It’s not like complete numbness, more like a static-y feeling in places like my foot, forearm, and face. These only last for a few minutes, and I don’t think I’ve noticed them when I’ve been preoccupied with other things, which makes me lean toward anxiety. As I mentioned earlier, I had a pretty bad bout of anxiety a few weeks ago that came out of nowhere, but I feel significantly calmer than I did then and am back to functioning like normal.

I got blood work done about three weeks ago, and it came back normal, with the exception of monocytes being slightly high (percentage and actual count, but only by a little bit). Is this just anxiety and a coincidental irregular period, or should I be more concerned?

I made a point to workout everyday at the hotels and do Sauna and what not to keep myself healthy. 

I came back home and had my sisters wedding so the days prior to that I had to also sleep late, eat poorly and drink more than I like to. 

After all of this I’ve been feeling exhausted, I’m always sleepy, with brain fog and just not having it. 

I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, yoga and workout at home with weights. My body seems to be able to keep it up without loosing performance but it takes longer to recover and I can’t feel recovered even if I sleep 9 hours and have a good diet and not drink. 

As for supplements I’m taking creatine, Omega 3, vitamin D and zinc. 

I’m a bit afraid because my performance in work is not great because of the brain fog and feel like I don’t want to do anything. Am I still recovering from the jet lag, poor diet and chronic drinking and poor sleep?

How do I make it go away?

I had a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in June. With no issues. 

Monday: Symptoms started with what I thought was a migraine, stabbing pain behind right eye with increase in headache when standing and moving around. I took 1g alvedon and felt no improvement. Tried to sleep it off. 

Tuesday: Migraine continued. I napped with an ice pack on my head most of the day and took an over the counter sumatriptan, 1gr alvedon, and 800mg paracetamol in the evening. 

Wednesday: woke up feeling some temporary relief to the stabbing eye pain, but still had a headache that worsened with activity. Noticed a swollen painful lump the size of a marble on the back of my neck about 2inches from the back of my ear. Painful to the touch, pressing down increases headache and prompts mild nausea. Took 1 gr alvedon before bed. 

Thursday: Less eye pain but still enough to cause squinting and still have heavy headache and am quite sore around the swollen lump. Got a massage with no improvement, to headache or soreness, took 1gr Alvedon. 

I’m currently traveling away from home and am wondering if this is urgent or can wait till I am back home Monday.

I’ve gotten in the bad habit of ripping the hang nails off my cuticles and about a week ago my thumb got a yellow puss infection. We drained the puss pocket and I treated with alcohol and Neosporin. 

Now the skin where the puss pocket was is gone but I have a nasty bruise under my nail. Also I’m kind of worried about the random white blob under my nail. 

The pain is almost down to nothing.

None of which would cause a false positive (my rheumatologist did tell me that) I thought it was just the medications making me feel horrible (genetic dystonia, and migraines) but as the days go by I feel worse and worse mentally and physically. I hate that stupid Labcorp sends out the test results to the patients…. Sure, I could not look but who wouldn’t. Almost everything else were in the normal range except for these values. My doctor’s nurse called me after hours after I left a message asking when I would be able to schedule an appt to go over the results and she was reviewing them as I was on the phone with her. I asked her if my doctor had reviewed these and she said no but there is nothing to be worried about and I am clear of all autoimmune diseases and wished me luck. The lack of professionalism ugh! I will make an appt with the full panel with a different rheumatologist but until then can someone help me.

Hey guys I’ve got supplements to take, and I just wanted to know if it’s safe to take them at the same time, or if I should space certain ones out.

So I already take Vitamin D3 (10,000) and iron (65mg) daily, along with a once daily probiotic (with cranberry extract).

I’m going to start taking 5 additional supplements to help lower my cholesterol, as I have familial hypercholesterolemia, and would like to try supplements before attempting the usual prescribed statins.


They are:
Garlic (1,000mg)
Niacin (500mg)
Turmeric Curcumin with ginger (500mg)
Red yeast rice (600mg)
CoQ10 (50mg) -(it was recommended on the back of the red yeast rice bottle to take CoQ10 along with it)
And ofc I will still be taking the D3 (10,000), iron (65mg), and once daily probiotic.

Past smoker, non-drinker

No changes in detergents, soaps, etc. 

In February, I developed a rash that would come and go. Small, pinprick sized red spots that were blanching. They would typically appear at night on my face and neck or my legs. It started small, then over the course of a week, ended up spreading over most of my body. They would usually be gone by the morning, or significantly faded, then flare again in the evening by the time I was done with work. I went to urgent care and was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide cream and recommended OTC antihistamines. I took Zyrtec before bed and woke up with blotchy red spots covering my whole body, then applied the steroid cream and saw improvement. After that, I did not see an spots appear until more recently. 

I noticed the spots appear again about a week ago. They are not as prominent as before (not as bright and not as many). They tend to only appear on my forearms. They will occasionally spread to my chest, lower abdomen, neck, or face. They are still small, red pinpricks that blanch and they are not itchy. My face will itch, but not always when spots are present. They don’t seem to have any rhyme or reason for their appearance. I will sometimes notice my heart pounding the same time the spots appear. They tend to appear mid day and fade away, then appear again in the evening during/after work and fade by the morning. I tend to spend the day at home and the evening out at work.

I’ve added 3 example photos here:

432,AskDocs," 

\[32F\] I have had persistent, drenching night sweats since November, so much so that I’m changing 2-3 times a night. I’m soaking through my sheets and comforter, regardless of where I sleep, what I wear, or the temperature of the room. 

This happens virtually every night and came on really suddenly. I often wake up with wet hair and pruny fingertips from how sweaty I am :(

My doctor ordered bloodwork in March and said it was normal. We ruled out diabetes, TB, HIV. I went back for more yesterday and the only thing new is that my platelet count went from 460 to 490.

If my bloodwork is not showing anything else abnormal, what could this be caused by? I don't drink alcohol (ever), I'm on antidepressants, but have been for years.  I know night sweats are a red flag for a lot of things, but it’s my only symptom besides fatigue (and I blame that on lack of sleep.) Should I get a second opinion if my dr says all looks fine? I'm so tired :/

I had blood taken by my GP 2 weeks ago now because I was complaing of a blocked nose, feels blocked right under the bridge of my nose, like if I could take it off my face and empty it out I imagine the relief would be amazing kind of blocked. However, doctor told me i have post nasal drip as a lot of my symptoms explained that including my snoring. I was told to buy a nose spray that contained a low dose steroid and to use it for 8 weeks before going back to see them. On a morning I have to clear my nose and throat thoroughly but then that's it done for the full day.

Doctor took a full blood count and everything was fine apart from one of the inflammation markers which she said was very slightly raised and to book an appointment in 4 weeks for a repeat. 

Now, I have lived with health anxiety for the past 10 years and its a real battle for me to not blow things out of proportion. But this has got me naturally for me, very very worried and I am panicking I have cancer. 

Could anyone offer any reassurance or advice as to what the cause of this may be please?

442,AskDocs,"Hi I had blood in my urine 4 days ago , so I went to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me antibiotics (cefixme 400mg). I was on this for 3 days. 

I was looking at my lab results today and there was no indication of any infection, I had this verified by another doctor. 

She reassured me they’d never prescribe a medication that is unsafe for a pregnant woman. Then I asked why was there blood in my urine, she said sometimes the pressure on your bladder can cause that it’s common. She then asked if the doctor prescribed the antibiotics before or after the test results and I said after. She said that is strange.

I don’t feel relieved after that phone conversation. Im in the first trimester, I took antibiotics for no reason. I’m worried it would harm the baby. So now that I took antibiotics and have no infection… what exactly did they do in my system? I don’t know how they work. Why do doctors prescribe things that arnt necessary? 

I’ve felt the side effects from them the nausea, cramping, diarrhea. Does my body just flush them out?

Stopped all vitamins and medications within the week. Stilling to a low gat diet when I can eat. Am losing weight. 

Through most of this month I've been have a sore stomach in the morning, but this week has been brutal.

Medications liptor and vitamin D, b complex multi, fish and garlic oil. All of which have been stopped.

Chronic gastritis off and on, Resistant to PPI. History of ulcers,bile and acid  reflux, celiac disease and liver swelling. 

I think I'm having a bile reflux flare. Acids like vinegar and kombucha are helping with pain. Tums non effective to sometimes effective. Bitter taste in mouth with occasional sore throat. 
Lots of pain on my upper right upper GI. Little appetite. Cannot tolerate fiber. 

Pain when I don't eat. Eating helps eveate it until about an hour afterward where a whole new level of hell activates. 

Last night, I had pain going down in a line on my right side, passed my belly button and below. My full bladder was irritating it and felt like something would pop. Pain was gone by morning, but my stomach remains very sore. 
Movement hurts. I feel very unwell. 
I just had a small snack and am having upper right back pain as well as pain in upper GI. It hurts to breathe.

There is no bloody stool, yet. I'm on the look out for it as it's happened before.

Overall, I feel very sick, but no fever.  I get dizzy and am forgetting things at work. I look pale today.

I have an exercise endurance test coming up soon just to make sure everything's all good but I wanted to ask in the meantime for some insight/advice. 

I'm quite unfit, and 2 years ago they began investigations into my heart because with pretty low/moderate exercise my heart rate exceeded 200bpm with a simple brisk walk on a treadmill on an incline. After being told my doctors and cardiologists that my test results looked good I went back to the gym today and my heart rate was 192 walking at 4.5 km/h at an incline of 18 which was the highest it would go. I did feel dizzy but no chest pain and I have asthma but it also was not being aggravated, so I know the exercise was not too intense. I stopped and just did strength training instead because I didn't want it to go any higher, but all I want to ask is if there's any real risk to my heart rate exceeding 200 if I were to go more intense or exercise for longer. I only ask because google and gym trainers have said it's not supposed to go that high, but if my heart is naturally a bit quicker than most peoples then is there some leeway there for it to go a bit higher?

I was wondering if anyone would be able to spell out my MRI results in layman's terms, and perhaps give me some info regarding whether lesions in certain areas correspond to particular symptoms. Also would be interested to know what the info about the T2 flair actually means. 

This MRI (linked below) was compared to one taken six months earlier. I had not started treatment prior to either MRI being taken. Is it normal for someone with MS to develop this many lesions in 6 months?

I’ve noticed It goes away if I lay down on my stomach and cough or do something that contacts my ab muscles.

I have been suffering with gastro and bowel issues for around two years now, with bad reflux which has gotten better with use of PPI which I now take PRN. 

December 2021 I went to the GP for haemorrhoids where I went through a process of trying multiple treatments: lifestyle change, sitz baths, squatty potty, laxido, anusol, germaloids, scherproct, GTN. None of these worked and I had rubber band ligation on three internal haemorrhoids during a colonoscopy in September 2022, all else was normal. Colorectal surgeon saw a fissure and mucousal prolapse prior to colonoscopy.

I had my follow-up with the colorectal surgeon in February 2023 where he found one fissure and a scar where another was. fissure hasn’t been improving dispute creams like Diltiazem. I am currently on a waiting list for Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) and Botox injections. 
I haven’t received any appointment for it yet unfortunately due to long wait lists in the NHS. 

I am suffering with the pain and am frequently constipated, despite trying laxatives when it gets really bad. I mostly open bowels once a week, though sometimes it can be two weeks without movement. My stool is usually type 1-3. 

I had a fair bit of bleeding and pain the other day and took a photo of my anus to find a second fissure had appeared. 

Is there anything else I can try until I can get the Botox treatment? It’s a struggle dealing with this especially for so long.

The night of April 7-8, my wife took some videos of me sleeping:

* 10:30pm - Approximate time I fell asleep.
* 11:02pm - My wife takes the 1st video (2 minutes), which shows me snoring and moving a lot: [YouTube: 2023-04-07 11:02pm](https://youtu.be/gZdxna69p6o) 
* 11:14pm - My wife take the 2nd video (5 minutes), which shows me snoring and moving a lot: [YouTube: 2023-04-07 11:14pm](https://youtu.be/JpaOclruhfQ) 
* 11:37pm - My wife falls asleep, according to her Amazon Halo View fitness watch.
* 12:40am - According to my Amazon Halo View fitness watch, I ""start sleeping"" at 12:40am (even though I've been asleep for over 2 hours). If this is when I stop moving as shown in the videos, then presumably my body is jerking around for over 2 hours.
* 4:05am - My wife and I both wake up and go to the bathroom. It's rare for us to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
* 4:16am - I fall back to sleep.
* 4:20am - My wife takes the 3rd video (2 minutes), which shows me sleeping restfully (less snoring, no movement): [YouTube: 2023-04-08 04:20am](https://youtu.be/PxHk-PdiUSI)
* 4:37am - My wife falls back to sleep.

My wife doesn't know if I do this every night. She tries to fall asleep before I do, because my jerky movements keep her up, preventing her from falling asleep. She says it happens often enough that she expects it, when we sleep together, if I fall asleep before she does.

I've been struggling with ""burnout"" since 2010. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, after my child was born in 2019. I take 37.5mg venlafaxine 24 hr and 50mg traZODone daily.

My doctor prescribed a take-home sleep study, but I can't pick it up for a month, and I already scheduled my follow-up appointment, but it's not for 2 months after that. I asked to be put on the wait list for any earlier appointment. If they find something, then I'd have to see a cardiologist before they can prescribe something, which will take even longer. If it is sleep apnea, I'll have to pay full price for the CPAP because I haven't met my deductible this year. Should I just buy a CPAP and try it out, while I wait for MONTHS for a prescription?

But for years now I have been getting these weird impulses that last for a short period of time. Sometimes absurd/shameful/weird thing comes into my mind and I have an intense bodily reaction to it. When this happens I could scream, growl, cuss, grab things or make weird noises. Just now my eyes rolled back into my head I started sticking my tongue out and my neck started turning like some kind of demon was manifesting inside of me and that kind of startled me so that's why I decided to write this post.

My vision can get blurry where my eyes are shaking to the left and right and random body parts will move in an odd way or I get a strong feeling that I should hit something, which I try to control. Most times I will almost hit something, but then I don't actually finish so I can somewhat control it. It has become so frequent that it sort of became normal to me and I'm sometimes not even fully aware of it happening. I will sit behind my desk at work and be making weird faces. It doesn't always occur when I have weird thoughts, but that's mostly when I notice it happening. A lot of times it just happens and I don't understand what causes it.

He wore a condom, didn't cum at all and the condom didn't break at any moment of the intercourse. After all that, on the 10th of January 2023 i had my first period after the intercourse. Less than a week later i started feeling unwell like people do in early pregnancy (nausea, vomiting, discharge, etc.), but it also was the day before my ovulation. I was stressed untill my next period came, but it definitely was shorter than my usual periods. It lasted 3 days, whilst usually they lasted around 5 days. The next period (and every other one yet), was the same, but to clear my mind i took a pregnancy test. I took it in the afternoon and it was negative.
In the last 3 days I've noticed my stomach has gotten bigger in the lower area (biggest extent yet, was today). I've been stressed out since then. I pushed the thought of pregnancy away, cause of the reasons i listed above. The next thing i suspected, was bloating because i also ate alot lately and gained 5kg within 8 months (I'm 45.5kg and around 152cm tall). I read on the internet that bloating usually results in a hard belly. To describe mine, it's partly hard and partly soft but not squishy.

I have two bulging discs (L4-L5, L5-S1) from a motor vehicle accident which occurred about 14 months ago. They have suggested a discectomy after trying a lot of other things and it's scheduled for May 3rd. They had me do a blood test and urinalysis and received the attached results. I have scheduled an appointment with my primary doc on Monday morning. Never had results like this before and not sure how worried I should be. Also, not sure if they'll allow me to have surgery or not. I haven't really been able to be active in the last 14 months. I've gained probably about 30 lbs in that time.

I haven't been feeling too bad lately. A bit fatigued but not substantially more than normal especially considering I haven't been able to do much in the last year. Was really looking forward to being on my way to recovery with this back issue. 

I'm currently taking 0.25 mg Klonopin each night for anxiety. I just started paroxetine 5mg but I was only on my 3rd day taking it when I had this blood draw. I also take 5 mg/day of amlodipine for hypertension.

Hi there,

Since several years ago, it happens to me that I fall slightly sick almost on a weekly basis. 
I am taking about headaches, sore throat, runny nose, general weakness, sometimes cough and very, very, very occasionally slight fever. Nothing that would require even a visit to the  doctor and that cannot be solved with Paracetamol, but that is so recurrent that is frustrating to the point workmates make jokes saying that ""I am always sick"". 

I asked my GP and we run some labs some time ago, but besides some minor iron deficit, nothing that could explain the symptoms. We also tested for Lyme, and other similar viruses with no results.

Besides my GERD due to sliding hiatale hernia, I am overall a quite healthy person in mid 30s that exercises regularly, does not drink a lot, has never smoked nor done drugs and eats a normal diet. Since I was born, I have leukocytosis, but multiple hematologist told me there is nothing wrong with it. 

I evidently don't expect anyone here to tell me precisely what I have, but if anyone could at least provide some ideas or direction for me to discuss with my GP it would be amazing because we are clueless and besides asking me to take OTC supplements for inmune defense she has long ran out of ideas. a",t2_5qvqncb0,0,Getting sick on almost a weekly basis,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tf4me,True,Satrapa2010,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tf4me/getting_sick_on_almost_a_weekly_basis/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tf4me/getting_sick_on_almost_a_weekly_basis/,476160,1682024718,0,,False,1682024728,1682024729,2023-04-20 21:05:18,,,

494,AskDocs,"Hi y’all, I normally would just do a Google search but I couldn’t find anything useful there. 3 weeks ago, I think it was March 30th, I got sunburned while with my Grandmother at the beach. This isn’t atypical for me as I am a ginger in the southern US, so I have a fair amount of experience with sunburns growing up. I put sunscreen on but after a dip in the water I forgot to reapply and ended up getting sunburned. I know I need to be conscientious about it, and I usually am, but sometimes it slips my mind. Anyway it wasn’t a bad sunburn, no blisters or anything like that, just redness, stiffness, and mild pain. It was only on my face, neck, arms, and lower thighs. 

Cut to 3 weeks later and I’ve peeled and there’s no pain whatsoever. My skin doesn’t seem to be any drier than normal, and my face looks just as ruddy as it usually does. On my neck arms and legs, however, I’m still visibly red. It’s not quite as red as the days immediately after the burn, but it’s close and doesn’t seem to be fading. 

This has never happened to me before in my vast experience with my eternal enemy (The Sun), and I’m worried the dastard might have permanently scarred me. I doubt there’s anything wrong health-wise, but it does look fairly silly. 

Can anything be done to remedy this crimson curse, or is sanguinity simply my life now?

495,AskDocs,"First off, sorry if this is long winded, I've never posted on reddit before and I'm just trying to list anything that feels relevant.

I (24f) was told I was allergic to anesthetics after getting my tonsils removed when I was 7. According to the doctor, my throat became red and swollen and I woke up during the procedure (yes I am a redhead &amp; no I don't remember what it was like to wake up during surgery). I don't think / remember if my family was told what kind of anesthetics they used, they just said I had a reaction and I was allergic to anesthesia / anesthetics. Because of this, I've gone my whole life saying ""I was told I'm allergic to anesthesia, but I don't know what kind"" anytime a doctor asks about allergies. After reading posts on reddit about anesthesia allergies, I know that it's extremely rare and in most cases the reaction was probably from something else during the procedure.

Recently though, I've been looking back on my life and realizing that anytime I took numbing cough drops or numbing throat spray, they didn't work. My throat would feel worse and itchier after taking them, but as a kid I didn't think anything of it, other than it didn't work so I never said anything.

Also mosquito bites swell up into painful, excruciatingly itchy welts on me (&amp; nothing works to relieve this), so in the summer of 2015, my legs were covered in bites and welts and my sister had Dermaplast spray from just giving birth. My mom told to try spraying it on my legs for some relief, but almost immediately after spraying it on, my legs became swollen, red, and even itchier. 

(For both the dermaplast and cough drops / numbing sprays, my family never really connected the dots that I maybe shouldn't have taken them.)

The only time I can think of that I don't remember having, or a doctor reporting that I didn't have any kind of reaction to numbing medication was in about 2011 when I needed staples in the back of my head after a fall. It is very blurry in my memory, but I do remember them giving me a shot before the staples, and they didn't report any kind of reaction, but I have no idea what the shot was. (Also the same people refused to cut my hair for the staples and subsequently missed a spot that later turned into a puncture wound so who knows if there was a reaction unreported.)

I've never been to an allergist, but I've been thinking of going (if insurance covers it / I can afford it). Would they be the right kind of doctor to ask about this? Or would an anesthesiologist  be better? Do allergists typically test anesthesia / anesthetics allergies since it is so rare? Also is there a possibility that my reaction during the tonsillectomy is related to the reactions to numbing cough drops, dermaplast, etc. or is it more likely a coincidence?

Any professional opinions or thoughts would be super helpful and appreciated.

My daughter had surgery March 31st to remove a metal plate from a previously broken arm. We attended the wound clinic on the 11th and the wound had not closed either end, so the nurse put on sterile strips to bring each end together and said to leave it on for another week, then soak the strips and take them off. She said if it had still not come together to call and make another appointment. 
My daughter finally let me take the dressing off tonight after soaking it and I don't know if this has come together or if it needs medical attention?
Will that stitch be able to come away on it's own or will it need cutting.

The pain is under my big toe on the ball of my foot, but ever so slightly to the side towards the top of my foot. It hurts a lot to flex my big toe, bending hurts but not nearly as bad. It's painful to the touch if I press with a moderate pressure and hurts when I'm not using it. It still hurts a week later, probably because it's hard for me to stay off it. I've been icing a lot.

508,AskDocs,"Hi medical professionals, I have been having this dull pain in the area pointed to in my photo for the last 2/3 weeks on and off. I wouldn’t describe it as a stomach ache or chest pain it’s just in this very specific place. It doesn’t really feel muscular because it happens just kind of randomly, it’s not super sore, it just hits me at random times. It doesn’t happen when I move or do anything special. It’s very much random. It’s on my right side (just to clarify the photo). 

I have been having some heart burn the last couple of days which is new and unusual for me, I would never normally get that so perhaps it’s just indigestion? I am very bloated the last few weeks too. 

Bowel movements are normal. Having slight difficulty passing urine, not painful but there’s some pressure there and it feels like my bladder is full but I can’t quite empty it. 

I have slight lower right back pain aswell, I get kidney infections more regularly than I probably should and it kind of feels like the start of one of them. Again, I’m not sure how related that is. 

I’m not a drinker or smoker, I take an snri for anxiety and do have a past history of acetaminophen abuse and overdoses, though that was a long time ago and my mental health is stable. 

I am overweight, 5’10 , 27 Female and currently living in northern Spain.

Hi Reddit,

I've  (american, age 29) been unemployed for about a year and never thought  to get medical insurance.  Recently I discovered I'm having partial  retrograde ejaculation (it ends up in the bladder) about a month ago.   Fear of infertility has been flipping my world upside down.  Haven't  fapped since, but have noticed lately I'm having cloudy pee and just  feel weird pressure.  No pain, and peeing is relatively normal, just  feels a little strange when starting to pee.  I'm assuming I have some  issue with my prostate or bladder, what should I do?  Should I sign up  for medicare/medicaid?   Or hurry to get a new job and use their  insurance?  And should I go directly to a urologist, or some other kind  of doctor?  Thank you greatly for any answers.",t2_9nchk00tm,0,Bladder problems? No insurance?

A week ago I developed this rash that was located mostly in my tattoo and I thought it may be an allergic reaction to the ink despite it being a decade old.  I tried Benadryl and topical antihistamine creams but it did little to nothing.

The rash just kept spreading, and is red, blister like bumps that itch.  My skin is warm to the touch in the areas where it is very concentrated.

I have an appointment next week with my PCP  but what can I do to give relief?  I’ve tried eczema lotions, antihistamine lotions, oral antihistamines and nothing is helping.

I started developing scalp psoriasis around the age of 12. It definitely has its flare ups—especially in the drier colder months and definitely when my stress levels go up. When it used to be at its worst, it still was isolated to my scalp but would begin to creep down my forehead and down my neck/behind ears. It’s relatively manageable on my scalp after testing different medicated shampoos and conditioners over the years. However, just in the last 3-6 months, I have noticed it mildly on my elbows and rapidly getting worse on my legs (specifically below the knee). My father has psoriasis as well as my sister. Dad takes methotrexate to manage his and it works very well for him—he had a massive plaque that looked basically like a shin guard on his left leg for 10+ years and now there is just minimal scarring since being on meds. I’m concerned about going on an immunosuppressant ever since the pandemic but topical steroids do absolutely nothing for the patches I’m getting on my legs. It’s embarrassing visually—I absolutely hate having my legs exposed now—and has reached the point where the itching and burning is waking me up multiple times throughout the night. Will post a comment with pic of the worst spot on my leg.

Essentially what I’m asking for here is advice on how to get a dermatologist referral and what I should be prepared to hear in terms of options..I have a great PCP but she is booked until October and won’t give me a referral without seeing her in person. with warmer months approaching and a growing lack of sleep I want to get this addressed ASAP. Again, immunosuppressant medication is the last option I want to go for but if it’s the most effective way to keep my hair from falling out or my skin getting even more gross and uncomfortable I’ll certainly consider.

Is it true that babies can't be vegan? We asked to see a dietician to help us ensure that we are providing our daughter with everything she needs, especially since she will turn one in May. The dietician checked her zinc and iron levels and found that her zinc is perfect, but she has low-level anemia. Her b-12 levels were not checked. They advised us that raising our daughter vegan could end up harming her, and recommended that we start feeding her meat, dairy, and eggs. We suggested supplementing her diet with iron and B12 supplements, but they told us that no doctor would support raising a child vegan.

It's important to note that our daughter was born full-term but was IGUR, and was in the 1st percentile for height and weight when born. However, she has now reached the 5th percentile for both and has hit all of her developmental milestones, including standing on her own recently. She is currently breastfed and we had been feeding her foods such as tofu, beans, lentils, smoothie bowls with dark greens, and nut butters, just to name a few. 

We would like a second opinion and have scheduled to speak with another doctor in May.

Is it true that vegan children are not healthy which is what is being told to us.

He then referred me to an Opthamologist, and they were able to get me in this coming Tuesday for the appointment.

1. Because Glaucoma is rare for a person within my age group, are there serious underlying conditions that could be causing my narrow angles (Lymphoma, Leukemia, etc)?
2. If narrow angles are caused by the above diseases, is it more probable for a person my age to have Glaucoma, or another disease of which narrow angles are just a side effect/symptom?
3. What should I expect at the Ophthalmologist on Tuesday?

basically my problem is for the last 2-3 weeks I’ve been suffering with severe anxiety throughout the day and panic attacks and insomnia throughout the night, which have led to me sleeping on average about 3-4h per night and only eating around an average of 1000-1200 calories per day, i believe the cause of my anxiety/panic attacks and insomnia is stress about college and finding an apprenticeship, I only mention this because I feel like I should point out I have done everything in my power to resolve the cause of my anxiety and insomnia (looking/applying for apprenticeships ect) but have been unsuccessful so I know that it is just a case of having to wait and see what happens now.

Until yesterday I tried to just work through it on my own with breathing exercises ect but nothing was working so yesterday (Tuesday) morning I made an emergency appointment with my gp (general practitioner) and explained to her the issues I was having, she prescribed the propanolol for my anxiety/panic attacks and the phenergan for my insomnia, I do feel like the phenergan is somewhat working as it is sending me to sleep but I do still keep waking up through the night, for example yesterday the first pill I took was a propranolol this was as soon as I collected my prescription roughly 10:30am, I then came home from college around 4pm I had a bath, got changed ect and at about 5pm I took 1 of the phenergan pills after about 30min I fell asleep however i then woke up at around 00:30am and could not get back to sleep for about 30-45min so I took another of the phenergan as I had read the leaflet and it said that it was safe to take up to 50mg (2 pills per night) I also took another one of the propranolol pills because when I read the leaflet for that earlier in the day I saw that it completely wears of after around 8h and I had took my first one roughly 14h before that so i think that is why I kept waking up because the propranolol had wore off, so at this point it was some time around 1:30am and I fell back to sleep and didn’t wake up until 3:30pm today.

However even though I slept that long I can still remember waking up multiple times while I was asleep, obviously I will discuss all of this with my gp when I go back for a check up in the next week or so but I was just hoping to get some other opinions, I think that the phenergan that she gave me for my insomnia is working fine but I need a stronger anxiety medication because I have still been experiencing severe anxiety through the day, to be clear it isn’t as bad as it has been for the last couple of weeks but it is still very noticeably there, I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what medication could better treat my condition and also what would be the best way to suggest this to my gp (I don’t want to come across as one of those people that reads an article on the internet and thinks they know better than someone with x years of experience and training), any advise would be very much appreciated thank you in advance.",t2_rt1qtddd,0,Anxiety and insomnia medication,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tdixd,True,ymxbgq,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tdixd/anxiety_and_insomnia_medication/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tdixd/anxiety_and_insomnia_medication/,476147,1682021261,0,,False,1682021278,1682021279,2023-04-20 20:07:41,,,

I’ve had recurring abdominal/stomach pain for 4 months now. I went to my GP originally after 2 weeks and was prescribed Omeprazole and was told it was Gastritis. This medication had little effect. Once after working a night shift I passed a really dark sticky stool and I was concerned there could be blood so I contacted the GP again about 2 weeks after being on Omeprazole. This time I was referred for an urgent endoscopy and told to continue the Omeprazole until 2 weeks before the procedure. I had the endo about 3 weeks later - I was told everything looked normal in my stomach and duodenum. A biopsy was taken to test for H. pylori but came back negative. After the procedure I followed up with my GP who prescribed Lansoprazole, another type of PPI. I took this for 1 month with little effect. I once again contacted my GP who advised I keep taking the medication and also took some blood for a tTg-IgA Coeliac disease test (also negative). Another few weeks have passed and I’m still have the pain. I struggle to sleep as overnight the pain moves into my back, because of this I now have an lower eyelid eye twitch which has persisted for a few weeks now.

Hi -

I posted some time back about my 5th metatarsal break. After 2 months, I'd like to  to see if someone can advise whether the current doctor's advice makes sense.

I wore a short boot for around 7 weeks. Doctor said i am now fine to walk in a tennis sneaker full-time, which I am.

After 2 months, I still feel some soreness, tightness, numbness, throbbing, and tingling near the injury, especially when sitting still or lying down. Pain is not intense, but not sure if it is expected. Doc said I can walk without the boot now and after another month resume normal activities. X-ray (see below) still shows the fracture but some healing. But he says it’s 80% healed. Im nervous, but taking his direction. He said the fracture won’t close in the X-ray for another 3 months, and said at my age (51), healing does take longer. He says little by little the pain will get less, and that I should just take a NSAID when I feel pain. 

Thank you for reviewing, and please let me know if you need further context.

I constantly feel like I have to gag, and it's hard to speak without needing to stop often so that I don't gag. 

The constant discomfort has impacted my quality of life profoundly. I don't go out much to see my friends, or even call them on the phone because of how uncomfortable it is to talk. I've become completely isolated because of this. It's hard to concentrate on anything, and relaxation is impossible. What options do I have? We've floated around the idea of a uvulvectomy, but I'm not sure if the uvula is the (only) issue, or if it's my soft palate/both. A UPPP would be a more extreme option, but is that excessive? Do people recover well from uvulectomies/UPPP's? I'm afraid this is just how it feels now, and don't know if I can live with that.",t2_1zreg08o,0,Non-stop gagginess and throat discomfort 1.5 years after throat surgery,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12tcg9c,True,andsoonandso,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12tcg9c/nonstop_gagginess_and_throat_discomfort_15_years/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12tcg9c/nonstop_gagginess_and_throat_discomfort_15_years/,476145,1682019052,0,,False,1682019067,1682019067,2023-04-20 19:30:52,,,

HISTORY: Left shoulder pain.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR of the left shoulder was performed without intravenous contrast.

COMPARISON: none.

FINDINGS:

Labrum is grossly intact given nonarthrographic technique. There is mild tendinopathy of intra-articular biceps tendon without tear.

Glenohumeral alignment is normal. No fracture or subluxation is seen. There is no evidence of osteonecrosis. There is minimal acromioclavicular osteoarthrosis. The acromion is mildly laterally downsloping and type II in configuration
causing mild encroachment upon the cuff.

There is mild tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon with linear intrasubstance tear at the insertion measuring 8 mm AP and 3 mm lateral and sagittal image 16 and coronal image 10. No full-thickness or retracted tear is seen. There is no muscle atrophy. Infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons are
intact.

There is minimal glenohumeral joint fluid. There is trace subacromial, subdeltoid fluid. No subcutaneous edema or soft tissue mass is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1.    Mild tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon with linear intrasubstance tear at the insertion. No full-thickness or retracted tear. No muscle atrophy.
2.    Mild tendinopathy of intra-articular biceps tendon without tear.
3.    Laterally downsloping and type II acromion causes encroachment upon the cuff.

My daughter started experiencing a lot of fevers summer 2022 that come and go.

She saw her doctor in Immunology and Rheumatology who sent many tests. The fevers start 99-100 and then got higher up to 101-102 degrees. She also gets night sweats that soak her sheets and shirt/pant and a red weird splotchy rash. She also has chronic urticaria and is getting xolair. Many tests like ESR and CRP came back only slightly elevated…highest ESR was 51 and CRP was also 16.3. They also did some flow cytometry test for cancer on her which came fine. 

Her lymphs on blood test are only a little elevated like 4.80 k/ul and white blood cells only little high almost normal 10.84 k/ul. Her doctor says there is some inflammation but still don’t know what’s going on. All blood culture came back negative like hiv, tuberculosis, hepatitis b/c. Even checked rheumatoid factor, some ccp igG test, soluble il2 test and anti neutrophil antibody test which came negative. 

ana was also negative.

They did many genetic tests which didn’t come back with anything except 2 variants (i think it was C1S and kmt2d). 

She started 15mg prednisone in january and it has been helping. Still some fevers sometime here and there but doing better. but no answers…

Doctor are looking at taking her off of prednisone and repeating tests to see if they can find anything. She has been to many specialists and poor girl is in college trying to make up schoolwork...

Medications - Blisovi fe 1/20

Diagnoses - Uterine Fybriods, discovered 3 years ago due to er stay from blood loss, treated with a uterine fibroid embolization. Achalaisa, had surgery just under 2 years ago.

 
My girlfriend started taking blisovi fe 1/20 about 2mo ago. She hasn't had a period since her surgery for the fibriods and her NP suggested starting birth control to get her to have periods again. 

Her 3 weeks taking the active pills she had some occasional nausea but nothing to bad, as well as feeling down/depressed more often without reason. First week on the placebos she started bleeding on the 3rd day but it was very light and didn't pick up much. By her estimation it was just a few ml, 20ml at max.

 On the second 3 weeks of active pills things were worse. She was experiencing nausea almost daily and it was sometimes bad enough to be affecting her ability to get her work/school done. She also started having diarrhea regularly at the end of week 2. Now she is on her 5th day of placebos and her symptoms have significantly increased. The nausea is every day for most or all of the day, diarrhea regularly, feeling sad/depressed more days than not(she has struggled with depression,  undiagnosed, since her fibriods surgery, but it has gotten worse), loss of appetite, faintness and weakness. She bleeding a very small amount Tuesday, nothing Wednesday, and small amount today(more than Tuesday).

Potentially unrelated problems. She has always had a problem with feeling tired during the day but it seems to have gotten worse since starting birth control. She hasn't been able to sleep for long periods starting sometime in the second set of active pills, this has progressed to the point that this week she hasn't stayed asleep for more than 4 hours at a time usually close to 2hrs. Despite that she is sleeping alot, 10+ hours, just split up alot. She claims that this week its just like that becuase I'm gone on work and she can't sleep well alone. 

Are these normal symptoms? Should she see a doctor about this sooner than her scheduled appointment with her np(in 1mo)? Is there anything she can do to help reduce the symptoms (I've tried to get her to take meclizine to help with naseua but she isn't to fond of taking medication)

She doesn't like going to the doctor and keeps putting off going. With both her fibriods and achalaisa she waited for it to be a serious life threatening problem to seek treatment. Her experiences with those being treated were very negative also. She is worried if she goes to the doctor she will learn something else is wrong with her and says she can't handle something else after those two.

About a year ago I separated my ac joint was only a type 1 separation but ever since then everything has gotten worse. My collar bone is very wiggly and my shoulder almost feels dislocated I get a lot of pain on the front of my neck above and behind my collarbone almost like a burning zap feeling. I also have numbness on the back right side of my neck that runs down behind my shoulder blade. i have also noticed that where my lat inserts into my arm near the tricep shoulder area it is very painful, when I hang from a bar a nerve shoots down the side of my lat across my ribs. I am getting an ultrasound soon but everything is taking so long. I’m really worried I will never be able to go back to the gym again. It’s been over a year and I’ve lost over 20 pounds. I’m trying to do light exercise but my shoulder is in very bad condition. I saw a shoulder specialist but that was about 4 months ago and the only imaging he had was my ultrasound and he wasn’t impressed. But fast forward to now my shoulder is 3 times worse than how it started. The things that concern me the most is the nerve pain as well as I’ve read that there are important veins running behind the collar bone and I can literally wiggle it with my fingers. Anything you recommend I do waiting for my ultra sound. If I had to guess I would say I have a very unstable sc joint as well as maybe a small tear somewhere in my shoulder and maybe a trapped nerve.

Pain seems to be provoked by hip flexion and external rotation. The pain first occurred when I first started weight lifting, onset slowly, and is not associated with any injury. Pain is accompanied by popping or snapping in the deep gluteal region, specifically when flexing glutes while sitting, and snapping around the front of the hip during hip flexion, such as during leg lifts.

I’ve gone to several orthopedic specialists, a physical medicine specialist, and have had a variety of imaging done with no answers. MRIs on my spine and an arthrogram on my hip have come back clear. I’ve been seeing a physical therapist for the past year and have had several working diagnoses which haven’t panned out.

* Sciatica due to herniated disc (cleared by MRI)
* Femoroacetabular impingement (cleared by MRI and physical exam)
* Ischiofemoral impingement (not evident on MRI, cleared by physical exam)

It was abrupt and came right back, but when it happened I thought I felt a static come over me for a moment. It startled me initially, but I went back to working. It wasn't a zap or shock, but like a subtle feeling of static.

I doubt this was electric shock...it would be more noticeable, right? Like an actual large zap, right?

It's been about 3 hours since then, and I recently developed a headache - after lunch. And every now and then I have a twinge of pain in my neck/shoulders area.

Sometimes when I move my head, I hear some crackling - not like static really, it is probably related to my ears because when I run, I sometimes hear clicking.

I'm trying to get a read from a med professional who knows about the results of a vasectomy.

Sperm Count Post Vasectomy, HPF 

Your Value: 0-3 Sperm /HPF

Standard Range: 0-3 Sperm/HPF

Spermatozoa, Motile % Post Vasectomy, High Power Field: Non-Motile

I asked my doc about the results, and I got the following response - ""This means that no viable sperm were seen in the sample. You are essentially considered sterile.""

I followed up with a question about if 0-3 Sperm/HPF is the best I will ever get, or if I should hope for a 0 Sperm/HPF. He didn't answer my question but rather said that we can test again in a month so I am 100% confident.

I already had a second test planned, and I hear them when they say I am \*essentially\* sterile. But, when it comes to possible pregnancies, I have questions about ""essentially"" sterile and 0-3 and not 0.

I'm just trying to get my question answered. I can follow up with the doc again, but he didn't answer my question last time, so I am looking elsewhere also. If anyone has knowledge, thanks.

- on the right of my skull at the bottom there is a bump that has progressively gotten bigger. It produces a dull pain. Now it has physical pain when I touch it.
- balance issues
- visual obstructions such as flashes, seeing spots, blurred vision
- fatigue (I have 2 kids under 2 so really hard to say whether the fatigue is caused by a medical issue and/or my life circumstances).
- pretty sure I had a mini stroke in my last year of highschool, the doctor didn’t believe me and attributed it to drugs. I never did drugs. Then he concluded it was my symbicort for asthma (I don’t believe that would cause what would seem like a mini stroke).
- my wisdom tooth again on my right side is coming in and if I press against the gum where it is I can physically cause my hemafacial spasms.
Same with that tender spot on the back of my head if I press that I can cause the spasms.

595,AskDocs,"Hi there, I am a 33 year old female with MS and am on immune suppressing injections that I take every four weeks, started them in early November. I was diagnosed nearly 8 years ago and have been on a few different immune suppressing treatments over the years. Thankfully despite this I haven’t had any issues with vaginal thrush, until recently. On 3rd March I woke up on holiday with very bad thrush symptoms and immediately went to a chemist and sorted a Fluconazole 150mg tablet. I hoped this would get rid of it but when I returned from holiday a few days later I still had symptoms. I rang my GP who immediately began me on a two week course of Fluconazole 50mg a day as she said it was needed with my weakened immune system. Swabs confirmed it was thrush. Long story short since then I have had several courses of fluconazole including 150mg every three days for a week, several pessarys of Clotrimazole 500mg and it still hasn’t gone away. Symptoms at the beginning were severe and for a while now they have been milder but despite ongoing treatment the thrush is still there. I paid to go private and see a gynaecologist a couple weeks ago who examined me etc but unfortunately told me and gave me the same things as the GP which was disappointing. I have also been taking probiotics for vaginal flora for a few weeks and have been reducing my sugar intake. I spoke to my ms team who told me to miss this month’s injection to see if that helps me fight it off, it was meant to be done a couple nights ago so I didn’t take it. I live in the UK and the treatments I have mentioned are the only ones that exist for thrush so I am getting really worried. Also worth mentioning that a GP said to me that even with having a weakened immune system she has never known someone to not have their thrush go away with these treatments which didn’t make me feel much better! I have heard of re-occurring thrush but there is nothing online about thrush that despite treatment doesn’t go away. Dealing with this on top of my MS is starting to take a toll on my mental health.

Fort Worth Texas, USA 

I am documenting these symptoms here, as I find it easier to express myself in writing. On July 28th, 2022, I began experiencing what I believe to be repetitive strain injury in my hands, fingers, and arms bilaterally. Two months later, my wrists started hurting severely due to excessive typing and a combination while lifting weights while having rsi. My doctor conducted an EMG, suspecting both ulnar and carpal entrapment, even though the test only indicated ulnar entrapment. I underwent bilateral surgeries for both issues.

However, from September until now, I have developed additional symptoms:

* Burning, shooting pain, and sensitivity in my fingertips
* Occasional tingling in my left foot
* Persistent hand pain, leading me to try a foot mouse, which resulted in right ankle tendon injury
* Using insoles then led to left ankle tendon injury; both ankle injuries have persisted for months, sometimes improving and then worsening again
* Concurrently, I began experiencing other unusual symptoms:

Left shoulder falling asleep when lying on my back

* Big toe mainly numb and the other four tingling on the left side
* Left side of the face feeling numb or partially tingling
* Tingling and shooting pain from left foot up to the left kneecap and back of the calf
* Burning sensation in both arms and hands
* Persistent ankle pain and slow healing of inflammation
* Heavy or strained feeling at the back of the neck, especially on the right side
* Experiencing a sensation of falling in my sleep and odd mental feelings while on steroids
* Fatigue after eating and a strange sensation in my mouth while chewing, like it wants to lock or feels pressure on the roof of my mouth
* Occasional episodes of brain fog that eventually subside
* Pressure sensation on the left side of the head when lying on the right side
* Numbness in the head occurring only when lying down and falling asleep
* Fingers and arms, especially the right arm near the radial area, burning when typing, and even more when bending my arms tightly

These symptoms often vary from day to day, and sometimes I experience a two-week period with no upper body issues, only for them to return the following week. However, the pain in my arms and hands is constant. Other changes include thinning of my left eyebrow hair and a sudden onset of facial psoriasis. Since my injury, my blood pressure has consistently been elevated, and I have experienced hypertension. My A1C is 5.6, which is borderline pre-diabetic, with a glucose level of 105 and an insulin level of 16 I suspect pre-diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy but am unsure of what is happening. Additionally, I consulted a chiropractor and underwent an X-ray of my neck. The chiropractor informed me that I have a military neck spine, which could potentially be causing nerve issues in my neck. It is also possible that adrenal issues could be contributing to my symptoms, especially considering the steroids I have been taking. Before last year i have always been healthy. I have tried explaining this to various medical professionals, but the situation remains unexplained and seems to be progressively worsening, particularly on my left side.",t2_7cabf5xm,0,What do I have??,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12t9ukw,True,Unable_Count_1635,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12t9ukw/what_do_i_have/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12t9ukw/what_do_i_have/,476130,1682013828,0,,False,1682013840,1682013841,2023-04-20 18:03:48,,,

Anyways, Sunday morning I woke up and took a sip of water at my desk and broke out in hives. It lasted 3 hours and only affected my neck and face. 

Later that night, I broke out in hives again, but this time I was having some throat swelling, so I ended up going to the ER, they weren’t able to see me after two hours, and the attack went down, so I ended up going home without being seen, 

Went to my primary the very next day, and he prescribed me Zyrtec, and a higher dose of famotidine. 

Anyways, since that second break out, my face keeps drying out and burning, I can’t put on any face lotion without it burning, and I tried a few different brands.

PMHx: GAD, Panic disorder, BED 

Current issue: weekly, 1-2x per week diarrhea post-dinner which started 3 weeks ago. Has happened in the past and caused great anxiety, but eventually went away. No clear food link, due to restrictive eating patterns during my current diet period, I eat pretty much the same thing for dinner most days (meat, veggies and rice). The diarrhea has only ever come after dinner. Where I feel a bit bloated, hear my stomach rumbling &amp; the BM comes within an hour or two. Then only lasts for 1-2 BMs. No issue after that. 

My typical BM is after my morning oatmeal &amp; coffee everyday. They’re almost always firm. I rarely eat a big lunch, typically very small if anything - but no problems there either. 

Added context:

- anxiety may/may not play a role, as I did have a fear of IBD previously and diarrhea definitely triggers that (and has been triggered the past few weeks). 

- my eating is currently in a very restrictive phase (1-1.2K calories per day id guess).

606,AskDocs,"First, thank you a thousand times for reading this and trying to help. 

Second, we made an appointment with the plastic surgeon who removed the cyst a year ago, at the children hospital next week, but I am still asking this question here is because I want to hear your professional opinion based on experience. 

Okay, so a little background. When our son was 4/5 months old I discovered he had a small bump on the right side of his head. The size of small corn correl I would say. The paediatrician suspected Langerhans cel hystiocitose, a rare cancer, due to the eczema on his legs. Thank goodness the childrens oncologist told us (after examining the photo and echos) that it was likely a epidermoid cyst. She referred us back to the paediatrician and he suggested to leave it as it is. 
I didn’t take that for an answer, because we were very concerned about the place of this cyst, on his head and were afraid it would affect his neurological development. I managed to get a second opinion from a children’s dermatologist and she immediately suggested us to get it removed by the time our son turns 1. He was 9 months old when she suggested this. 
So, we did. After the surgery the plastic surgeon told us the cyst was removed completely and the chance that it will return is close to zero. That is why we won’t need any follow up check ups. The laboratory examined the tissue and said there are no malign signs. Now , more than a year later my son gets chicken pox and some were on his head. I felt the side of his head and on the same spot I felt this bump again. A bit smaller than the original one, based on my memory, but now I am very very concerned, terrified actually because of the initial diagnosis of this paediatrician regarding Langerhans cel hystiocytose. I guess my question is.. based on this (my son is developing and growing well), what could it be? And how can it grow so fast?",t2_1nyj4s1c,0,My 2 year old son had an epidermoid cyst (on the head) removed surgically when he was 1 year old.

607,AskDocs,"Hi there,

I (29M, 220 lbs, 5 ft 3) was diagnosed with fatty liver at the end of 2021 after a routine blood test, followed by ultrasound. ALT and GGT were slightly elevated at the time (I’ll post all liver enzyme results for 2021/2022/2023 at the end). In April 2022, after giving up alcohol for 3 months, another round of blood tests showed no change really with the ultrasound result: 

“The liver is of diffusely increased echogenicity, suggestive of hepatic steatosis with areas of focal fatty sparing seen adjacent to the gallbladder. The portal vein is patent. Normal sonographic appearance of the gallbladder without gallstones. Normal calibre of the common bile duct. Normal sonographic appearance of the visualised pancreas, kidneys and spleen. The body and tail of the pancreas were obscured by overlying bowel gas. Normal calibre of the aorta.”

For various reasons since then I have not lost any weight (actually gained some). I plan to change this in 2023 after my honeymoon. I have cut back on drinking alcohol since the diagnosis but I still drink, usually only once a week at most and when I do it tends to be ~ up to 10 units (in Ireland that would be 5 pints of Guinness for example). Sometimes I drink more (I just got married, so my stag and my actual wedding) and a lot of the time I don’t drink at the weekend or I drink less. I plan to stop drinking alcohol for an extended period of time after my honeymoon. 

At the end of 2021, just after the diagnosis, I noticed a very slight ache in my upper right side, where my liver is… my doctor did not seem in any way concerned and put me on a PPI for 2 weeks… I do get bad heart burn if I eat bad food or drink alcohol. In April 2022 the ache was still present, coming and going… the doctor didn’t really give much explanation for this. 

Now, in 2023, the pain has gradually gotten worse, and towards the end of 2022 until now it is basically there everyday, and now I would call it painful (but not severe). Throbbing dull ache makes sense as a descriptor to me, the specific place of pain moves around but tends to be towards my upper right side (where the arm rests against your side) as opposed to in my upper front right (directly under the nipple). The pain can feel worse if I eat a lot and have a full stomach, but the pain is there whether I eat or not usually. It also can feel like there is pressure coming from inside. I had a medical at work just after my stag in February 2023 and my liver enzymes are increased again (work doctor said drinking at the stag could elevate them a bit). 

The situation now is I got married 2 weeks ago and I’m going on my honeymoon in 3 weeks, I plan to see my doctor when I return because I didn’t want to ruin the wedding and I don’t want to ruin the honeymoon if my doctor sends me for other tests (waiting for results or waiting for the tests). I’m an anxious person so this will be on my mind. However, I’m worried I am just making something worse and potentially dangerous if I leave it until then. 

Any ideas if this pain is from the liver issues? Does it sound like an ulcer or something with my colon? Is this serious enough that I absolutely should go to my doctor before the honeymoon and deal with the anxiety?

Thanks for any help!

609,AskDocs,"Please help me

I write this post after suffering a crushing defeat in the hands of my allergies. I'm unable to study, walk or even perform simple everyday activities. My quality of life has plummeted after the onset of allergies to the point I'm contemplating killing myself. Please help me!

I’m a \[26\] \[M\], 6ft Tall, 85 KG from India. It all started within a couple of months after Covid. I previously had minor allergies to dust growing up. I occasionally had a drippy nose or itchy eyes as a kid. My experience with allergies was limited to this. I tested Covid positive in 2021 in the middle of the second wave in India (which was deadly). I didn’t have any major symptoms and sailed through with a simple home quarantine. It is after a couple of months that I started to feel the debilitating effect it had on my health. I’ve developed horrible chest tightness, and abdominal discomfort and couldn’t even do simple activities like walking up the staircase without panting like a dog. 

Every time I had a meal, it felt like my lungs and stomach were on fire. My IgE levels were through the roof (Value= 4199) I suffered through breathlessness and chest tightness for over 4-5 months before my pulmonologist/allergist asked me to get a food intolerance test done. I realised that I became allergic to a lot of things I was eating at that point and drastically altered my diet. Momentarily the allergies have subsided. I was put on Montelukast (Anti-histamine) which I have used for close to a year. 2022 was relatively fine, as I didn’t experience any major allergic reactions. This was also the time I began smoking again (I smoked for 7 years- 10 cigarettes a day but I stopped for a year after becoming Covid positive). I smoked for 6 months, I went for a trek in the Himalayas. I was doing just fine. 

Jan 1st, 2023 I quit smoking again as part of the New Year’s resolution. This is where my allergies hit back with full force. I experience chest tightness, chest congestion, abdominal discomfort (acidic sensation). I’ve been put on a wide variety of anti-histamines including Montelukast, Bilastine, Allegra etc which worked for a week or two and stopped working afterwards. I’ve also been put on AB Phylline which is used to treat symptoms of asthma. Further, I’ve been prescribed an Aerocort inhaler which is kind of a Bronchodilator. I’ve been put on probiotics also. None of them seems to help my chest tightness or breathlessness. 

I’m unable to speak a full sentence without gasping for breath. I suspected a pollen allergy or some other air-borne allergen and got an air purifier for my house and locked myself in my room. It reduced my allergies probably by 15-20 per cent. My doctor consistently said my lungs are fine i.e. there is no evidence of any damage etc, my SPo2 levels are fine too. He is hesitant to prescribe me any steroids because he says they’ll have long-term effects. After he gave me hope for two years that this will go away, today he said I need to “move on” and probably seek a second opinion because he exhausted all treatment options. He has also been very hesitant to opt for immunotherapy because he says if my IgE levels don’t come down, it won’t work (the value is still above 2500 two days ago).  I don’t know what to do at this point. Please help me brothers/sisters, I’m really desperate to find a solution to this problem.

Two days ago, I first noticed 2 small but hard bumps on the palm and smallest finger of my right hand... They do not itch, but they do hurt when i touch them. They look like they have water inside them. I thought it was normal maybe because I touched something dirty... Last night, i found i had a lot of bumps all over my body, which i thought was just body acne that i normally have.

Today, my face is also filled with bumps that look like a ton of large pimples... I think I may have chicken pox, but I've already had it when I was younger. 

I also have them on my arms, i think on my back, some on my legs, and on my scalp too because i felt a burning sensation when i applied shampoo while showering. 

I will be telling my parents this tomorrow morning (plus its quite obvious on my face). It is 2am now and i cannot go to a dermatologist / doctor at this moment. 

I am not allergic to anything, and i have not eaten anything that is new to me in the past few weeks.

I have always had a pretty bad memory. Both long term memory and short term/working memory. However, lately I feel like it’s been getting worse. Sometimes simple things I have to really think about. Last night I was thinking about how old I was and even trying to calculate it based on what year I was born took me a few minutes. Ive been losing track of some conversations partway through. I have always had to make sure to put most of my “to-do” things/appointments or even just basic things I want or need to remember in my reminders on my phone, but I feel lately that I’ve had to do that more and more, and with more little things. I know that anxiety/ADHD/sleep apnea can be a contributing factor for memory issues, but would that be a reason for the sudden progression? It’s starting to really concern me. I do consider myself a bit of a hypochondriac but I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting or not.

**Tl;dr is average heart rate 186 too high for a new runner? I’m freaking myself out due to a tragic family history.**

I’ve recent picked up running. I’m really not running far or fast, yesterday I ran 2.3 miles in 20 minutes on the treadmill. Usually run 4-5 times a week 15-20 minutes at this pace or a little slower (9 to 9:30 minute miles) and warm up with 10 minutes walking 20 minute mile pace at a significant incline for the past couple months. 

According to my Apple Watch, my average heart rate was 186 and I was above 179 for the entire 20 minutes. The highest my heart reached was 191 (Ive seen it go as high as 195 on a different run and slowed down). This is very typical for my runs. I don’t feel faint/dizzy and like I could keep going if I really wanted to push myself. Resting heart rate is 70-75 

The men on my dad’s side of the family typically die from heart attacks age 50-60. My dad passed away a little under two years ago at 52. He was very active, went into cardiac arrest coming back from his daily run. He was a daily drinker. The doctors said based on scarring, he had three or four heart attacks before the one that stopped his heart (never went to the doctor for the other ones or never told us.) 

I want to get in shape to better my heart health even though this problem doesn’t seem to affect the women. My dad had no sisters and one female cousin from that side who is a daily runner and slim (and alive lol) so there’s not really a big enough sample size to know if it’s gonna happen to me. 

**What I want to know is if I should slow down until I can run at a more reasonable heart rate or if this is normal for someone just starting out. I don’t want to damage my heart when the whole point is to make it stronger so I can live longer.**

620,AskDocs,"I (24F) am experiencing severe lower back pain that has been getting worse very quickly over the last couple of months. The back pain is not manageable by hot pads or over the counter medications, and it has been affecting my balance and coordination. I often get a very sharp pinch feeling in my lower back when I stand up, and my legs go numb. I'm having a lot of trouble with stairs, my knees feel unsteady and my legs shake, I feel like my back is going to crumble and I'll fall again. 

I've gone from hiking and running to not being able to walk in a straight line without stumbling or making it up or down the stairs by myself in less than a year.

I'm having other symptoms that make me afraid of MS, as I meet the criteria, but I'm hoping it's something else that's not as bad. 

I just got new insurance, so I scheduled an appointment with a new primary care provider, but they can't get me in until late June, and won't see me sooner because I am a new patient. 

I don't know if I can wait that long considering how fast this is worsening with no answers, and am contemplating the emergency room if it gets worse- but most people, myself included, can't afford that.

For my birthday very recently I wanted to go on a morning hike with a friend and the hike ended in a cave where a lot of fresh water for agriculture and the nearby village comes from. However while inside a dark part of this small cave, a bat flew extremely close to my arm. I don't remember if it actually touched me as I couldn't see much, but there was broken skin in the place it did (no feeling at all, no cut, no blood or anything, just the absolute most minor bit of dead skin there and a slight bit of red that could've come from anything beforehand- that's it). I don't know if this came from the bat scratching me and not noticing the feeling at all or from getting roughed up on the path up the mountain but I'm freaking out a bit.

Straight to the point, I am a rad tech student, and today we were practicing at a chemotherapy department. I was changing an IV system and some blood spilled on my pointing finger; should I be worried of any potential infections? I am more than certain the patient did not have HIV cause it is almost non existent where I live, but what about hepatitis and other infections? My skin was intact, and the blood stayed for around a minute before I washed it off with rubbing alcohol. The amount of blood was centimetric(probably around 2 centimeters (half an inch)).   


  
PS. For anyone wondering why I was not wearing gloves, it is just that my country isn't the best at taking these ""smaller"" protocols to serious consideration, nonetheless, what are my chances that I contracted any viral/infectious and serious disease, and should I be doing any tests or wait for potential symptoms?

I have a pretty bad diet tbh, but I'd always been in the 120s, so I figured it was just me getting older and no longer having a teenage metabolism to sustain that. I don't eat huge portions and really only have about 2 meals a day with some snacking, since breakfast made me nauseous in high school. I don't drink full sugar soda and stick to diet when I want one, and avoid things with tons of sugar when I can. I don't go crazy drinking. Needless to say I am the least fun friend at the restaurant lmao.

Basically I went from 120 to 140 in 2020-21, 140-170 in 2021-2022, and 170-196 since Sept. 2022 to now (7 months). So almost 80lb in 3 years. Google was no help in saying what was within normal limits so here I am. I basically have stretchmarks all the way down to my knees/top of calves.

I got some blood work done and I have a high marker for ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase, 136g) that I initially thought was probably due to me gobbling Tylenol since 15 for joint pain/migraines (advil and ibuprofen don't work that well for me, only acetaminophen). However a family member mentioned that my grandmother has hypothyroidism that I wasn't aware of. I have an appointment set up to review my bloodwork with a new provider, but is this amount of weight gain over 3 years something I should bring up? Or is it within normal and I should chalk it up to me just being unhealthy and not mention it.

Age 40, female, white, low iron and take a supplement.

My symptoms are tinnitus, a very low pitch humming/buzzing. Sounds like a fridge hum. 

It stops buzzing when I move my head side to side quickly, when I walk, talk or chew and when there is any other similar frequency sound it completely silences.

Sometimes it goes silence then I only hear the buzz when I move my head side to side then it’s usually followed by complete silence for a while.

The buzzing was constant for almost 1.5 years then it went away for 10 weeks (I was seeing a Chiro and osteopath at the time but can’t be sure it’s a coincidence or not) and came back 9 days before I tested positive for covid, it was constant for a few weeks then became intermittent and I would only have it in the evenings, I would wake up to silence but as the day went on it ramped up (a suggestion was a compressed nerve that decompressed over night then when I got up and moved around it compressed again). It’s now become constant again which coincided with my son getting hand foot and mouth virus and a few bad nights of sleep for me. 

I’ve had the following tests:
Hearing tests x 3 - no hearing loss

Pain in Upper left calf

Had surgery to repair torn labrum in left hip in September 2022, did 8ish weeks of PT before returning to work at paint store. 

Had to do PT two years ago from hypermobile ankles causing sprains. Was told my calves are pretty tight.

So here is whats up. A month or so ago I think I strained my calf in some way. I was at a skating rink and was using a scooter, when I pushed off from the scooter I felt a popping sensation and my left calf felt like it had a constant charlie horse. I am out of shape from my hip surgery recovery so I thought I overdid it and needed chill for a few days. Took ibuprofen and iced it.
It took about a week before it didn't hurt. Thought I was good. However since then if I do any kind of jumping or a short light jog, my calf hurts again and gets really tight. Pain will last for a day or two and go away until I do some kind of light jog or jumping then it will come back again.
I haven't been exercising regularly and lost some muscle tone from my recovery.

I work at a paint store where I will intermittently lift 50-75lbs, and I am big on lifting properly so my legs will take the weight.

I am really frustrated because I want to get back to being in shape but now I have this injury that won't go away. Do I just need to baby it or should I be seeing an orthopedic doctor or sports medicine specialist?

Or could it be one of those situations where I need to stretch my calves out and work on flexibility or making other leg muscles stronger? I know I hurt something and I don't want to exacerbate something that might need time. I don't know where to go from here to get back into shape, if I am back to being in pain.


Thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated.

On 13th March, I was doing perfectly fine. However, that day after I took a shower I was hit with sudden diziness. I didn't think much about it and sat down to eat my food after shower but the diziness started getting worse and I went to clinic. They checked my blood pressure and it was high and so was my heart rate. The Dr told me not to think much about it and it might have to do something with my ear. However, I was not content with his answer so i went to a hospital, there my bp was checked again as well as my heart rate, which was now slightly higher than at the clinic. The hospital then took me into emergency, they gave me some kind of an injection for my diziness, they did my ecg and blood test which all came out normal. The dr at the ER then told me to go to a neurologist if my diziness persists. The next day I went to another clinic where my blood pressure and heart rate was still elevated. The Dr at this clinic told me that it could be due to a possible infection in the ear and the diziness would go away soon. However, the same day i went to a neurologist and he did some physical tests on me, all of which I passed. Then he told me that he doesn't see a neurological problem and i should visit an ENT specialist. Then I went to an ENT specialist the same day, he checked my ears and found no problems, I then did a hearing test which was normal as well. Moreover, the diziness wasn't going away so I then went to multiple cardiologists and had my ecg done again which this time showed ""incomplete right bundle block"". I then had echocardiogram which came out normal and a holter device placed which also came out normal. All the cardiologists told me that my heart was doing fine and just gave me 2 tablets for my elevated blood pressure. I then went for an MRI as asked by another neurologist, the results from the MRI were all normal as well and my neurologist told me that there was nothing to worry. I then went on to see another ENT specialist, who said that I dont have any problems in my ears or whatsover. Lastly, I also have had visited two eye specialists and both of them say that there is nothing wrong with my eyes. 

However, despite all this, my health still isn't getting better. I feel fine certain times of the day and then all of a sudden I feel extremely tired and a need to sleep. This diziness that i have does not involve spinning or anything but it is more like confusion. I dont really know how to explain. Could you please help with whatever this could be.

(a lot of arthititic issues etc...). I chose to stop going to doctors years ago due to an overwhelming anxiety and fear stemming from munchausen by proxy by my grandmother who kept me in doctors and hospitals until I was about 8 or 9, having all kinds of crazy tests run. 

So, recently I broke my foot, took my fiance 9days to get me to the er and when they put the splint on I took it off because it weighed me down so much when I laid down I couldn't get up without more immense back pain, and my back locking up, then I already dealt with. 11 days later and I'm going to the er tonight when he gets home and tbh I'm terrified they'll force me to have surgery. I'm from Alabama and I know in reality as long as you're sane they can't but I'm starting to question that as well, thinking my boyfriend is going to sign something to have me committed. Either way the only option I'm seeing is a shorter cast and rest which is hard because while he works I'm pretty much alone and have nobody here to help with anything.  
Do I have to worry about being forced into surgery of any kind?  Because my back locks up and I already have trouble getting out of bed and moving in the morning, what am I going to do if they have to put another splint on or worse rebreak it right there, which I'm also horrified of. Even making this post I've about scared myslef out of going.
It was my medial malleolus that got broken then another tiny bone sliver was sticking out just above it and that one's really hurting my tibia. I feel so stupid and like a child. 
I start to shake, get nauseous, throw up, cry have flashbacks and physically and mentally cannot handle being touched by staff. All the while my amazing fiance is there the wholw time showing suppert, promising hes not going to force me into anything but that I need to get it checked out. 
I don't know what to do and I don't believe I'll need surgery but I don't know. I do know I can't deal with anything heavy on my legs that'll weigh me down and I'm really afraid of a medical setting to the point I've treated many many other of my health issues at home.

So my roommates and I had a group of people over on Saturday April 15th. About 3 days later (Tuesday April 18th), 2 of the people reached out to tell us that they were diagnosed with staph infections. One of my roommates definitely had skin to skin contact with one of the infected people.  I’ve been absolutely stressed out thinking that we could be infected. I can’t really find any similar situations but I did see that staph could cause toxic shock syndrome, which my roommate barely survived once already. (The same one that had skin to skin contact with an infected friend). None of us have had any suspicious symptoms as of today, but I also saw that it could take a while for symptoms to appear. 

I am 24 years old, male, 6ft, 250 lbs, non smoker, decent health. 
My roommates are around the same age, 2 being male, 1 being female. 

My questions:  

• What do I do now? Should I just keep an eye out for infections and go to the doctor if/when they appear? Will it be too late in the sense that once the infection appears, there becomes a probability of sepsis?  

• What is the timeframe that I should be worried? For example, if I don’t see anything suspicious within 2 weeks, am I pretty much in the clear? Or will I have to be concerned for months?   

• How scared should I be of staph in general? It seems very serious but I know the internet can be evil like that sometimes.   

•What are the chances that staph could turn in to sepsis/toxic shock? Is it a rare occurrence or almost guaranteed if staph goes unnoticed?   

• Should I be extra worried about deep cleaning/sanitizing my entire house?   

• Can it be passed on to pets, specifically cats and dogs?

Two years ago I slipped in someones driveway. Landed on my hip. I messed up my hip/back for a few days but because I had mainly worked from home I never noticed anything but occasional pain after sitting for too long.

After about 30 minutes the pain in my hip and down the back of my leg is nearly unbearable. My back will also lock up leaving me unable to move. Ibuprofen/Tylenol does nothing. Like there is just zero effect.

Made an appointment with my doctor. He said all he can do is prescribe me pain pills and suggest I lose weight. Same thing he said when I originally brought up the fall.

652,AskDocs,"Hi guys, I (19M) had a laparoscopy for my inflamed, unruptured appendix on March 16, about 5 weeks ago to the day. Recovered super quick as young people usually do, was walking tons and resting tons - no straining or physical activity as prescribed. I'd say I noticed a bump on the lowest and largest incision ([https://imgur.com/a/USqtwW1](https://imgur.com/a/USqtwW1) slightly nsfw 3 incisions) around when the pain stopped completely, maybe a week and a half after that? I scheduled an appointment with my surgeon who has amazing credentials that weekend. She inspected it physically and she essentially said it was nothing to worry about and that the process for inflammation to subside in that area takes longer contingent on the size of the wound/area/etc. It's flat, can only be slightly felt when pushed, can't be pushed in, basically the opposite of what you'd consider a hernia in diagnostic terms but I still have to ask about it because it makes me nervous and I wouldn't want to be wasting time scheduling another surgery if I needed it, since I hate being bedridden and sick. It's been about 2 weeks since then, she told me to ice it and whatnot and it hasn't really subsided or gotten any smaller. The reason I felt compelled to make this thread is because I couldn't find any similar experiences online, and searching ""hard bump below my incision"" leads to a billion websites telling you that you have an incisional hernia and to go to the ER. My question is, what do you guys think and can someone educate me on the process of healing or what's happening there? I'm supposedly cleared to start physical activity slowly now, but there would be no point in doing what I like if my progress would be halted by another surgery.

Following an EEG and a head MRI back in March 2023 mum had recieved a letter from neurology saying all test came back fine.

After requesting the full report this was stated in the HEAD MRI report.
Does this state that she has an old small TIA ? If so how long does a TIA show on a brain scan? And why are doctors not concerned?

664,AskDocs,"**Info:**

Sex, age, ethnicity: F, 23, caucasian

Height: 167 cm

Weight: 70kg

Current condition and treatments: GAD in remission, treatment (5 mg Lexapro) was interrupted one week ago per my psychiatrist's suggestion + subclinical levels of hormones that suggest I am at risk of hypothyroidism 

Smoking/Drinking/Drugs: Less than once a week/Once a week/Never

&amp;#x200B;

Main concern that sent me to cardiologist: random pain in the chest and back area, random numbness in left arm, feeling that my heart skipped a bit (it would go like tum tum tum PAUSE tum-tum tum tum tum, sorry for this wonderful academic description, am not great with medical terms) that coincided with me starting weightlifting and pole dancing classes + extra stress related to college assignments 

&amp;#x200B;

Diagnosis: Here is where things get tricky and I do not understand how serious this is. I did and eco scan and an ekg, which I uploaded here: [https://imgur.com/a/H75RmXl](https://imgur.com/a/H75RmXl)  

My doctor said that my heart function is normal, but my mitral valve and my  tricupsid valve are mildly prolaptic and that I have mild mitral insufficiency and moderate tricupsid insufficiency with PAP &lt; 27 mg (I have no idea what this means, just typing out what she wrote on my report). 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me to get an 72h EKG holter and prescribed me 1,25 mg of  Bisoprolol, CoQ10, Rosuvastatin 10mg and Indapamide 1.5 mg. She told me to take the last one only if I have BP, as during the appointment I had 130/99 (although I was both anxious and angry, having waited more than 2 hours with people skipping the line).

&amp;#x200B;

Questions&amp;concerns:

I am not sure if I should start my Bisoprolol treatment since I have not checked my thyroid function since September '22, and I've seen that it is not recommended for people with thyroid issues. My cardiologist said she will give me some blood test the next time I come to her appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

I also do not understand why my valves are prolaptic. Is it genetic or is this attributed to certain lifestyles (sedentary, irregular sleep schedule). But most importantly, are they curable through this treatment? Or does it mean that eventually I will have to get heart surgery? Are they even treatable?

Hi everyone! I know this might be confusing so please just listen. This is not a troll post, I’m as confused as some of you may be. This is her information; (she has given me verbal consent as she doesn’t use Reddit)

So, we’ve been together for around 2 months. This morning, her little sister got on her laptop and messaged me through IG on my girlfriends account. She was explaining to me how she’s actually 16, yet she was telling the truth on living alone, having kids, this and that. She explained that she and her parents never told my girlfriend as it would “warp her entire mindset.”

I called my girlfriend who is at work just now and explained all of this. She is just confused as me, and is going to the doctors tomorrow to get it checked out, and is asking to see her birth certificate. It makes no sense as her drivers license has her birthday that says she’s 20, and she also opened up a bank account in her name with a credit card. None of this adds up, and I’m overthinking where I believe this is a ploy to break me and her apart. Is it truly possible, or is it even a real medical condition where you can think you’re an older age, but you’re actually younger? 

I’ve been asking myself, why did her parents tell the doctor to not tell her? if this is true, how did she graduate? Cause she told me she’s taken all 4 years of high school, and her daughter is turning 4. 

Unrelated; however a while back her parents did also tell me she has chordoma (super rare brain cancer) but they asked the doctors to not tell her, so she’s not getting treatment.

 Hi, so today i wore a wool coat and I noticed i had those little dots on both of my forearms. If i press on them they disappear.
And me being the hypochondriac I am, I began searching for other things on my skin and I found what I think are two blood blisters on my finger and one close to the vein where I get blood drawn ( I did not get blood drawn). Is this dangerous, what does this mean? I had blood blisters before and they resolved in a couple of days by themselves.

682,AskDocs,"25f, 1,60 m and 48 kg, non-smoker and no  current medical issues. A month ago, after doing a session of intense physical exercise, I exited the building and everything started to move around me, especially when I turned my head. I thought it was just due to the fact that I exercised a little too hard and had not eaten enough prior to it. At 5 a.m. the following morning, I woke up vomiting, with the whole room spinning even when I stood still. I went to the hospital and I did a CT investigation, blood tests, an X-ray for my spinal column, an ecography for both my heart and my abdomen, and nothing came out wrong. I was diagnosed with Perypheral Vertigo Syndrome and given Betaserc (Betahistine) to take two times a day along with antiemetics.


A week after, a time during which I could only stay in bed and not move too much, I went to the ENT doctor and she did a few tests, after which she concluded that I do not have BPPV. She did a maneuver on me and although she said nothing changed, I could already feel a bit better (placebo?). She sent me to the neurologist and to have done cranial and cervical MRI tests. The neurologist could not find anything wrong either, and he even said that the MRI would show nothing, and that my diagnosis is BPPV. And, surprise, nothing significant was found on the MRI investigations, only Chronic rhinitis.


However, the vertigo is still quite persistent although it has reduced significantly. I still feel dizzy and get that slight spinning motion when I move my head, and along with that, I get migraines. It still interferes a lot with my day to day life and it stops me from doing a lot of things, including sports. I have now an extreme apprehension towards doing any wrong moves in case it will get worse or back to that horrible initial state. I asked the ENT doctor to do a maneuver on me again but she insists it will not help. Has anyone gone through something similar? Everyone appears to be a bit clueless to the cause of my vertigo, and I don’t know what to do to make it better. I do some easy exercises at home for it but they don’t seem to help a lot.

About a month ago I had my first experience with what I believe is vasovagal syncope. Since then it has happened several times, and I am starting to have crippling anxiety about leaving my house. A little background is I suffer from chronic constipation due to a redundant colon I started taking Linzess 290mcg back in January. I also take lisinopril 10mg for idiopathic hypertension. The Linzess is helpful so I often have loose stools so l'm not straining but a lot of times these episodes happen while I am in the bathroom. I try to stay hydrated and drink water, and usually have at least one Gatorade throughout the day. I believe they are vasovagal episodes because my first feeling is indigestion/nausea then I feel extremely flush and break out into a profuse sweat. Then I often have tunnel vision and my ears start ringing. I have never completely lost consciousness, though I have had to lay down on the floor to prevent myself from what I fear is passing out. I'm concerned that this could be a side effect from taking the lisinopril and also having loose bowel movements due to the Linzess. I have an appointment next week with my primary care provider but I've already had two vasovagal episodes within the last week and I'm starting to really worry.

697,AskDocs,"I \[F 17, 171cm and 60kgs\] has been having a bunch of neurological symptoms for the past 9 months. 

I dont drink or smoke, don't have other issues that im aware of. 

It all started with thigh and thumb twitches. It quickly spread to my whole body. After about a two to three months i felt some sharp pain in one side of my face (right cheek). It happened along with light twitches that i could see but not feel. I consulted a physician and he told me not to worry as long as no muscle atrophy/weakness is present.   

I got really worried as it literally happened everyday all the time, i also read about tongue twitches (being ""never benign"") and started getting them so i visited a neurologist. That was about 6 months ago. He did a clinical test (strength, sensory and reflexes) and told me its just my anxiety thats causing the twitching. I insisted on getting a brain MRI and it came back normal. He ordered a blood work and i dont have any electrolyte imbalances.

He gave me some iron and B12 supplements. I think its worthy to mention that before all of this happened i used to have severe vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency but by the time my symptoms started i didnt have it anymore as i was taking pills for it.     

A few months later, i developed new symptoms. Shooting pains started happening more often (in my face again and arms mostly), i started getting crawling sensations on my skin, tingling and pins and needles (these happen less often) and the twitching never stopped. I visited another neurologist to get a second opinion about a month ago. He ordered another brain MRI to make sure, it came back normal. Did the clinical examination and told me that ""so far i dont have anything serious going on"". He said that he thinks that fibromyalgia is causing my pain but ""it doesnt cause twitching"". He gave me 75mg pregabalin pills and asked me to revisit him after a month of taking it.   

I finished taking the pills but during that month my pains increased for some reason. I get them everyday now. Its a type of sharp deep pain that almost feels like its in the bones and lasts for seconds. I've also developed new symptoms: burning sensations, numbness (lasted for about 4 days in both my thighs), prickling sensations, joint pain (i also sometimes feel like theres some ice in my joints???) and many electric shock sensations in my fingers and toes. The twitching still occurs everyday as well.    

I'm kinda worried it might be something serious (like MS or neuropathy), is it possible to get neuropathy in my age? and does this sound like a fibromyalgia case (im not convinced it is since pain wasnt the initial symptom and i dont experience the other symptoms of fibro).    

What should i do next? I will revisit the neurologist but my parents think im insane at this point so i need some advice. Is it worthy to get a spine MRI??

Sudden weakness started 2 years ago, accompanied with severe stomach pain.

Also lost 20kg in 6 month. I eat more than I used to so its not diet related.

Multiple stomach Ultrasounds came back normal.

Six months after initial weakness my shoulders started to hurt after lifting weights.

It felt like wire being stretched through my arms initially but no pain until day  after lifting.

SHARP shoulder pain on all sides acompanied by hypotrophy of side and posterior deltoid.  My shoulders only look normal from front.  Cant even wash my back. Every time I bathe it hurts like hell.

Mri, EMG and Ultrasound came back normal.  

NSAID helped very slightly while I used it in cream form. 

Soon after that my wrists started to hurt. I cant type for  more than 5 min without discomfort.

10+ min and it hurts progressively. Took 4 month break from computer and it didnt help. Tried all kinds of stretching and strenthening with no help.

Few months later I skipped stair and felt (and heard) loud pop. Since then I have pain in medial and lateral side of knee.

Initially felt no pain just pop. Untill my knee buckled, 30-45 minutes after injury, and I couldnt straighten it with quad activation. 

Still to this day my knee fels off and going downstairs is nightmare. Sometime i hear pop when going down and after pop my knee feels even more off and inflames quickly.  Cant leave house more than 2 times per week for that reason

Did 2 MRIs fo that knee and they are normal beside inflammation found near anterior lateral meniscus. Still it didnt show tear.

Other than these Issues I have many other but I ve got no one to talk to about them.

 Went to multiple doctors: Orthopedic, Physiatrist, Neurologits, Urologist. Went to PT as well, It  was to put it mildy useless.  To this day im undiagnosed despite having healthcare and paying a lot of money I dont have. Rheumatologist wont see me because my CRP is negative.

Did few PRPs for knees and they helped with inflamation but its still nowhere near how it should be.

PRPs for shoulders didnt do much or anthing?

I have no medication prescribed for pain. I Only suplement with Collagen and Glucosamine sulphate. Without them i could barely walk even in my house.

I dont smoke nor drink.

 Its all mentally exhausting. Im to some degree disabled for 2 years and I dont know what to do anymore. 

 I have tried to make this post as short as possible but I just have too much going on so sorry about longevity.

I would also highly appriciate if someone could explain what this could be..

Mine looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/0S8XadN)

My(37m) thumb has been bugging me for about a year after working with my FiL with a cement project. I had gloves on but a whole ripped open. This is the only definitive event I recall before this started happening

These little blister-like bumps show up in clusters. It stay isolate near the top fingerprint side of my thumb. It doesn't go anywhere else. It's sensitive to hot water and usually flare up if I do dishes or take a shower.

I have popped them before and the liquid comes out much like a blister and I assume it's the same substance. Then it gets sore like a popped blister and then the skin dies and hardens and the blisters will come back a few days later under the hardened skin and I havento wrap my thumb in cortisone or petroleum jelly for a day or so to soften it up.

What the he'll is this? An urgent care doctor saw it and said it looks like herpes but didn't say much else since I was in for a different thing at the time.

It's not excruciating...just annoying more than anything.

702,AskDocs,"I’ve been having chest pain in left pec region and sternum since early Feb. I had been working out in the gym almost everyday; workouts included bench pressing. The feeling is a dull/pressure like sensation that comes and goes along with quick stabbing pain that comes and goes. I’ve also had burning sensation in both pecs that sometimes occur. Everyone once in a while I get slight pressure/discomfort between right chest pec region and by armpit 

I’ve been to the ER 4 times; EKG test every single time and Chest X-Rays - All normal. Went to Cardiologist multiple times and had Echo test which came back normal.

Chest CT Angiogram, everything came back normal and unremarkable except small partial blood found in lower lobe of right lung. Primary care Doctor started me on Blood Thinners; it’s been a month now. Primary care doctor had me do Ultrasounds for both legs as well, both came back normal. 
Hematologist said I don’t have blood clotting disorder and the blood clot was unprovoked. 

It’s been 2 months and I still have dull pressure/burning sensation in both pecs and occasional dull pressure in Chest Wall/Sternum area. Cardiologist and Primary Care Doctor diagnosed me with Costochondritis. I asked Cardiologist for Chest or Cardiac MRI but they refused because all my readings were normal with the exception of the blood clot; Also said there was no reasoning for MRI. Cardiologist said all tests are normal and there is nothing life-threatening. I was thinking about getting an MRI on my own and paying out of pocket. 

Should I get a Chest or Cardiac MRI since I already had multiple EKG’s, X-Ray’s, Echo Test, and CT Angiogram? I’m just really trying to get to the bottom of what’s going on and I want to make sure we really haven’t overlooked cardiovascular issue!!!!!! 

Neurologist also did Brain/NeckMRI - Normal Results. 
Seen two Rheumatologist - everything came back normal except ANA being positive. I do have an overactive immune system from having Alopecia as a child and teenager. 

Now I’m waiting to see if Abdomen CT Scan will be approved by insurance (hematologist is appealing it now) and Lumbar Spine MRI will be approved by insurance accompany (Neurologist is appealing it now.)

Additional Symptoms
Now I have new symptoms that include Burning Legs, Burning Lower Back Pain, Lower body (Leg Weakness), Lightheadedness/Non-Spinning Dizziness that comes and goes, and shortness of breath that comes and goes. 

Current Symptoms
*Lightheadedness/Dizziness  
*Chest Pain
*Shortness of Breath
*Foggy Head
*Unsteadiness
*Fatigue
*Difficulty Concentrating
*Feeling Jittery/Shakey/Trembling 
*Numbness/Tingling
*Depersonalization 
*Lower Back Pain
*Burning Legs 
*Anxiety/Depression


Current Diagnosis:
Small Partial Thrombus (Primary Care Doctor)
Costochondritis - (Primary Care Doctor &amp; Cardiologist) 
Fibromyalgia &amp; Anxiety (Neurologist)
Anxiety - (Therapist)

I feel like I’m in limbo and just want to feel normal again. Hopefully it’s nothing life threatening and something that can be resolved in due time. 32 Male, 230lbs, multiple blood pressure and oxygen readings have been normal.

Hello everyone, I’ve been losing weight for the last 7 months, and I am 91lbs down from my highest weight. My weight loss appears proportional throughout my body except for my upper arms. I’ve had extremely large, hanging upper arms since I was 16. I was at a healthy bmi at that point, and I remember they ballooned seemingly overnight. Since then, they have always been disproportionate to the rest of my body. I thought losing weight would help slim them down. While they’re slightly less voluminous, they’re still massive. I’ve been doing some research on it, and lipedema has popped up in the results. The symptoms seem to fit, except it’s only my upper arms that has been effected.

707,AskDocs,"19M. Last night I was laying in bed with my head propped up, scrolling through social media. I was dumb enough to be chewing on a piece of plastic, it's a small piece, about .5inch in length and width, and when I saw something funny I laughed causing the piece to be sucked back into my throat.

My first instinct for some reason was to swallow it instead of coughing it up...I attempted to swallow it and it awkwardly went down...I think? 

Then came the typical panic and Google search which causes you to freak out a bit. My throat felt funky like it didn't go down but eventually I calmed down and was able to sleep, hoping it would be fine in the morning.

I woke up this morning and my throat still has that feeling, and I'm concerned I may have aspirated it since I was inhaling when it happened.

I haven't really had any coughing but eating food does feel a bit weird. I'm assuming it maybe scratched my throat and that is causing the feeling, and it will eventually go away and I'll pass the piece of plastic in my stool.

I mainly just want to know how I can confirm if it's anything to be concerned about, since the internet is always vague in explanations. Can testing lung capacity by holding my breath help? I very much appreciate any responses!

34F, 5’7”, 160lb, non-smoker, on 120mg Propranolol for high blood pressure, and anxiety.  
Major pelvic surgery in 2023, recovered fully. 

I started running at the beginning of the pandemic. My small local gym had closed for good, and this alternative gave my life so much enrichment and joy despite all that was going on in the world! As stated above, I am nearly a year out from major surgery, which was a rollercoaster of a recovery, but I am now feeling 100% back to normal. I had been planning on racing in an event this summer, so I had been amping up my training plan for that. Generally, I had no issues with running aside from some temporary plantar fasciitis (remedied with insoles for high arches), an ankle roll (remedied with rest and stretching), and occasionally sore legs that would be OK the next day. I would run roughly 30-35 mpw throughout the year. 

Over the winter, I began my training for a half-marathon in May. At the end of January, I had to stop on a 9-mile run because of pain behind my right knee, that radiated to the left side of my kneecap. This “pain” started when I noticed it hurt to pull my winter boot off on that leg, but didn’t give me issues until this point. I hobbled home and took a few weeks off rehabbing the area but the pain persisted. 

I booked a consult with an orthopedic doctor the following week, where I was assessed. They poked around where I felt pain, and, while I never really had issues with my IT band, they hyper-focused on a slightly tender spot in that region, saying that this is all probably due to some irritation in that area. The doctor then suggested a cortisone shot in that spot to reduce inflammation and get me back to training. After a little more assessment where I asked if this would help the other pain on the OTHER side of my knee, he said that the IT band is probably the culprit. Believing him, (and slightly desperate) I agreed to the cortisone shot. He said this should fix my problem, didn’t give me any guidance on follow-up care, did the injection in the office (ow), and once it was done, he had me get up and see how it felt. Due to the topical anesthetic, my knee felt painless, and I felt a glimmer of hope as he sent me on my way, saying to stretch the IT band area like it was my job, and if there was no improvement, to call and I could get scheduled for an MRI.

Oh, how naive I was. I got home and laid down for a nap, noticing a little pain, but ignoring it. When I woke up an hour later, I was in tears and agony with how much pain my knee was suddenly in. It was so stiff I could barely stand, and I tearfully hobbled around for the next two days. The pain has settled on a baseline ache, and it is impossible to run even 20 feet before I have to stop due to the pain. The pain behind my knee and to the left of my knee cap persisted.

So, I feel it out. Maybe I need to give it more time? I just need to be patient. I reach out to an old co-worker who is a physical therapist and he graciously offered some IT-Band rehab exercises that I do for a few weeks with no relief. At this point, I am crying nearly every day, wanting nothing more than to be able to get active again. I transfer my event registration to my spouse who will run it in my stead. 

Three weeks later, I call to report zero improvements to my knee. They schedule an MRI, the MRI is done, I get a report in my MyChart that is all doctor-speak alluding to a baker’s cyst, some swelling, but overall, no torn meniscus/ligaments/growths/etc. I go to the same doctor’s office to review the MRI. When I tell him about the pain persisting, he looks dumbfounded and says something about some people don’t react the normal way to cortisone injections, and I must be one of them. We reach no conclusion, other than to not run all summer, and check in again in 2 months. 

At this point, I am feeling so defeated, unable to do one of my favorite things, angry at myself for agreeing to the injection, and my knee is starting to visually look like the tissue where the injection was done is degenerating into a deep divot. It is still tender to the touch.

After all of that disappointment, I advocate for myself and get signed up for physical therapy to sort out the other side pain. The PT immediately is able to deduce a pes anserine bursae, and that my right leg is weaker than my left. FINALLY, something solid to go off of! She gives me exercises to work on and that brings me to the present. I go in for another check with her in two weeks. 

So, where I’m at with this is: WHAT THE F!@#?? Did I totally mess up my IT band by doing the cortisone shot? How long should I expect this pain to continue? Is the cortisone even still in my body at this point? Or will it take 6-12 months to go away? 

Any advice is appreciated, good or bad.

Please help, I’m spiralling.

Before I begin this - just want to make super clear I have chronic health anxiety so would appreciate kind words of advice/reassurance 🩷 

My wisdom tooth is coming through, I can see at the back I have gum covering some of it, so it’s still erupting through. It seems to be coming through fine and last time I got an x-ray, I was told I shouldn’t have any issues with them growing through. 

I do however believe I have pericoronitis - it occasionally hurts to eat on that one side but only if the food hits the gum or if I bite down really hard. I have NO other symptoms like swollen cheeks, finding it hard to swallow, sleep etc! 

I have a tiny white dot on my cheek but this came through this morning and I did bite down on it yesterday so feel this isn’t anything of concern.

I’ve been doing salt water rinses for the last day, putting numbing gel on it, eating on the other side and taking ibuprofen. 

I haven’t been to the dentist in ages and if I can help if I don’t want to (please don’t give me any hate for this :() 

I was just wondering if it’ll clear up in a few days or if I need antibiotics and if so can I get a Dr to prescribe this?

I keep thinking I have cancer or I’m going to die.

I've been taking Setraline for over a decade and my body is extremely sensitive to lowered dosages. I'm down to 50mg a day and my pharmacy only supplies 50mg pills that can be snapped in half. Going to 25mg for just one day a week has messed with my anxiety pretty badly already.

My doctor is probably not going to supply me with the liquid Setraline, so I'm considering getting some fine scales and measuring out precise doses. E.g. 22.5 or 90% of my current dose.

Does this sound possible on paper? Or will crushing the pills make it not possible to take them properly?

I began drinking heavily every day during the pandemic. If you consider 1oz of liquor one drink, then I have 3oz per drink at about 3 drinks per day. Did this and sometimes more on weekends for 2 years. I don't consider myself someone who is heavily dependent, I am fine with quitting, have done it before, and my body does not experience shakes, sweats, or anything of the sort. 

Since the heavy drinking began, I have noticed some degradation in both my memory and overall brain function. I have essentially been living tired, dehydrated, and with brain fog every day for the last two years. I am experiencing normal withdrawal such as fatigue and issues sleeping which is making the brain fog a lot worse. I'm okay with that as I know it will improve. 

What I am really looking for is how can I help support brain function so that I can get out from under this brain fog long-term and hopefully improve my memory? I have begun exercising, focusing on nutrition, sleep, and hydration. I am wondering if incorporating something specific can help, such as fish oil supplements? Maybe up my intake of certain foods?

A month ago I went to get a routine check up. My (fasted blood) showed 21 AST / 20 ALT. So all was normal. Now, the other day I started feeling a very bad stomach pain, and at seconds I couldn’t breath. I tried walking it off but I had to stop it was so painful. Then I threw up just vile, and felt better. I went to urgent care and they took X-rays of my heart and said everything was normal. They didn’t do ultrasounds because it was after hours and the technician was gone for the day. They took blood tests. The alarming part is that now my tests read 405 AST / 180 ALT. They told me to reach out to my doctor ASAP.

DIAGNOSES: GERD, IBS-C, SIBO

 recently got diagnosed with post infections IBS. It is type-C(meaning constipation). These GI started around late August 2020 when I got a very severe respiratory infection with symptoms identical to covid-19 but the swab tests were negative.  I got SIBO in 2021 from overusage of laxatives(bisacodyl/Dulcolax) but that was successfully treated with antibiotics(Cipro). But the IBS returned. I have found that using laxatives for more than a few days causes stomach inflammation which can take up to a week to subside. 

The doctor told me that there really is no cure for this but it can improve with time. So I need to know: What are the causes of post-infectious IBS? Is it the result of neurological damage to the intestinal tract? Can nerve damage also cause visceral hypersensitivity?  HOW can nerve damage be detected? If this is caused by dysbiosis, I wonder how effect a Fecal Microbial Transplant would be.",t2_5nc0f7v0,0,Post infectious IBS(type-C),[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12t0emw,True,Tavarshio,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12t0emw/post_infectious_ibstypec/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12t0emw/post_infectious_ibstypec/,476106,1682000810,0,,False,1682000828,1682000829,2023-04-20 14:26:50,,,

First noticeable synonyms started:Jan this year 

My nerves have been firing off since January (muscle spasms, constant eye twitching, tingles, numb spots, and the worse- sharp nerve pain all over) but I have no signs of nerve damage (have done a EMG and MRI of brain and cervical spine). 
Can someone give me some insight on what could be causing this? 
Little back story, I first noticed what I now know to believe was nerve pain in my toe back in November right before I had my baby. 
Forgot about it and it came back 7 weeks PP. (had an emergency C section so was basically taking it easy up until 6 weeks)

I’ve also done tons of bloodwork and everything is pretty normal as far as that goes to. The only thing is in jan my theoid was a little off and I retested a month later and it was normal. I was also slightly anemic but again once I retested that was also normal. 

My neurologist said after I got my skin biopsy back (he was maybe thinking I had small fiber but it came back negative to my astonishment) that some normal healthy people can have their nerves fire off for no reason.

It starts around the lower back/right side of the buttocks and goes through the back of the leg down to my foot.

There's no pain, just this annoying spasming/twitching. It goes on constantly. I can't really point out when it started, but it's been the same since, it's not progressing or anything.

It's mostly noticed when I'm still (laying down or sitting), but it doesn't really interfere with my day to day activities.

From my layman search I would guess that it has something to do with sciatica/piriformis/pudendal nerve, but I'm not sure.

750,AskDocs,"36M. Statin daily 

I was introduced to Mounjaro back in August of last year for weight loss. I know it’s not approved yet for weight loss but back in August, online doctors were prescribing it with RX coupons. It works, I lost 30 pounds. Typical side effects but a few side effects I did not expect. 

A few weeks into treatment, I noticed my legs aching a bit. The feeling like I had walked a theme park all day but I didn’t. I checked side effects for Mounjaro and this is nowhere to be found. Posting about it and everyone said it’s electrolytes, which made sense to me. I stopped the drug for a month to see if it went away and it did. Starting it back up, and it returned. But… I upped by water, potassium, magnesium, and sodium, but didn’t go away. Also, I had blood labs done twice and both came back great. No issues. 

Add onto this, I have had balance issues. It’s like I’m falling back or forward sensation. I’ve noticed this also when I’m standing while having sex as well. It was bad enough that I fell once but didn’t think much of it at the time because I tripped over an object. I’ve noticed that recently I get a bit light headed when lifting weights too. So, blood pressure issues? 

A couple things I’m nervous about. Peter Attia [GLP and Lean Mass](https://peterattiamd.com/the-downside-of-glp-1-receptor-agonists/) has recently pointed out that DEXA scans reveal to him that these medications cause too much muscle loss. I’m also wondering if I lost too much weight, although I have lost this much before and never had these issues. 

Thoughts?  I am stopping the medication because of this but also wanted to post my experience to help others make an informed decision.

39F, diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis eight years ago. Active disorder (in and out of flares) last three years. Hydrochlorquine and methotrexate no help. Currently on leflunomide, Celebrex and sulfazine but need to move to biological. Leflunomide did help for past nine months. Next specialist appointment not until Sept 5. 

I am in the middle of a flare. My hands are trembling, they ache and are stiff, my wrists and elbows hurt. I’m extremely fatigued. I have basically eight good hours a day (My work hours 8-4pm). The commute is short, but it is exhausting getting ready, going into work, all the preparations to get to work with my home life and packing my laptop everyday. Brain fog is hitting (I regularly, 3 times a week, have had to leave iou‘s at stores I frequent because I can’t find my wallet or bank card).

I’m stiff, sore, achy and tired. I can see my disease is progressing. I have a lack of attention and brain fog is hitting quite badly. 

My family doctor did a one month accommodation to work from home. My work refused. I’m therefore asking my doctor to put me back on leave for a month, for my system to calm down. 

My work has said for my documents to “indicate the restrictions and limitations that are preventing you from attending with physically but where you are able to continue to work from home”.  I see they are trying to catch me with the Vs. type of statement. Any suggestions on how to possibly word this, if I decide to pursue the work from home accommodation and not go off work?

So I (18M) went on holiday with a friend last week, we were there 4 days. Being on holiday we partook in drinking alchol, quite a lot of it. In the 4 days I was there I drank a lot. 3 of the 4 days with one break day inbetween. I've returned home and I just have not been feeling right ever since. I've been having headaches, shortness of breath and relatively fast heart rate at points along with what I can only describe as brain fog and tingling in my fingers as well. I've been back 3 days.

Now its 100% my fault, I drank way too much and should've been so much more responsible and suffering the consequences of my actions is deserved but these are symptoms i've never experienced after drinking. I am wondering can extended periods of excessive drinking (4 days in this case) cause these symptoms and is it just my body trying to readjust and heal itself? I have no plans to drink alcohol for a long time after this holiday. I'm also not over-weight and have no prior medical problems that I know of.

I’m not sure if it’s a spider bite, some kind of rash or skin condition. But after looking online I’m worried it could be an infection, or something worse.

790,AskDocs,"Two days ago I didn't see a hole in the sidewalk and stretched my ankle. It hurt for the moment, then not anymore. I could walk without a problem 20m to the next chair. The foot wasn't swollen and I pressed every spot on the foot without anything hurting so I assumed everything was OK. 500 m later it started hurting slightly. Called a taxi and went to the next doctor. X-ray was fine. During the waiting time the hurting got a little worse and I could find the hurting spot with my finger. Doctor said it's the ligament is stretched and I should cool, bandage and rest for 1 to 3 weeks.

Since then, I have to no pain, still no swelling and can't find the hurting spot anymore. I assume, I was lucky and only stretched it a little (?). It only hurts when I step on uneven ground. Crossing the street to the restaurant today was no problem while holding the ankle stiff.

Information on the internet is very vague and says to ask the doctor. Problem is, I'm in a foreign country right now, so talking to the doctor was really hard.

I bandaged my foot with compression bandages as shown on WikiHow.

Here are my questions:
1. When can I walk short distances again? 
2. How fast can I start walking longer distances? 1 to 3 weeks is very vague. Does it need to be ""no pain"" or is ""almost no pain"" already ok?

791,AskDocs,"Hey docs 

I'm male, 26 years old, 5 feet 10 at 150 pounds. 

I've never been in such a systemic all-over body pain in my life. 

So this goes back a few days ago. I spent all day Tuesday cleaning the house, bathrooms, toilets etc because I had a house inspection coming up and felt great. 

I woke up Wednesday morning at 7am with a noticeable sore throat, that gave me pain to drink. Non the less I went to work not thinking much of it and by about Wednesday afternoon I had to leave home because I was shivering non stop, muscles felt like a truck hit me, mild fever fever 38.2c and the throat pain become unbearable. 

Today it has become worst again. I haven't eaten anything all day because I feel nausea. But the worst symptom is the throat pain. Even swalloing my saliver feels like a hundred shards of broken glass set on fire. I've been in bed all day shivering, cannot get warm for the life of me. Pain medication gives small to mild relief at best if that. 

Do I need to go to the hospital? I feel like I'm truly on deaths door. 

TLDR: Symptoms - fever 2 days, the worst throat pain imaginable. Muscle aches, shivering cold all day under 2 blankets with heater on high. Feel fatigued to my bones. Can't eat and want to vomit.

792,AskDocs,"24F, 240lb, Caucasian, no regular medications, smoker, prone to skin infections - doctor speculates I may be a staph carrier and have already been prescribed oral antibiotics 3-4 times over the last 12 months. 

Hey all! I noticed this mozzie bite roughly 1 week ago and have noticed myself scratching quite often although I have done my best not to. 

Yesterday I noticed it appeared to be infected and had a little bit of swelling. I cleaned it using an antibacterial soap, popped some betadine and a bandaid on it and went about my day. 

Today when changing the dressing I've not noticed any improvement. The swelling is still present, the redness hasn't subsided and its began producing quite a bit of pus. 

I'm wondering if this warrants a trip to the GP for antibiotics or not.

The reason I'm asking this is because I'm feeling  kind of existentially conflicted so I need to know if it was actually a real possibility that I could have died. That way I'll know how to feel about it and it might stop it from happening again. . 

A couple of weeks ago I took 150x 50mg nortriptyline pills. Changed my mind after about 15 minutes and vomited up as much as I could, then I went to sleep. I woke up about 10 hours later feeling absolutely terrible. I couldn't stand up, or use my hands properly with a massive tremor, and I had a bad cramp in my shoulder. I called the mental health help line because I wasn't sure what I should do,  and they sent an ambulance. Once in the ambulance I lost consciousness. I woke up a few hours later and felt good enough to be discharged. 

Fast forward 24 hours and I took 56x 50mg nortriptyline pills, and went to sleep again. Woke up about 10 hours later again feeling even worse than before. Got an ambulance sent again. This time I faceplanted multiple times on the footpath on the way to the ambulance. In the ambulance I had a seizure and they stuck some kind of tube down my nose. I have very little memory of the next little while, but I seemed to wake up at one point and I was in ICU. I think I was there for around 18 hours, which I was unconscious for a lot of. I spent two further days in hospital after getting out of ICU. 

One of the reasons I'm questioning the seriousness of this, is that in the discharge summary it has some of the tests and measurements they did and they don't sound that bad. Not bad enough to die anyway.

So this happened out of the blue two days ago. I woke up in the morning and I noticed that my penis shaft and the seam on the underside of my penis was a little bit raw. I didn’t think much about it because my wife and I have sex pretty frequently and I kind of assumed it really was just raw. It was uncomfortable to the touch, but it wasn’t burning, stinging or red. That night I took a shower, and when the water hit it, it set it on fire! I took the pictures below directly after the shower.

I put Bactroban on it and yesterday morning it was a little better, but the shower still stung a little bit. This morning, it is still there and noticeable. However, it does not affect me during the day whatsoever.

There is nothing at all on the head. Only the shaft. Of course, I went through all of Google and Reddit trying to figure it out myself. The only thing that is impossible would be an STD.

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

My sons school keeps calling telling me he’s out of control hyper on the bus, playground and lately in class. “Absolutely cannot sit still.” 

I’ve decided to do an at home experiment so to speak, of a diet with no added sugars and no synthetic dyes, as well as limiting screen time but specifically eliminating all instant gratification type screens (YouTube,
Nintendo). Up to this point he typically eats well, more sugar and colorful garbage cereal than I would care to admit. Probably 30 mins of tv before school and 60-90 mins of tv in the evening when he’s home after sports and extra curriculars. Sleeps from 8pm-7am. On the weekends we let him stay up until 9 or 9:30. 

Everything I’m reading says there is clear correlation btw behavior issues/hyperactivity and synthetic dyes, yet I’m curious to know if this is conspiracy theory and generally not accepted as truth by physicians

Hi there, first-time poster here! I am posting this because other forums weren't as helpful as I'd hoped and it isn't a subject you talk about in everyday life. Ever since I started becoming sexually active (18y/o), **I have been having bladder issues which were then combined with very, VERY annoying vaginal pains around my 21st**. I am seeing a gynaecologist tomorrow (for IUD insertion after it has moved twice), but I am afraid they will not have enough time to dive into this problem with me and I was wondering if actual doctors would have a gist of what is happening here and what could've caused it. 

To preface this, some context might be needed. I never have had any bladder nor vaginal issues but this started happening after I started becoming sexually active. Unfortunately, I immediately started birth control (pill) at the same time so that might also be the trigger for these problems. I did have a bladder infection a couple of times so those were treated immediately and they went away. I also haven't had STDs. My bladder just started randomly becoming overactive and I think I've peed my pants more in the past 6 years than I have done when I was little. It's obviously very annoying and uncomfortable. Sometimes I'm able to stop it, other times, I'm not. At first, I thought it was because of a weak pelvic floor, but I think it's actually super strong because of all the tension and training I've done in keeping my pee in. I thought it would get less of a problem once I stopped with the pill (stopped with hormonal bc in December 22, got a copper IUD) and that it was because of the pill that it might've been happening. It did in fact get less of a frequent problem, but it's still happening nevertheless. Just this morning, in fact.

Around the same, I started getting these horrible, burning pains inside my vagina. They randomly show up and I will either have to sit through it + drink it away (doesn't always help) or (recently found this out) sit in a bath in lukewarm water for 30 mins. This started happening around the time I was 20/21-ish and at first, I thought it had to do with sex. However, I now know that it will have random triggers. When it happens, everything I do is almost intolerable because of the consistent, burning sensations. It makes me miserable. It's not actual pains (like shooting, stabbing pains), but it's so painful/annoying and all I want to do at those times is lie down in agony. As mentioned before, it's not an STD (recently tested) or a bladder infection (or it's a really, hard one that's always been there, but not sure about that one there because it doesn't feel like a UTI). I don't have to pee all the time, but when I do, it does burn and hurt (and I involuntarily will have to tense my bladder muscles until I'm sure everything's out). It's also not a fungal infection, because I've been treated for that too and it's still returning nevertheless. The triggers for it that I've identified so far are sex (not always and never during, always a couple of hours afterwards), tampons, alcohol/a hangover but it will also just appear at the most random times with no identifiable trigger whatsoever. At first, I thought that this was also because of BC, but once I stopped, it still kept appearing. 

Um yeah, so lots of things happening here and I'm wondering if anyone could give me a gist of what they think might be causing it... It's kind of interfering with my everyday life and I'm over it. Sorry for the long text, but wanted to be as clear as possible.

I kept presenting back to emergency 4-5 times. I was unable to work and struggled with any PADLs My gyni had pretty much told me I was drug seeking. Keep in mind this was the first time I’d ever had an S8 and to make matters worse I work with the surgeon on a surgical floor.

Once admitted I spoke to a pain specialist. He diagnosed me with nerve damage to the left Ilioinguinal nerve.

I’ve had 2 radio frequency nerve deviations to the nerve near the left surgical site aprox 7cm above in line with the nerve. I also had one on my left lumber at t12-l1 with no improvement I’ve tried a ketamine infusion but reacted badly. I’ve had a lignocaine infusion with slight benefits. Currently in hospital now having one so far nil improvement.

My nerve pain has now become Complex regional pain. I work when I can but generally spend all day not moving so I can do a shift and then come home In 8-9/10 pain where my PRN medication doesn’t help

I’ve been told by my specialist there is nothing else he can do for me in regards to my pain and referred me to another specialist who I have to fly 2hrs to see (I’m in Australia) to have a trial nerve stimulator and if that’s successful I will have one implanted 3-4 months later.

A couple of months ago, I started noticing my left hand was quite shakey, particularly when held out next to my right hand which doesn’t have any kind of tremor.

I’ve also noticed my entire arm feels weak and has lost a significant amount of strength. My grip still seems to be fine.

This is accompanied by some very unusual sensations in my left chest. I’m constantly aware of my heart beat and it often feels like it’s either twitching, fluttering, skipping a beat or suddenly beats multiple times in a row with no gap (not sure if I explained that all too great). 

I had an EKG done in November 22, which came back clear. However, these symptoms started around January 23. 

I also have significant pains/acheyness 
in my left hip and leg. My leg often feels heavy and again, trembles/feels significantly weaker. These symptoms started before my chest/arm symptoms and was accompanied by spotting so currently waiting a gynaecologist appointment.

I thought the leg pains and bleeding were linked but now I’m wondering if the chest/arm pain are linked to the leg/hip pain and bleeding is a separate issue.

Sitting here now, my arm feels like it’s slowly going dead and my heart feels like it’s shaking in my chest, not beating. 

I don’t know if it’s something to do with my muscles, nerves or my heart. Can’t get a doctors appointment for a few months and I’m really concerned what could be causing this. 

Also been experiencing pain/numbness in bottom left of head and fatigue/loss of energy.

813,AskDocs,"\[M21\] For over a year now I've been struggling with a condition where I often feel like I'm losing control of the muscles in my pelvic area. They seem to randomly become tense by themselves and when that happens it feels like if I lose control or relax for even a second I will pee myself. 

I've been to urologists and physios, and they say that everything seems fine with me physically. 

I noticed that these symptoms have a huge psychological aspect to them. They mostly come up when I actively think about them or get worried before situations where it would be very inconvenient to feel like you're about to pee yourself (public transport, on the street, etc).

My question - is it even possible for symptoms like that to be 100% psychological?

1. I can see very faint pulsating just below the center of my ribcage. I am not experiencing any pain. After researching, I think it might be because I am too thin. 
2. I can feel my neck pulsating, it's very annoying but doesn't come to a point where it shows up externally in the neck. (just feeling it). I don't feel pain either. Most observable when I sit down, not distracted. It becomes worse when I touch it too often, have physical contact with a pillow (when I sleep), or when I'm stressed/anxious. 
3. My head is pulsating. (this is the most annoying). It's most observable when I lay down. I feel like my head is shaking because of the beat, I don't feel pain either. This one is the harbinger of stress. No headache, migraine, or something else. Just feeling like my veins or back of the head are pulsating.

817,AskDocs,"I recently when I hospital and had a horrible dismissive nurse who really hurt me.
I had superglue on my eye and had to have irrigation. was introduced to a doctor and a student nurse who had a weird attitude from the start that I could tell annoyed the doctor she was working with. 

She said
'how did you manage that' and scoffed.
1 asked if irrigation was necessary as i had seen online they can sometimes remove the film of glue off the eye after numbing and she spoke down to me saying 'no so because the EYEEEEE is very sensitive we have to irrigate' and then turned away.


Anyways the doctor put numbing drops in my eye and seconds later placed in the Morgan lens and did not instruct me what to do just held my eye open and didn't speak. This hurt and it was not running/wet


After it was in he left and the nurse told me she was now attaching the bag. The pressure was very strong and felt like a garden hose on my eye and pushed my eye back. I asked her concerned and she said YUP. it's free flowing.. and left.

I asked her how long it would be and she said until it's done...????

It got pretty intense and I called her to ask how long left and she said until it's done. I said i cant see the bag is it possible you could ask the doctor to come and see when he can take it out asap. And she said 'Yep so like I just said I'm going to take it out when it's done! 

And then left don't know how much later it was but it completely stopped and it was getting really really uncomfortable, it was basically suction cupped to my eye and hurt.

I nurse call buttoned her and she came, for 10 minutes I heard her outside the room asking the doctor how to take it out.
I was getting really irritated and started panicking and when she came in the room I said please take it out right now it has suction cupped to my eye and I told her I was panicking. She sighed and slowly went to the other side of the room and randomly started reorganising things on the other side of the room. 

I was holding the lens on my eye and was so uncomfortable I panicked and sat up and pulled it out. I was crying and hyperventilating. She gasped and slammed something on the table and said. That's definitely wasn't the best idea. Left the room and I never saw her again

Edit; wanted to add i felt really uncomfortable and dismissed the whole time and this was already a shit and embarrassing situation for me,

The doctor didn’t read my file said AS I WAS LAYING ON THE TABLE “are you sure you want to do this?” I was like huh??? YOUR THE DOCTOR! Anyway he said he didn’t really read my chart and was confused why I was referred by another doctor for a biopsy because I am so young and skinny I thought it wasn’t a risk for cancer! 

Mind you my cousin had lymphoma at 18 years old

Anyway here we are now my lyphnodes got bigger since the last ulta sound so I have a biopsy in 5 days.
Does a neck biopsy hurt??

Here were my measurements from the last ultra sound compared to the previous,

I have no other symptoms I feel on top of the world sometimes my lyphnodes hurt or are sore so I’m hoping thats a good sign??

Please tell me if you have been diagnosed if you think this is unlikely to be cancer or if I should be concern a bit because everyone else posts say theirs have been swollen for 2-3 months.

I’m in my last year of college at university of Hawaii and I’m so scared I don’t know if I should plan my future I wanted to go to flight school to become a pilot  now I’m like what if I have 5 years left? Also my other cousin got leukemia at 17 I’m just like it’s unlikely for there to be 3 cancer cases in one family right ?? 
I also heard it’s more common for boys.
Please give me information for signs it could just me a virus or infection. I don’t have any other symptoms and I’m not sick.

Very little medical history, probably high functioning autism (did not pursue full dx), lost diagnosis of PTSD after domestic violence 11 years ago, living isolated (no close relationships, no family, living in a foreign country). Family history of autism and EDS and cancers of all types.

This is related to me living in a slightly seedy neighborhood that unfortunately has been getting seedier over the past few years. There is some backlash against people who look like me and so now there is a lot of shouting and activity concentrated under my window every night. Nobody can sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time, it has started having an influence on my relationships with other people because I am sulky, have periodic heart palpitations and am becoming very withdrawn. 

I have to stay here for at least a few months. There is no way to sleep during the day, it literally never gets quiet here except for 2-3 hours at night if I am lucky and the street people decide to be quiet.

What I already do: I am drinking less coffee and trying to cut back on the cigarettes because I know they make the palpitations worse. I am using the ""tree shaped"" airplane earplugs (all day all night) but unfortunately the shouting cuts right through them. I take vitamins B-complex, C, I take Mg and Ca and I take N-acetylcysteine. I also take creatine for my lifting which I know has some brain benefits. 

What else can I do? I have trouble focusing and the heart palpitations scare me, I never had them all the time. I am afraid my body is getting exhausted.

826,AskDocs,"Hello,

I (43F), sporty (regular strenght training) 60 kg at 168 cm, recently diagnosed with HPV and have been put on waiting (so that my body will hopefully overcome it) and regular check-ups, taking nightly intravaginally Deflagyn-gel  since 3,5 months as prescribed by my doctor, have had proably a cyst on my ovary that burst or sth else...  I do not have polycistic ovary syndrome, never had any problems with ovulation so far. I had a large fibroid in the past (11 years ago) that got surgically removed but I never felt it and it wasnt causing me any problems. My last ultrasound was on March 1st and everything was normal.  

I normally feel when the egg matures in my ovary and exits the ovary into the falopian tube and when it is gone from the tube - the whole process normally lasts about 24 h for me. I do not feel anything anymore from the point the egg enters my uterus.

Last cycle I knew something was wrong. I felt the egg got ""bigger"" but then there was no bursting, no spotting and I had the feeling it got ""stuck"" at the ""end of the ovary"" - right on the spot before I start feeling the egg usually passing down the tube. I thought this was odd,  told my bf,  and said I hope this will clear up when my period comes. Period came, but it did not clear up the stuck egg. Instead it started bothering me even more - I felt pressure and discomfort particularly at night for days on end. 

Last sunday evening (I was mid of cycle again - time for ovulation) I suddenly felt something burst in that same ovary - just like I do when I ovulate - and  I had a brownish spotting discharge and I was hoping it was that stuck egg, altho it didnt feel unstuck at that point. I woke up on monday mornin morning feeling a lot of pain at the end of my ovary and the beginning of the falopian tube. During the day the pain increased to sharp stabbing pains through out all of my tube that got me really scared! I got my bf to get a preganancy test - in case I had an ectopic pregnancy. The test was negative. Then I thought what if I had appendicits. A few hours later the pain down the tube became more bearable and it was subsiding. I felt like the pressure from the stuck egg at the end of my ovary was gone, but I felt really sore and ""hurt"" there  - also down my entire tube. 

On tuesday I had a business trip - was whole day on my feet. When I came back to the hotel at 11 pm and went to pee, my panties looked normal (no discharge), but when peeing I felt something oozing out of me. I wiped it off with toilet paper and in horror saw that I just ""birthed"" a huge blood cloth!! It was like a clump of blood! 

I did not have any further bleeding. I am back from my business trip today and intend to go to the dr today if possible. 

What could have happened? Could my body somehow failed to mature the egg in the previous cycle, that became a cyst and now in the next cycle the second egg, that matured, pushed the old cyst through the tube with it?? Has anyone ever experinced this?

I asked a friend w PCOS and she said she can defo feel when her cysts are being formed, but she never had this happening to her.

Hope everyone is doing well. 

I had surgery on Monday to remove an Osteochondroma from my back and I’ve been prescribed Senna 7.5mg 2 a night and Docusate Sodium 2 x 100mg twice a day. 

I’ve tried having coffee, fibre bars, my ADHD meds (which usually make me go!) but nothing is working and I’m starting to feel nauseous now from not being able to go. 

I am on Dihydrocodeine and OxyCodone for pain relief post op. 

I have some magnesium citrate which I’ll take later today but would anyone know what else I can try? I’m worried it’ll be too painful to go after so long now.

830,AskDocs,"Everything I've read online says that limbs fall asleep when there's pressure on a nerve or vein. I sleep with my arms extended mostly straight, not bent without anything on them. They fall asleep, and get really cold as if there is no circulation. 

Sometimes it happens when I'm sitting up as well resting my arm on an armrest. Sometimes multiples times a night I will have to put my arm down 90 degrees to the floor essentially to get the blood to flow back into them, warm them up, and wake them up from that pins and needles feeling. Holding my arms up to my face for fairly short periods (like to write this post) can also cause it

I have struggled with low BP in the past and hypotension- but I haven't gotten any bad feedback when I get bloodtests or have my BP checked recently- and i always ask. I also don't go into 'zombie' mode or experience blackouts like I did back when my BP was really bad. Most of the time I feel pretty healthy.

I am pregnant right now, but I have been experiencing this forever  I'm 29f, overweight (5'2, 200lbs pre-pregnancy) but most of my excess weight is in my thighs, stomach, breasts and butt. My heart is beating faster even since the baby.

I'm wary of doctors. Everything I've struggled with medically from falling asleep at the wheel (due to hypotension) to yearly kidney stones was always chalked up to me being on my period or ""on drugs"" because I was a teenage (I wasn't- ive never done drugs and even avoid otc pain medication for my constant migraines because my family has a history of drug abuse).

Hello, 26F 5’9 192lbs, i exercise and eat ok, not the best. Current medications are Prozac 20mg, and in the last week I did take acid reflux tablets. Prior conditions are IIH and nocturnal incontinence. 

So I recently went doctors as my boobs looked a bit different so they had a look and they said they were fine but ordered bloods anyways. 
So my bloods at first showed 26 ESR and low white blood cells. 
I had a repeat 3 weeks later and my ESR was 18 and white blood cells normal. 
I had to repeat my ESR as 1-15 is classed as normal, and today I got my results and it was 19. 

I have had a month or two of mild motion sickness like nausea, change in bowel movements (constipated to looser stools with clear mucus) and acid reflux.

I have had in the last two years two random flare ups of hand wrist and finger pain that would last 5 weeks at a time, my last flare was 8 months ago. 
I also have a grandad who got diagnosed with RA at 70 and an auntie with colitis. 


I now have an appointment with a rheumatologist and I’m unsure what to expect. I feel relatively well in myself, is it all down hill from here if I do have RA?

* slightly bloated stomach, my stomach doesn’t feel hard 24/7
* semi constipated 24/7
* stiff neck 24/7
* white tongue at the back with white patches, doesn’t come off even with scraping 24/7
* thight throat like something is stuck 24/7

I had an ultrasound that came back fine. Only thing the doctor noticed was a lot of air in my stomach and intestines. I did an endoscopy that came back normal. Biopsies showed negative for h pylori, gardia and gluten intolerance. (Even if they did take biopsies can they still miss cancer? That is my biggest worry!). I also did a bloodtest 2x. First came back completely normal. Second one showed that my ferritin levels are extremely low (4). My MCV is also slightly low (82.9). Two weeks ago these were fine. So wat changed? I also noticed that i don’t have my period for 3 months now. I’m really scared it is stomach cancer bc all my symptoms match to a T. Doctors don’t want to do any testing anymore bc they keep telling me that everything is normal but i just don’t feel like this is normal. I’m so worried. Nothing works to get rid of these symptoms.

Today, I had a pole vault meet. On my second vault on the height 6’6, I landed on the mat, then I fell backwards, hit my head against the bar (this easily bruised you and very painful to land on) slipped back and landed head first into the box (where you put the pole to jump).

Of course the person who was officiating pole vault immediately called for a trainer/medical to make sure I didn’t have a concussion. They told me to tell them if i had light sensitivity or felt sick to my stomach. I said I felt fine.

I passed the concussion test and was able to continue with the meet. I ended up doing really well and PR in both pole vault and triple jump however I lied to the trainer.

My head hurts like crazy, during tj, I thought I was about to pass out because I was so dizzy and I feel hella sick to my stomach. What should I do, should I go to the school trainer tomorrow and talk to her?

Personal hx of recurrent ear infections (resolved with having tubes placed at 2 years old), frequent nausea and vomiting, migraines, and “anxious character” 



Takes a daily vitamin for immune support. Has PRN hydroxyzine for severe episodes of anxiety. Has sumatriptan nasal spray for a last option in controlling a migraine (have not had to use yet). No other medications. 



He is the youngest of three children. His father and I both have some form of depression/anxiety along with a long family history of mental health issues. He has been nervous since the day he could speak. My older two children didn’t have this issue. He wouldn’t even speak when around new people and would have a total breakdown even as young as 2. We have been working very hard with him and have slowly gotten him to the point where he can go to school and participate most of the time. However he will not speak in front of the class. His teacher has to have him whisper what he wants to say and she addresses the class for him because he will vomit, break down or just completely stop talking altogether when asked to do it. He will read out loud to the class though. He has a little group of friends and plays well with them but when faced with something new, he is an absolute mess. He will hyperventilate and just can’t face it. We have been working with a behavioral therapist on coping techniques and she essentially told me that we’ve done all we can on that end and said we should consider meds. So, his pediatrician started with the hydroxzyine and it’s to be used as needed. We used it for the first time last night. 



He frequently lays in bed and gets fixated on something and then comes and tells us and cries and starts to panic. 



Last night it was “remember 3 years ago when there was a storm while we were on the beach? I thought I was going to get left behind and I can’t stop thinking about it” 



Another night it was “I can’t stop thinking about what would happen if I died. What happens?” 



These are just two examples but it’s like this maybe 1-2 x a week and the issues he brings up are sometimes small (worried about where he’ll turn in something at school) and the heavier things like death. 



His pediatrician’s office was quick to want to put him on medication and the behavioral therapist seems to be limited on what she can do to help but they aren’t providing more resources and I’m extremely concerned about this. I don’t know what to do for him. My parents didn’t even attempt to address my issues and I struggled my entire life.

839,AskDocs,"Hi there, I am a 33 year old female with MS and am on immune suppressing injections that I take every four weeks, started them in early November. I was diagnosed nearly 8 years ago and have been on a few different immune suppressing treatments over the years. Thankfully despite this I haven’t had any issues with vaginal thrush, until recently. On 3rd March I woke up on holiday with very bad thrush symptoms and immediately went to a chemist and sorted a Fluconazole 150mg tablet. I hoped this would get rid of it but when I returned from holiday a few days later I still had symptoms. I rang my GP who immediately began me on a two week course of Fluconazole 50mg a day as she said it was needed with my weakened immune system. Swabs confirmed it was thrush. Long story short since then I have had several courses of fluconazole including 150mg every three days for a week, several pessarys of Clotrimazole 500mg and it still hasn’t gone away. Symptoms at the beginning were severe and for a while now they have been milder but despite ongoing treatment the thrush is still there. I paid to go private and see a gynaecologist a couple weeks ago who examined me etc but unfortunately told me and gave me the same things as the GP which was disappointing. I have also been taking probiotics for vaginal flora for a few weeks and have been reducing my sugar intake. I spoke to my ms team who told me to miss this month’s injection to see if that helps me fight it off, it was meant to be done a couple nights ago so I didn’t take it. I live in the UK and the treatments I have mentioned are the only ones that exist for thrush so I am getting really worried. Also worth mentioning that a GP said to me that even with having a weakened immune system she has never known someone to not have their thrush go away with these treatments which didn’t make me feel much better! I have heard of re-occurring thrush but there is nothing online about thrush that despite treatment doesn’t go away. Dealing with this on top of my MS is starting to take a toll on my mental health.

Hello doctors i m from india where rabies is not so rare. 
In December i got bitten by dog and i took 0,3,7,28 rabies vaccine intradermal (updated thai regimen) completed on 20 jan. On my 2 nd dose i pinched my vaccinated site immediately . On my 3rd dose i rubbed the vaccine site after 20 mins of recieving vaccine. Later i cane to know rubbing should be avoided as vaccine is delivered in dermis so it can impact its absorbtion. During my course i drank alcohol only one time . Will all these incidents affect the effectiveness of vaccine?! On 24 march i got scratched by dog which later died after 17 days due to rabies . So i went to govt hospital they didn't gave any vaccine as according to their protocol no rabies booster are required if exposure happens within 6 months of completing pep . Nevertheless i went to well recognised hospital where i was told i m covered for 3 months due to previous shot. So due to fear i took 0,3,7 id (who new id pep schedule)from private clincic and after last dose got severe allergic reaction . I m just lost dont know what to do .

852,AskDocs,"TLDR is it worth getting tested for drug allergies?

31F, daily bupropion 100mg, also elvanse 30mg but not before the surgery

I recently had a coronectomy under full anaesthesia (in the UK, but not through the NHS) and got a sudden chest rash shortly after I was put under.

The drugs given to me were Fentanyl, propofol, clindamycin, ondansetron, Dexamethasone, and rocuronium.

I was told it was likely a mild allergic reaction to one of the drugs (the anaesthetist believes it was the rocuronium) and was recommended I get tested to confirm this. Supposedly the rash was from histamine release and not too dangerous.

I grew up abroad and as a child I had a significant rash on half my body after taking penicillin so I was told I have an allergy and should not be given penicillin again. 

This is in my medical records in the UK and I mention it when I’m asked about allergies. However a few doctors said to me that I might not have a genuine allergy and the rash might have been a side effect. 

1. Is it worth for me to do allergy testing to confirm if I am actually allergic to penicillin and/or anaesthetics? My GP said they wouldn’t do this on the NHS and we will just keep a note in my file. Happy to pay for it privately if needed but don’t want to spend hundreds of pounds on unnecessary tests. 
2. If I don’t get tested, and it is a ‘mild’ allergy, could I get an anaphylactic shock during an emergency surgery in the future?

back in Feb i went to the ER because i woke up that morning with wheezing and it progressively got worse throughout the day to the point where talking would have me out of breath or simply walking up a small flight of stairs. when i would lie down it was significantly harder to breathe. they did a breathing treatment, prescribed me albuterol and prednisone for 3 days. i still had wheezing after a few weeks so i went to the campus clinic and she prescribed me a longer cycle of prednisone as well as some antibiotics thinking it was maybe an infection or something that died in me. 

it worked for a while but now i’m having wheezing again. i went on a run for the first time in a long time a few days ago and now my wheezing is back. i also am congested practically all the time. i have two ferrets and i’m not sure if i have allergies and this is all due to that. sometimes i’ll have a dry cough and sneeze and will have a metallic taste in my mouth. i saw an ENT back in January for snoring problems and congestion but it felt very rushed and useless tbh and i did not feel like that did anything for me.

Last Thursday, I started feeling a pain around my upper left back, though for the first day or two I thought it may have been heart pain as was radiating around. I’m fairly sure it is my back now, though. I have had no injury I’m aware of, the last time I trained upper body before the pain was Tuesday and all was fine Wednesday. Since then, I have taken days off all exercise, used ibuprofen &amp; paracetamol, ice packs, Epsom salts, foam rollers. Whilst this provides temp relief, it hasn’t felt like it’s improving day by day. The pain doesn’t actually feel muscular- I’ve been through every back stretch, every ROM, and nothing triggers it or makes it worse. Could it still be muscular despite this, or what else could it be?

I'll be short for the sake of clarity.

So my husband has lived in Africa from ages 5 to 8. One fine day he gets back from school, and with his father discovers this really engorged tick on his hip. He said his dad poured gasoline on the tick and disinfected the wound. He still has a really evident scar from the tick bite.

Now he's 28. For the last 3 years he's been having a lot of pain in his joints and leg bones. A really bad bout of this happened in late summer of 2020, when he couldn't even move his hand and his thumb was thrice its size. He works in IPM and uses his hands a lot, so he had to take a leave for a week because of it.

After a thorough exam with a specialised doctor (he also had imaging done, which showed a lot of liquid in the joint), the doc basically said: ""it definitely looks like arthritis, but I can't (read: won't take the responsibility) diagnose you with it because you're far too young to have it. If it comes back in the near future, we'll see what we can do""

He's been having loads of leg pain lately, and he just said to me that he used to have these pains pretty frequently growing up, sometimes even preventing him from sleeping. 

He usually complains about hip, wrist, and thumb pain. His mom is a doctor (and she worked in Africa for quite some time, so she's quite informed), and sometimes she brings up the possibility of an exam to reveal if this is stemming from the tick bite, or if it is just bad luck with his joints. She unfortunately wasn't present when the bite happened.

Patient deceased with bilateral Pulmonary Thrombo-Emboli. Exploration of the deep calf veins in both legs failed to reveal any deep venous thromboses. The Thrombo-Emboli (many,  currently undefined amount) were in the parenchyma of both lungs and were solid, branched and strongly adherent to the underlying blood vessels. 

There is no evidence of infarction anywhere on the lungs. Post-Mortem describes the individual as healthy in every aspect. Anecdotally the individual was fit, strong and active. There was no clotting anywhere else in the body. 

Deceased had recently had ORIF surgery for a broken clavicle 2 weeks prior to death. 

What are your thoughts on why this person died?

871,AskDocs,"I’ll just cut to the chase- I did a decent amount of different prescription / OTC drugs from the ages of 13-15. 

Including: Vicodin (Lortab) anywhere from 1-15 pills of usually the highest dosage, klonopin anywhere from 1-7ish mg at a time, very large doses of cough medicine (again up to like 14 of the highest dose of mucinex DM, a memory worth mentioning is that i stopped after an incident where i got stuck in a high and saw double for 2 days straight), and unknown doses of methadone, gabapentin, RX amphetamines, and muscle relaxers. Sometimes by themselves, sometimes a cocktail of any combo of these. Definitely had several negative experiences like getting really sick, stomach pain, vomiting and incontinence at times.
Before anyone brings it up, I know this was absolutely unsafe and not okay; I had a lot of mental health issues as well at the time and I did receive long term rehabilitation for these behaviors when i was 15. 10 years later after many lessons learned, I am now a mindful adult who knows my limits. I’m really just here to ask- could i have potentially done any damage to my organs during this time? For a while I thought I just fried my brain, but after talking to a friends roommate who is a med student, it seems more likely that the longterm damage would’ve occurred in my liver, kidneys or GI tract, especially with the amount of tylenol I must’ve consumed. I have definitely experienced weird unexplainable auto-immune type symptoms through my 20s but no definitive answers and i previously attributed them to other factors like family history and past/diagnosed illnesses. 

So, TL;DR: How likely am I to have permanent organ damage after doing a lot of prescription/otc drugs &amp; likely thousands of mgs of tylenol in the process, as a 13-15 year old?",t2_b8setu8,0,"just curious, how badly did i (24f) f*ck my body up from drugs as a kid?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12ss7m2,True,pajama_samm,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12ss7m2/just_curious_how_badly_did_i_24f_fck_my_body_up/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12ss7m2/just_curious_how_badly_did_i_24f_fck_my_body_up/,476081,1681981960,0,,False,1681981970,1681981971,2023-04-20 09:12:40,,,
872,AskDocs,"Hello, I am a 19 year old female. For some medical background, I have anemia that's getting treated with iron infusions, just had one 5 days ago. I am also being evaluated for the possibility of POTS as almost every time I stand up, I'm very lightheaded and even had a fainting spell a few weeks back, its been like this for about 5 months now, a daily occurance. But also for months now, sometimes my heart hurts, just randomly and the doctors have done an EKG and everything seems normal, but that was taken in January. It's a daily thing for my heart to hurt, its a dull ache but still noticeable, it's always brief though, like 2 minutes. Doctors have also tried to pin anxiety on it which is valid, but it happens when I'm completely content with no nervousness at all. The other day, I had heart palpations and heart pain together and I was very scared, as I've had both, but never together. Is this possibly related to POTS? Sometimes my left arm feels like blood is trying to rush in it, but also feels like an artery or vein is cold in my bicep, I don't quite know how to explain it, like minimal reduced blood flow i suppose, but it happens after the heart pains usually. Doctors are evaluating my results for pots and are considering doing more cardiac workup including a zio patch (which i hope i get honestly to get some awnsers) For more background, there is no history of early cardiac issues in my family. Also these are the results of my vitals being taken for pots, just in case is possibly proves worthy of anything.

Last year I started getting small I guess blisters? In my right wrist/lower palm. It's the hand I use the computer mouse with and gets infinitely worse when I'm using the computer a lot. GP suggested it might be contact dermatitis and prescribed Clotrizone but it was also very hard to show him as it comes and goes. I wrap the wrist with a paper towel and wear a sleeve to hold it there and it usually gets better(never completely gone)and the cream seems to have no effect.Again it has only been happening for a year and I've been using a computer regularly for the last 20 so I'm not sure why it's suddenly happening now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of getting a second look at it but figured maybe it really is just that and someone could advise me on whether it's worth the trouble.

I'm a healthy 22 yesr old male and have been staying in rural Thailand for 3 weeks. In the last 5 days I've had a rash start appearing all on my upper body. Its a lot of small red dots, some of them seem to have a bit of pus but that has gone down after a day or two. The mark stills seems to remain though.

It doesn't itch at all, but the rate it came up made me think it's worth asking about. I haven't been drinking a lot, and Ive been showering 2-3 times a day the whole duration. It is extremely hot here at the moment 34 - 38 degress celcius.

I'm heading back down to Bangkok in 2 days, I'm not sure if there's a cream I should get from a pharmacy or if it's worth going to see a doctor while I'm on holiday, or just waiting till I'm home in Australia on the 28th.

879,AskDocs,"My doctor just says 'peeing slows down with age' but i'm finding that i am peeing at half speed - sometimes slow enough that i barely feel it at the tip. This has been over about a year, stable. Then when i stand up after a minute, there's a reload. If i wait for a couple minutes after peeing i can pee again for a small volume - if i don't, i can feel it at the tip (of the urethra), that urge to pee, but not necessarily a feeling of fullness in the bladder.

I have one minor incident of kidney injury when i was 8 y.o. and hit by a car but returned to normal by end of hospital stay, and  there was nothing detected in the urinalysis except even after waiting two hours it was slightly low concentration (doctor opted to not repeat the test). Prostate exam was done and described by the doctor as normal.

Could this be some sort of aggravation in the urethra itself? I have an ingrown hair with dark grey bruise in the pubic area (the hair area up from the penis), no bump, no pus, and if i squeeze it, just a lot of blood. I've opted to leave it alone as a grey blotch. Doctor has seen it, says it's just an ingrown hair that's being squeezed because of my obesity.

Blood sugar was 5.4, perfectly in range. Triglycerides were slightly out of range as a result of being fat. (Barely out of range)

Any ideas? I don't think my doc is particularly worried by it but half speed peeing bothers me.. i'm secretly worried about some tentacle shaped tumor wrapped around my bladder waiting to strike, or that i've got a deadly neuromuscular disease.

No pain or other symptoms related to this (i have sleep apnea and it's well treated, and acid reflux(Treated with Prevacid), probably from being obese with sleep apnea and it's treated).

I'm, 22 year old male, otherwise healthy with no underlining condition as far as I know, going to join the French Foreign Legion this summer. For those who don't know and wonder the legion is a part of the French army that accepts foreign volunteers from all over the world.

After conducting some research it appears, not at all surprising, that during selection you receive a cocktail assortment of different vaccinations. Among those is also the COVID vaccine. 

I'm vaccinated and boosted up to date, but from the information I could gather both from their official sources as well as people who serve(d) they vaccinate even those who've received it already. (Apparently as many join from 3rd world countries there's a certain distrust in the authenticity or validity of proof provided from these candidates so they just vaccinate everyone again to be sure).

My question is: is it OK to receive a second dose of the COVID vaccine (not a booster but the initial vaccine itself)? Also same applies for receiving a second dose of other vaccines I might have recently received such as hepatitis c for example?

893,AskDocs,"I just got over what I think was a cold that started with a funny feeling in my throat that evolved into a sore throat, runny nose, and a headache. Also felt with my snot changing colors a bit and spitting up phlegm. After a week or two I started feeling better and thought I was going to be fine.

Not even just a couple days later I got the funny feeling in my throat again and it’s evolved into a sore throat again. However, I really think it’s the top of the uvula hurts (where it connects to roof of my mouth) whenever I swallow. And then I started occasionally coughing up this disgusting tasting thick phlegm that would have blood in the middle of it. Now this last day or two I’ve also gained a headache on one side of my head that seems like it has its own heartbeat it’s killing me when I move too much. I also don’t have a running nose or anything one nose is kinda clogged but the other is completely fine I’m breathing perfectly ok.


The only other issue I have that I think I should mention is my belly button has also been oozing this foul smelling substance so I’ve been trying to make sure I wash it out better. I recently found out there was a scab in there but idk why it’s not completely healing I have 0 clue if it’s related but I thought I should mention it.


Do I just have bad luck and should just pop some pain medicine and cough syrup?

about a year or so ago i was dealing with stroke-like symptoms. it was extremely bizarre and episodic. sometimes the symptoms would approach seizure-like symptoms. sometimes it would last for up to 3 days non-stop. sometimes it would happen and I’d feel normal again an hour later. I was 23 at the time so some of my family members acted like my bf was an idiot when he felt he should bring me to the hospital so I ended up not going immediately. after the ~8th day of an episode starting again, i went to the ER. 

they did a CT scan because they suspected stroke. came back normal. and everything in my blooodwork came back normal except i saw that my triglyceride levels had been flagged. they were at 23 mg/dL. i only saw this after leaving the hospital, so i never got any explanation. eventually, the episodes stopped happening. but ive always wondered if i should go and get checked out to make sure there’s nothing seriously wrong. but i couldn’t really find much online about low triglyceride levels, only high.

I was wondering how she was able to develop ascites since she does not drink at all and the doctor cleared her of any liver issues.

We are all worried as she's not been sleeping well although she has gained back some of her strength after starting the meds. She's on her 7th day on meds. 

Will this still reverse with the meds? We still aren't sure why she suddenly developed it.

2 days ago it started hurting whenever I used it for anything that applies pressure onto it. I'm just rather worried if it's anything that could potentially cause harm? I don't know much about medicine and if this post gets taken down I'm fine with it, just rather be safe than sorry. 
So I feel the pain in my bone, not the actual arm itself but instead exactly where the bone bent and whenever I stretch or stand up off of my chair it really hurts, not to an extent where it's ""god I can't stand it"" and more like in an irritating way.

After receiving oral from a woman, I felt ill 2 days after the encounter, flu like symptoms, extremely tired and malaise. I recovered from that quickly but after 5 days, started to have the urge to urinate more frequently and a slight burn.

At 5 days I tested negative for Gon and Chla. At this time I visited my first doctor, I received Nitrofurian, which did not improve my symptoms.

At 8 days, I tested negative again for Gon and Chla and was given Minocycline (7days) for possible NSU. This is when I started to have back flank pain and the urgency to urinate and burning had become relentless.

At 21 days, I took a standard 10 Panel std test and was negative for everything except hsv1, which was expected.

Urine culture was negative. I was given 10 days Cipro, at this point I started to have spots and irritation on my glans. I was given a cream for this issue that seemed to keep it at bay. Started to have arthritis in my knees.

A month in, I saw a new doctor, I started to have a pinching pain in my testicles, I had PSA test, Gon and Chla negative test, trans rectal scan and bladder scan negative. took an over the counter pill for yeast infection in case this was a fungal issue. I was given Tamsulosin for a few weeks and that seemed to calm the frequent urge to urinate.

At 56 days, I tested negative for Syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma Hominis / Ureaplasma urealyticum, trich and Gon/Chla. I was given Naproxen, Flomax and Cipro again for a month. The pain in both my testicles was killing me and had slight swelling in my epididymis.

At 68 days tested negative for kidney scan, scrotal scan, bladder scan, this is when I started to have a pressure pain in my lower abdomen/pelvic region. The pain mostly came on when sitting.

At 110 days, full std panel negative again. The pain in my abdomen and testicles became excruciating to the point I went to emerge. Urine and blood negative and I was put on 2 weeks of doxycycline which helped with my testicle pain. Scrotal scan revealed swelling behind testicles.

At 120 days, finally was referred to a Urologist, full urine and blood negative, full std panel negative. I started to have dribbling after urination that seemed to be irritating the glans. My urgency to urinate was gone but still had pain in testicles and pelvis. I would have pressure in testicles after ejaculating as well.
After finishing, my testicle pain returned and pelvis pain became worse. Arthritis in knees began to flare up again.

Inguinal ultrasound scan showed possible hernia, but doctor said they are not reliable, urine analysis was negative. No urgency to urinate or burning. Just pain in lower abdomen and testicles. Waiting for a cystoscopy in two weeks.

921,AskDocs,"F34, 171cms, 62kg. 

I don't want to get into all the details, but a few years ago, I had epiglottitis and nearly died. I had an awful experience in a&amp;e. My nurse refused to give the medications the Dr ordered for hours. I genuinely thought I was going to die. I couldn't even swallow my spit. I couldn't ask for help because I couldn't speak. My temperature was 41. I was in agony and left alone, without monitoring, in a covid ward (i didnt have covid, but i had fever, so they stuck me there). The nurse was really cruel and clearly burnt out. The nurse was since sacked, but I am now utterly terrified of the emergency dept.

I have ongoing medical issues, mostly cardiac. I also take seizures, but don't know what causes them. Each time I've had a seizure, my blood glucose has been between 2-3. I had an eeg last year, but the neurologist left and I've not been followed up since.

I absolutely will not attend a&amp;e of my own accord. A few days ago, I was brought by ambulance after a few successive seizures. The ambulance gave me rectal diazepam. I was on the phone with a friend when it started (no warning). The next thing I knew, I was in resuss, no memory of anything in-between. As soon as I was capable of putting one foot in front of the other, I was out of there. I got a taxi home and have been sleeping it off since. 

A month ago, I had a tia. Earlier that day, I had an appointment at the drs for bloods and an ecg. My heart rate was 171. I've no idea what the ecg said, but the nurse said I had to wait to see a doctor. I sat there and she came back 10mins later to say the Dr said just to keep the appointment with her on Monday (this was a friday). She said it was likely just because of caffeine. I didn't have any caffeine in me. I took the stroke that evening. CT confirmed it, but I refused to stay for further testing. I wasn't frightened of the results, I was frightened of the staff.

In July last year, I had a heart attack. I was sent home from a&amp;e and was told I was fine, just having an anxiety attack, but then got a call saying my tropinin was elevated and to come back. I refused. 

I can't describe the danger I feel when I am in that department. It terrifies me. The thing is though, given that I am out like a shot, even if it means crawling out the door, I've not stayed once for any kind of work up or investigations. I have completely lost faith in the medical profession, which hasn't been helped by the fact that the NHS is broken and the small local hospital is in shambles. They are well known for avoidable deaths, even before covid. 

I've become really hostile with medical professionals. It's not bitterness, it's because I am terrified. If I took another heart attack and was alone, I wouldn't seek help. I'd sooner die than go and put my life in their hands. If I am conscious, I am out of there. I don't trust them at all.

I am really unwell now. I spend most days in bed all day. My quality of life is crap. Just standing causes my hr to bounce up to at least 140 and the pressure in my head makes the bridge of my nose crack (what's that about?) and my ears to whoosh with my pulse. I was diagnosed with pure autonomic failure a few years ago and I'm on ivabridine twice a day for it. To be fair, it doesn't seem to do an awful lot, but is useful for SVTs when they happen. 

Since the tia, I've not been able to stop crying. I've an MRI on the 28th. I'm so sick of being sick and hate that so much of my life is taken up by health crap. I feel hopeless. I don't know how to change my outlook. I'm that asshole patient you hate to see coming. 

I've made contact with a therapist and start with them tomorrow. 

I recently was changed from sertraline to duloxetine. I haven't taken a seizure in a long time. According to the Dr, the ambulance people said I took about 6 seizures?! AFAIK, nothing like that has happened before. Naturally, I'm angry with the GP for prescribing duloxetine given my seizure history and I'm blaming her. I'm well aware how ridiculous this might seem, but it does feel like a lot of the time, these people do more harm than good. My faith in medical professionals is gone. 

I hate all of this. I don't know what to do. Avoiding medical professionals is doing my health no favours, but engaging with them seems equally dangerous. I know how irrational this must all sound. I've tried so hard to just calm down, but I get so frantic and just need to gtfo. This is very different from how I usually behave. I'm really not helping myself.

Where do I start in trying to address my health issues? It would be great if I could just be knocked out for a few days while whatever tests/treatments were done and I was woke up and waved home.

I received a strep throat diagnosis at an urgent care clinic on April 3rd using a rapid IDNOW machine. The prescribing doctor sent me home with penicillin 2 times daily for 10 days. 

Throughout taking the antibiotics and since then, I kept having these symptoms:

- Ulcer developed within the roof of my mouth, in back near throat/tonsil. Very painful for the first few days, I treated it with viscous lidocaine and then OTC benzocaine.
- Recurring low grade fever every 24 hours. Would improve for 8-10 hours then return. Within the ballpark of 99-101 degrees Fahrenheit, throughout all 16 days on/off.
- Muscle aches, coughing, and difficulty breathing would accommodate my fever. I would try to treat it with Tylenol when it was most difficult.

Unfortunately once I finished my first round of antibiotics which was penicillin, I was then diagnosed with a UTI. So immediately after I began to take Keflex (Cephalexin) three times daily starting from the 13th of April.

I finally decided to see my primary care doctor this Tuesday, the 18th, to discuss my symptoms. My primary care doctor called out for that day, so I ended up seeing another practicioner within the clinic. She admitted she wasn’t sure what was wrong with me, but after inspecting my throat it was very clearly still inflamed and red, along with the ulcer. She swabbed me for culture samples, and then told me her best guess was that I just have a very bad case of the flu, and that I most likely never had strep, and that the rapid diagnosis was a false positive. 

She sent me home telling me to stop taking the Keflex and start Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin) two times daily, which I started last night on the 18th. Since then, I seem to have developed another symptom or side effect of the medication, where I now have red dots all over my legs. They’re not itchy at all or raised, they’re flush with the skin, but a sore sight to see for the first time!

Unfortunately I’m just having a hard time being sick when I have work and school, and Tylenol can only be efficient for so long. I would appreciate it if any physician could point me in the right direction in terms of treatment, as it seems my primary care clinic doesn’t know what to do with me.

I have been having on and off loose stools for about 3 weeks now. I know diarrhea is a side effect of Pantoprazole but this started before I started taking it :/ my stools are often brown or yellow tinged and yellow when I wipe. They are usually soft and/or mushy but not full diarrhea if that makes sense? No mucus or blood in the stool. There is sometimes bright red blood when I wipe but my doctor said I have two anal fissures and I definitely feel them when they occur. I also have been having weird chest sensations that feel like esophagus spasms that make breathing feel difficult. Sometimes this is accompanied by flushing skin and high heart rate (180-200bpm). I went to the ER for the shortness of breath and heart rate and my O2 levels were fine and my heart rate had come down (to like 120-150bpm) by the time they did an ecg and it was just sinus tachycardia. These episodes often end in lots of belching and a bowel movement

I did a stool test back in January and no blood or parasites or mucus was found.  But I didn’t have the diarrhea back then. Last week I had my liver enzymes, pancreatic enzymes, and kidney function checked and everything was normal. My electrolytes were normal. My urine was normal. The only thing abnormal is that my iron levels are low.

To make a long story short, I’ve been dealing with an extremely chronic sinus infection for over 2 years (untreated and then misdiagnosed). Was given a short course of antibiotics in January, that improved symptoms for a week before they came back with a vengeance. Saw an ENT in March after suffering for nearly two months with debilitating sinus/ head pain, she prescribed the following: predniSONE 20mg for 12 days, doxycycline hyclate 100mg twice daily for 21 days, and twice daily neilmed sinus rinse with an added steroid once a day until I see her next in may. 

I had pretty much every common side effect listed for those medications, but the worst ones were constant light-headedness, worsened headaches, stomach issues, mild chest pain/difficulty breathing. My sinusitis symptoms worsened for a while but seem (?) to be improving slightly now?

The problem I’m having now is mental, not physical. I’m a college student in a difficult degree. High school I was always straight As, now I’m mostly Bs and a few Cs. I was already having a rough semester because of the debilitating sinus issues, but even though they’ve improved I’m in a worsened mental state. I have no motivation. I’m forgetful. I can’t focus. I can’t retain information. I’m barely keeping all Cs right now and I’m fucking terrified of losing my scholarship/not being able to follow my ideal career path, but the fear isn’t enough of a motivator. I was struggling before, but now it seems to be worse. Today I was so hyperfocused on completing an (extremely overdue) assignment that I forgot to go to an important class *and* also forgot to eat lunch and dinner. I just can’t get my shit together, all I want to do is lay down and stare at the ceiling all day. 

Maybe it’s a silly question but I just need help. Could this sudden change in my mental state have anything to do with my sinus infection or the medication I was on? Also, the woman who prescribes my antidepressants (idk her title) wanted to increase the dose of both my zoloft and vyvanse, but I declined at the time because I was already putting so much medication into my body.

Hello
I'm writing this in hopes of reaching someone that perhaps might have insight or suggestion on what my issue could be. 
In November 2021 I started experiencing memory and vision issues suddenly. I also lost my sense of smell. Got covid tested, negative test. Never hit my head. 
My short term memory is dysfunctional, as of current I can barely recall what occurred the previous day, it's stressful. 
For vision changes, it seems I have symptoms of Visual Snow that developed suddenly. 
Since November 2021 I have experienced abnormal uncomfortable feeling of pressure within my head, localized on just the right side. It feels like I have something stuck within the middle of head near my right ear and sinus area. When I breathe or drink it feels like the air or drink travel up my inner ear/(eustachian tube?). I don't feel stuffy or congested in my nose or sinus.
My pcp referred me to a neurologist in January 2022. I got an MRI of my head and neck as well as an EEG. Everything was clear. Saw an ophthalmologist in February 2022 for my vision changes and they found nothing either, they sugguested it was migraines but I'm pretty sure that is not what I'm experiencing. It's less of a headache type pain and more of a noticeable sensation of pressure within my head. 
I started seeing an ENT in March 2022; got a ct scan and MRI of my sinuses. ENT said I had some inflammation and post nasal drip. I tried Flonase which unfortunately did not improve anything. 
For the rest of the year I tried physical and behavioral therapy, going on walks everyday, diet changes, magnesium, omega 3, herbal teas, meditation, nasal irrigation, a round of amoxicillin. No improvement after all these months 😞. It seems all my efforts to regain a sense of normal health have been in vain, my symptoms remain and I feel like I am just crazy despite knowing that something is definitely affecting my body. I am demoralized. I feel weaker each day and have lost a lot of hope. 
Apologies for the long post, thank you for reading.

978,AskDocs,"Hello,

If i could tell my story here i would very much appreciate it. I have finally confronted myself with my declining health and i am ready to speak about it and take action. I apologize if this is not the right place to do it, but i also had some questions at the end about COPD and about further possible actions i could take. Skip to TLDR for questions.

\-M 34, 178cm, 85kg. Belgium. Born prematurely without frontal sinuses and crooked existing ones. I also had a cardiovascular condition at birth that doctors had never seen before, i was dubbed a Harlequin baby, as only half my body was provided with bloodflow and it looked funny . Being sick regularly with flu was never a joke, always very painfull, brown secretion with every cough and fever nightmares/hallucinations.

Diagnosed with ADD at 6/7, and dealing with more emotions than most kids i started to smoke weed and tobacco since i was 13 to replace the ADD meds. I had bad phases of excessive smoking and lots of marihuana usage, also everyone at home smoked tobacco and/or weed, Sister/parents/friends. My younger brother was diagnosed with asthma so he never touched smoking, even joined the military. 110% lung capacity he boasted.

My mother was diagnosed with COPD from smoking in 2002 and received a lung transplant in 2006, and of course the whole household shifted around living healthy, by then i was living alone in an appartment and my bad habits continued.

I remember being out of breath the very first year of smoking, age 14/15, i was athletic but my chest burned and my head hurt when i tried to push myself. I ignored it as i did with so many things. But slowly and surely my bicycle cardio would wither down also. As this was my main form of transport, i got myself checked at 18- max 20 yrs old, and the spirometer said i had around 70% lung capacity.

Refusing to believe it, my mental self defense made me exercise more and helped me forget about it. 

Untill one day i was swimming in a lake, and i almost drowned. I will never forget it. All my friends were swimming and laughing and talking to each other while paddling their feet. And i made it to about half way the lake and had to go back due to oxygen shortage. My ego refused to ask for help and i fought my way back, exhausted i pulled myself to land and i remember every muscle being dead, breathing heavily and having trouble with breathing as if i couldn't breathe fast enough. But i did recuperate faster than expected, advantage of being somewhat musculary fit?

Slowly but surely i get more complaints, as i also gain weight from bodybuilding and abusing steroids from 25 till 31. And in 2019 i almost pass out during a heavy activity, suddenly a tight chest, heart rate trough the roof and losing balance, breathing heavy.. heavy heartbeat, no space for my organs to function it felt like. Afterwards i get more and more chest inflammations and this weird unpure feeling in my throat and airways, also i feel that my heart beats way faster and heavier than it used to do. In the gym i am exhausted when i train legs, hard to catch my breath after a heavy set of 12-15 reps and cardio i can only do for 10 to 15 minutes before my legs die, so i never do it again because it depresses me to no end. Still i train 5/6 out of 7 days.

After contracting a bad case of Covid and losing all sense of smell, taste and getting tinittus, i have visited the doctor for a spiro test to measure lung volume, he forwarded me to a lung specialist as he measured my volume around 65-70%

The specialist said to me that i COULD likely have COPD, first they want me to quit smoking and buy/apply RELVAR medication, I think asthma medication? After i am able to quit smoking i had to go back she said, to diagnose correctly. This is the same specialist that helped my mother and supervised her transplant surgery.

I Have quit cigarettes since my visit to that doctor in 2020, but i still smoke weed. I used to smoke 10 to 15 joints a day, now only 1 joint without tobacco and a cigarette filter so i can sleep, during the day i sometimes vape from a mighty+ and Volcano device, as the brand is renowned and used in health care. i triple filter the smoke trough water and frozen coils. 

Still i feel i need to do way more, and i hope, oh i hope...that it's just asthma,.. i would grab the chance with both hands and feet, and never touch anything again with smoke, i'll make edibles instead and do cardio every day.

&amp;#x200B;

\--TLDR--:

For respiratory recovery, healing, stabilization. Are things like stem cell therapy viable? Ozone therapy? Steroids or peptides? Cleansing or medication routines? I will make an appointment with the specialist but i want to go prepared and cleansed, for the volume test and or pictures. Also should i lose muscle?

I want the best of the best, I am prepared to invest into this, and to change my habits and never look back, or to deal with the condition if it's too progressed

I read that intensive cardio everyday can improve lung volume by 10-15%, is this true or is it lung function and that's not the same then? Or does this Percentage of gain/recovery not apply to copd and/or asthma patients?

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards,

thank you

Hi,

So I always thought my ejaculation volume was kind of weak, so i started measuring the volumes.


Here is what I measured from last week

Monday: 2.5 ML after 9 hrs of abstinence
Wednesday: 7.5 ML after 48 hrs of abstinence 
Thursday: 6 ML after 24 hrs of abstinence 
Friday: 5.5 ML after 9 hrs of abstinence 
Friday: 2.5 ML after 6 hrs of abstinence
Saturday: 6 ML after 24 hrs of abstinence

The time between was very rough and i drank plenty of water that week.

Hyperspermia is considered anything over 5.5 ML, but i feel what i produced is not even a lot.

Its also very watery too, is there anyway to make it more thick and creamy?

Relevant info:
Age: 21
Erect length: 7.6”

dont smoke dont drink dont do drugs   


hello i'm asking how to be taken seriously my issue is that i was injured in the military about 4 years ago now and had to medically leave i was very immobile and bed ridden for 18 months and i gained a lot of weight about 65kg but when i was back on my feet and mobile i couldn't lose it again   


now the thing is? i lost 60kg already when i was 18 i know what to eat i know how much to work i am doing everything right but nothing i do works   


the time i will loose weight is if 90% of my diet is made up with nutrition supplement shakes and im doing at least 3 hours of combined cardio and 2 hours of weights a day   


there is something wrong i know my body and i know that something is not right the last time i lost weight (even going back to previous diet and routine exactly) i lost weight very rapidly and then it slowed up a bit for the last 4 ish months   


ive seen 3 doctors now the problem i am having is if you tell them that you are eating right and exercising they pretty much just wont listen to you they assume you are lying or not being truthful statements like ""Well thats just not possible or you would see results"" (though one did note that i was unusually ""fit"" and muscular for my size) i am also having the following problems   


if i eat at a deficit about 1800 calories a day i will gain weight   


if i eat at a deficit and exercise normally so maybe 1-2 hours a day no rest days i will just maintain weight     


after almost 2 and a half years of exercising daily intensely i am wearing my body out and my weight is getting large enough that im now finding it hard to walk around my house im starting to get desperate   


obesity clinics here at least are not places you can just walk into you NEED some kind of referral and most of the doctors i have seen assume i am not serious about wanting to loose weight so they wont write me one

I really hope this just health anxiety after quitting daily Nicotine (1 cig at night and chain vape all day), DXM, THC-O, HHC, D9 Bud, Caffeine, and occasional psychs, kratom, and liquor for abt 2 years all cold turkey. Aside from 1 relapse with DXM with liquor, I am 15 days sober. I am under extreme stress and live with my brother and mother who both hate me, don’t love me and are schizophrenic so I have a lot of stress from that and work full time. Every night I’ve been having panic attacks about my heart. I can’t tell if it’s anxiety or if something is actually wrong with my heart. The first few night I could physically feel a weird pulse in the left side of my chest it felt and looked like a weird heart beat + like bubbles in belly if that makes sense. That went away but my heart paranoia and problems have not. Before this I could bike from philly to cape may and back, 100 miles there and back no problem. I was in shape and lost around 120 pounds (when I was mostly sober). Now after quitting I can barely walk outside without feeling my heart beating extremely fast and when I put my hand on my neck it just feels like extremely fast and I have to sit down. It feels like my heart is going to pop in my chest and I feel a pressure and heart rate in my chest. I have tried seeing a psychiatrist or any mental health but no one will take my insurance CHIP and when I called mobile crisis they couldn’t help either. If it helps my thumb doesn’t reach over my palm so hopefully not an aortic aneurysm? Idk can someone just tell me that seeing my heart beat in my chest like that is normal?

994,AskDocs,"Hi, I (31F) did some blood tests after having gastro/joint symptoms (in addition to some chronic skin and back pain issues I suspect might be caused by celiac as well) and found I had antibodies to gluten/other markers of possible celiac disease. I tried to get an endoscopy done a few months ago in Brazil and they couldn’t complete it - they told me they gave me high levels of the sedation meds but it was too light for me and I resisted the procedure. It was a mixture of Fentanyl, Propofol, and midazolam. The doctor who tried to do the endoscopy and another GI doctor I talked to afterwards told me it was because I take seroquel as a sleep aid (at that time it was a higher dose, prob 75-109mg. I reduced it and am now taking about 25mg a night). 

I’m in Mexico now and want to get off seroquel and try the endoscopy again. I just saw a psychiatrist who seemed to have zero interest in what I had to say, told me that seroquel was not the culprit for my tolerance/resistance to the sedation meds (it is my “uncommon” brain, apparently), and was just focused on putting me on other psych meds/offering me alternative treatments, etc. 

I left the consult feeling extremely angry and frustrated, completely unheard. I know patients googling and thinking they know more than medical professionals are infuriating, but I did see some info about this online (combined with other doctors telling me sedative medications like this affect how you respond to anesthesia/sedation).
