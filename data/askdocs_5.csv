Some things were elevated and some were low when I asked her about it she assured me that unless it was extremely high or extremely low it wasn’t something to worry about basically.

I was told to keep steri strips on until day 14 where I could remove them in the shower. Family doc removed a few of them over the area of concern to assess. She swabbed the incision (results back next week), placed clean gauze over it and prescribed fucidin topical cream which I’m using 2x a day. 
The bleeding has since worsened and the incision itself looks swollen or as if it is starting to open up. I will try to post a photo below.

5,AskDocs,"Hi! Seven months ago I contracted chlamydia. My treatment with antibiotics caused a microflora disorder and thrush. I treated thrush with suppositories, but after treatment I still have burning sensation during sex, dryness and redness at the vaginal opening. Instead of sending me for tests, my doctor prescribed more suppositories for thrush and vaginosis. I used them for 10 days and they did not help at all. Then I was tested for microflora, which revealed a lack of lactobacilli and bacterial vaginosis. I was prescribed treatment in the form of suppositories for vaginosis (10 days) and lactobacilli in the form of suppositories after antibiotic therapy (for the same 10 days). In addition, the gynecologist recommended that after a course of treatment, if there is still dryness, to use for another 10 days the hormonal drug Triozhinal (Composition: 341 mg of lyophilized culture of lactobacilli Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus (GG) Doderleini (equivalent to × 108 - 2 × 109 CFU of viable lactobacteria), 0.2 mg of estriol, 2 mg of progesterone. Active ingredient concentration (mg): 343.2 mg). It is usually prescribed to women during menopause (and I am 23y.o.), but the gynecologist said that it can also be used to restore microflora. Five days after I started taking it I got a bad pain in the lower back and a tight pain in the abdomen, and then I started to have bleeding like menstruation. Today is day 25 of my cycle, normally my cycle is 33-35 days. 

As a result, the burning and redness problem has not gone away. There are still red areas at the vaginal entrance that look like chafing, and sex continues to be painful (mechanical damage is ruled out, as there have only been two sexual intercourse in the last 2-3 months) . On top of all this added bleeding and pain in the lower back. I can not be cured for six months.

Can you tell me what the problem may be? Why the redness at the vaginal opening does not go away after treatment? When I touch them I get a burning and stinging sensation, as if the top layer of tissue has been removed. I am also wondering if the last drug could have caused an early onset of my periods, or if it has caused uterine bleeding and I need to rush to the doctor?

Last week I tested positive for covid for the first time via a rapid antigen test. The timeline started on Saturday 08/04 and had a light cough, then a heavier cough, then a phlegmy cough, then my skin started doing that thing where it's hot, cold, and hurts to touch. Mixed in there was a little sneezing and runny nose, but not a lot.

Tuesday the 11th I felt all 'fluey' in the head for the morning, and I had a medical appointment, but decided to call them up and ask about their cold policy. They converted to a phone appointment, and I took a rapid antigen test and got the dreaded double lines.

Over the next few days I generally felt lethargy, hurting skin and muscles, and an apathy towards doing much else other than sleeping and watching TV. My sleep was some of the best quality I'd had in a while though. I'd sometimes not be hungry at all, sometimes be starving, but most of the food in my house felt too rich and sickening to contemplate - all I could stomach was bananas and custard, so that's what I've been eating: bananas, custard, coffee in the morning, and green tea. Plus medicated lemon drink for the symptoms.

Now I'm finding myself really hungry and ready to eat proper meals again, but every time I do something weird happens - I get shortness of breath. It feels like it's coming from the ""top"" of my system, close to the throat. I can breathe fine, but it feels like the very top of my respiratory system is struggling. Hard to really describe, but different to when you can't get your breath 'deeply.'

In addition to that, I start lightly coughing badly. The only thing I can eat that doesn't cause this is my bananas and custard, coffee, green tea, medicated lemon drink. Any 'real' meals I make cause issues, even ones that are super mild.

23,AskDocs,"Hi, everyone. I have had severe pain in my lower back since November last year, which increases when sitting or standing still for a long time, and decreases enough when I walk. Sometimes that region ""inflames"" so much that no position helps with pain, resting or not. I am interested if you can give me a general opinion about the MRI scan, but I would also like answers to some specific questions. For example, the orthopedists I went to, as well as the oncologists afterwards, believe that due to the location, the size of the hemangioma itself that cover the whole height of the L3 vertebra, it should undergo radiotherapy (if I understood them correctly, they suggested 20 treatments with a total of 40 Gy). On the other hand, the neurologist and neurosurgeon, who I also recently visited, said that the pain does not come from the region where the hemangioma was found, but rather lower, and that the pain is caused by visible degenerative changes in the joints in that part of the spine. They believe that this hemangioma should not be touched, but should be monitored over time, and that there should be no rush with radiation. If the vertebra doesn’t have to be irradiated immediately, is it likely that the hemangioma would still need to be treated in future to ensure that it doesn’t harm the vertebra and spine in general? On the other hand, I was told by the oncologist that if we don't reduce the hemangioma, the vertebra may break, and that as long as it is there, I shouldn't do any strenuous work, lift anything too heavy, put any big pressure on the spine, and keep away from anything other than walking and swimming. Which of the two opinions is correct?

Actually, now that I compare the two heels, the right one with the itch almost has a hard calloused layer on it that is what makes it hard to scratch. My left heel doesn’t have that.

29,AskDocs,"I made a post 5 days ago about my father's death.I had a good response but my post was long and i have some more specific questions and new information.

60M 6ft 17st white UK

Rheumatoid arthritis from 21
5 joint replacements
Slightly high blood pressure medicated
RA medication but was stopped when infection started
Low Albumin levels from about 6 months into the infection
Drinking fine up until 2 days before death
Not eating properly for 2 years.
Pulmonary embolism 1 year ago

My father died last monday. This followed 2 plus years of having an infection in a replacement knee joint and elbow joint. I have written issues stemming from the infection above. The infection was isolated to his replacement joints. He weighed 24st prior to the infection and 17st last time he was weighed around 4 months ago.I know his surgeon was concerned about his albumin levels and wanted them raised before surgery on both joints where he had the infection. He tried eating but he couldnt keep much down.He was put on shakes but they gave him diarreah.He ate what he could keep down which was very little.the last 2 days he was incoherent at times, he stopped eating and drinking entirely and his breathing was louder, he also had a pain that developed in his side that was new.He was still talking 10 minutes before he became unresponsive and it was quick and sudden where he just went to sleep. He was seen by a nurse and spoke to a doctor on the phone the day he died.It wasn't deemed an emergency.999 was phoned just before he was unresponsive and chest compressions were done but it was too late.

Given the information would my father have survived an operation to his knee and elbow?

Even if he did would it have solved everything?

When he had the infection and especially after the pulmonary embolism was it basically a terminal illness and a matter of time?

Would my father have been told or known himself this was basically terminal?
We thought he would have the operations and be ok and we thought he felt the same but looking at things now he may have known.

Would he have known the end was coming those last 2 days?he didn't push for 999 to be called and I hope he made peace with it and was calm and not scared.

I let my father down.I should have done more to help him.I would have taken out a loan to pay for private treatment straight away had I known this would happen.I miss him and just would like to know more about everything.",t2_8zb9snqz3,0,My father's death,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12o62zm,True,Odd_Ebb_7693,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12o62zm/my_fathers_death/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12o62zm/my_fathers_death/,475183,1681646193,0,,False,1681646207,1681646207,2023-04-16 11:56:33,,,

 posted about this before, but i didn’t manage to get any responses so i’ll ask about it again. basically, i’ve been having the flu since monday this week. my symptoms are manageable- a low grade fever for the first two days, a painful sore throat that is more or less gone, and now i have some phlegm, a stuffy nose and a bit of dry cough but that’s about it. yesterday, i woke up feeling extremely lethargic and lightheaded. throughout me being sick, i had not felt this dizzy. i could walk, but needed someone to hold me. i felt incredibly weak for some reason, even after napping and eating and whatnot i still felt very weak with a headache. i went to a doctor to get it checked out, and my vitals were fine and the doctor said that it was nothing to be worried about. today i woke up and felt slightly better but still very lethargic and weak, again like no matter how much i slept i was still very very tired. i also had more intense headache than yesterday, like a squeezing sensation around my head. the best way to describe how i feel is like i’m “out of my body”. i don’t know if this makes sense but it really does feel like that. i’m eating well, my sleeping habits are fine too. 

the only things i could think of that *may* be the reason for this would either be my bc pills (i’ve been on them for ~4 months now but i’ve never felt like this before on them), my period is supposedly coming next week, i’ve cut out coffee from my diet recently or also because this week i’ve hardly exercised at all and i’m usually an active person and exercise is my main source of energy. however, i’m doubtful these could contribute to how i’m feeling now because i truly feel quite terrible and really out of it, and i’ve really never felt like this before. it feels like i have a high fever despite me not even having a fever. could anyone tell me how i could feel better or why i’m feeling this way please? help would be much appreciated.",t2_58q28lruo,0,extreme lightheaded-ness despite recovering from flu?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12o602m,True,duwukiyo29,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12o602m/extreme_lightheadedness_despite_recovering_from/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12o602m/extreme_lightheadedness_despite_recovering_from/,475183,1681645984,0,,False,1681645996,1681645996,2023-04-16 11:53:04,,,

Primary complaint/duration:

I was wondering if I could get some advice on a small lesion on my leg. Full disclosure I have picked at this continuously out of habit.

However, I believe it has been there for at least a month and is definitely not the normal kind of healing that I expected to see - where it is still basically healing in stages when picked at. Instead it seemed to remain pretty much the same 'underneath' I also thought it uused to be perfectly circular and whenever I picked it - it was shiny with clear liquid.

I am very pale and have been on two sun holidays over the last year. So I am unsure on how to proceed as not sure if it is a bite that I haven't allowed to heal or potentially something more sinister.

Really just wondering if I should just make a point of not picking at it and waiting to see if it heals or get it checked up regardless of whether it heals in case any doctors think it looks suspicious anyway?

Thank you for your time.

54,AskDocs,"I am 25M, 5'6"" and 170 lbs. Since February 2022, I am experiencing symptoms which I find very difficult to explain. These symptoms don't bother me all the time. It comes in between most days. I mean 25-30% of time I experience it. (description of my symptoms in next paragraph)

I feel like air is passing very smoothly through nose when I breathe. It passes so smoothly that I feel like air is not passing enough through my nose and it makes me scared. It is not breathlessness. My another symptom is that I feel like I have to intentionally control my breathing pattern and that makes me anxious. Another symptom is that I become fearful and uncomfortable about walking on the street for a bit longer duration. Actually, I feel quite light on my feet and a bit out of balance. I feel like sh!t cuz I am quite less conscious while walking on streets and my first symptom starts to begin (which I mentioned in the first 4 lines of second paragraph). I become fearful. Main reason I don't go to farther distance. 

I believe these symptoms are connected to mucormycosis (not diagnosed, suspected). I don't know if these symptoms are serious or I am delusional.

56,AskDocs,"Spoiler: This happened a few days ago and I feel totally fine now. For this reason, I'm not going to go to my doctor however I'm curious as to what may have happened and if I can prevent it from happening again. 

I went to a restaurant with a large group of friends. From the moment we arrived, it was clear they were having a night as the place was packed and the front of house was completely overwhelmed. Even though we got there around 6, they had already cut the food menu in half and stopped serving mixed drinks all together. Never the less, we had a reservation. 

I had a diet coke and a burger with fries, and side salad. Prior to this, I had been eating/drinking normally the whole day and felt completely fine. In fact, I had even gone hiking that morning. Once I finished eating, however, I went from ""Maybe that was too much food"" to ""Oh no"" within two minutes. Within ten minutes of finishing the meal, I had gone to the bathroom three times and it was clear that I needed to go home. Unfortunately, my only options to get home were a) spending all of my money for the rest of the month on a 45 minute taxi ride or b) spending 60 minutes on public transportation. Note: We all had similar food (burgers) but none of my friends got sick, either that night or in the days following. 

Anyway I got on the subway and I was pale as a ghost except for my cheeks, which were red and hot. I was also sweating. This is not my first redo with tummy problems but *everything* about this incident was abnormal. First and foremost, whenever I get super nauseous, I have to chant in my head to not throw up. This time, I had the most intense nausea I have ever experienced in my entire life but absolutely zero urge to throw up. I felt so bad that I got off the train multiple times to puking in a trash can but I simply could not do it. Secondly, I can usually make myself feel better through distractions like music, social media, or talking to someone. Everything I tried on the train, even as passive as playing quiet music, just made me feel worse and I ended up sitting there in silence. Thirdly, I *do not* get motion sick and actually find the movement of the train to be very calming but this time, it just made everything worse and the only time I felt slightly less awful was when the train was stopped. Probably the weirdest thing, though, was that I had absolutely zero pain. It felt like there was a hurricane spinning in my stomach however it wasn't painful at all, just *extremely* uncomfortable. I felt so bad that, when I went to change trains at the central station, I seriously considered going up to one of the officers and being like ""I am too sick to get home and I don't know what to do.""

I did not do that and managed to get home, where I immediately got into position because I knew I would feel better if I threw up. Every other time in my life that I have thrown up, it has happened quickly, easily, and has been very liquidity. This time, however, I spend a solid five minutes yacking into my toilet so loudly that they could hear it on the ISS and I can only describe the texture as wet concrete. It was so violent that I was seeing white dots the entire time and had red spots around my eyes afterwards. Realistically, probably 50%-75% of the meal came up however I immediately felt like a demon had been exercised from me. After I cleaned myself up, I felt more or less 100%. I spent the rest of the night in bed, fully expecting to get sick again, but was totally fine. In fact, I was so energetic that I didn't fall asleep until around 3am. Even the next day, aside from a sore throat, kind of sore core muscles, and being tired, I felt totally fine and could eat normally. 

I am 25 years old and had genuinely never experienced anything like that before. What on earth do you think may have happened to me?

I have never had a period, ever. I was told technically i have been in menopause since i was 16. I cant take HRT because im at high risk of blood clots and when i did briefly take it made my depression worse so i was taken off it. I dont use anything hormonal wise and havent for 20 years. Tests were inconclusive and i was fed up of going through all the tests to be told ""we dont know whats wrong"" so i stopped those about 10 years ago.

My question is - i have horrendous migraines - sometimes i will be fine for a couple of weeks, then all of a sudden i will have a week where i get them everyday. Could it be linked to a ""period"" in that my hormones are doing something but just not creating the actual period part? I know it sounds stupid, but the migraines are awful and it occurred to me today after having one every day for the past week i realised there was a sort of pattern. I take over the counter pain meds, but try not to each time i have one, due to them being so frequent - so i limit it to the really awful ones, instead i try to sleep them off (when im not in work). I dont get an aura with them, i can be fine one minute and the next i get a migraine, nothing specific sets them off - hence the question. 

I have had MRIs in the past for this, but nothing came up, the Dr prescribed me meds but they dont help- beta blockers and i have a nasal spray which i use only on severe attacks.

67,AskDocs,"Doctors very unsure about a diagnosis

This has doctors completely unsure

I will preface this by saying we’ve had multiple surgeons and physicians try to treat what they are calling a relatively rare situation.

My partner got her foot caught between a drive way and gutter about 8 months ago. Not thinking much of it, continued to be active/run etc until over the last 5 months the pain inside her foot has become almost unbearable.

The initial diagnosis was a posterior tendon sprain - using an ultrasound. Laser and a few other courses of treatment were completed with no improvement for 2 months. 

Once there was no improvement. An MRI was completed and it was re diagnosed as a Long Plantur ligament sprain… again, everyone is only 60% convinced. 

Now, months later, again it looks as though there is no sprain (on second opinion) and the MRI suggests a calcified blood vessel next to the long plantur right down the middle of the foot.

My wife is currently in a moon boot, has done everything correctly (ICE, REST, Magnesium baths etc). 

There is absolutely nothing on the internet about this type of injury - but for 8 months with all the treatment it’s got progressively worse. Has anyone ever had any experience with this type of situation? Or heard of anything. 

Very happy to share the MRI.

79,AskDocs,"im a female living in las vegas nevada in case this will help at all.

i’ve recently spoken on reddit about my fear of rabies. it has just recently developed a few days ago after curiously reading something about it. i was put at ease with my fear at the time but now i’m thinking about it again.

i do have health anxiety, ocd, and other types of anxiety so all of this could sound crazy. i’ve had 2 panic attacks this week thinking about this fear and i don’t know what to do.

my dog is about 8 months overdue her rabies vaccine. i’ve never thought about her being a risk until i thought about how much my parents like to take her out to the desert behind my house and let her run free every now and then. the last time she’s been out there was earlier this week or last week i believe. i’m scared that she might have come into contact with an animal with rabies. the only wild animals i know live out there are coyotes. coyotes are apparently an animal that commonly carries rabies. she’s never shown any signs of being bitten by a coyote but she might have come into contact with one in other ways.

she isn’t acting too strange but she hasn’t been eating much and it worries me. what also worries me is that she play bites me a lot and licks my hands which usually have cuts in them due to my ocd hand washing. today she was barking in my face - which is normal for her - and a bit of her saliva may have gotten into my mouth which is disgusting as is but i know that’s another way rabies is transmitted.

i’m not sure what to do and i don’t know how to tell anyone because they’d think i’m crazy for even thinking about this. my anxiety has been through the roof and the thought that i might have been exposed to rabies is terrifying.

i’ve never seen my dog come into contact with any coyote or other “rabid” animal but i’m not entirely sure because i can’t always see her when she’s out.

i don’t feel any symptoms other than crippling anxiety but i’m really struggling because of this fear and would like some help if that’s possible.",t2_kzti9tud,0,fear of rabies - advice??,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12o2i0o,True,faerieqt,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12o2i0o/fear_of_rabies_advice/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12o2i0o/fear_of_rabies_advice/,475166,1681636997,0,,False,1681637013,1681637014,2023-04-16 09:23:17,,,

I have found myself feeling normal, drinking lot of water, but heart palpitations is making it weird for me(100 resting heartrate/125 when standing), have found that drinking more sodium removes the ""feeling"" of heart beating fast, even thought not reducing my heartrate.

So i drink about:
3-5g a sodium a day, 300mg of magnesium, 250mg of potassium chloride

Wonder if more potassium will help me? Have read ton of horror stories about potassium, but also realized that before starting this practice(just a few weeks ago) i could eat ton of potassium in one go without feeling any nefatives as for example:

Half a kilo of pistachios in half an our(I'm very fast eater) which contain around 5g of potassium


Several packs of potato chips


Ton of bananas etc and i could do it every other day


Would that mean, that if i were at risk at developing hyperkalemia i would develop one by now and I'm pretty much safe?

About half a hour ago, I got out of bed and went to brush my teeth, and saw that my mouth was kinda like covered in blood, and I spat out a bunch of blood out of my mouth. I've attached a photo before. But the thing is, I don't feel any other pain, difficulty swallowing food/drink, anything else, and this also has never happened to me. Are the two incidents linked? Should I go to the doctor immediately or see if it gets worse? Because I really don't have any other symptoms and feel fine otherwise. Any advice would be appreciated..

**Questions**

What’s the likely diagnosis? Is it worth making an appointment? I’m hesitant to schedule a follow-up since I already know I have internal hemorrhoids, and I know that’s a common cause of rectal bleeding. 

However, I did not have rectal bleeding when my colonoscopy was performed two years ago, so this is a new symptom, and I’m concerned about the duration and frequency of the problem. Is the most likely diagnosis hemorrhoids, or could it be IBD? Can IBD be missed on a colonoscopy?

Also I had a very hard time getting used to Zyban, will the transition back likely cause problems? The pharmacist is having trouble sourcing zyban and is likely inexperienced in generic versions since zyban is the only bupropion licenced here... I'd rather figure out how to work with these if it won't cause bother.

Also if you're still reading, a bonus question, unrelated but still requires your kind of expertise, which birth control pill is most similar to the implanon?

95,AskDocs,"Hello all,

First off I am a 24F who is adopted, I have met and talked with both my biological father side and biological mothers side about this, no one has it on either side. Mother is deceased since 2018 and biological father is in prison whom I decided to go no contact with after a year of talk with him for personal reasons. 

When I was younger I was diagnosed with Hemoglobin G Coushatta and told that if I ever needed a blood transfusion to tell them I have Hemoglobin G Coushatta. I've looked for years online and in books to find out what exactly Hemoglobin G Coushatta is. So far I have only found it is rare and only found in very few Native Americans and Asians (I'm 1/4 Sac and Fox from the Stroud area and 1/4 Creek Muskogee Tulsa Oklahoma area, no one from my family mother or fathers side has it). As well as apparently a tribe called the Alabama Coushatta Indian Tribe in Eastern Texas has 3 generations of it, mainly in bred with diabetes and glycerin problems, apparently more than other tribes. (I'm posting a link of a page of a research study done on them in the post). Otherwise I have gotten no where and any doctors or nurses or anyone has nevr heard of it before. I've hit dead end after dead end. If anyone knows what this is and can give me answers to what it is I have an what that means, or knows anyone who does, or even a clinic or research facility who understands/knows about this I'd appreciate the help with knowing exactly what having Hemoglobin G coushatta means for me. At this point I'd even be willing to be studied for this, as the more I know and can learn about this is good as well as hopefully if someone else down the line who has hemoglobin G coushatta and needs answers can get the answers they need from the research done on me. Because this has been tiring and a huge worry/burden for most of my life, so if I can help someone else so they don't have to deal with the tire and worry of the unknown like I have, I absolutely would and want to help ease that. Plus I've always had to know and learn whatever I can, especially when it comes to certain things, it doesn't help how curious I am (to the point I've gotten in some interesting circumstances just to know and learn more), so knowing and being able to learn about a subject such as hemoglobin G coushatta is definitely something that has always been a huge interest and mystert to me (having it just deepens my curiosity as it definitely sparked it).

Thank you with much love and appreciation.

102,AskDocs,"Hello, I am 33 AFAB/ NB. I have been diagnosed with a mild UTI, anxiety and depression. I take Effexor XR 75mg cap, Hydroxyzine 25mg pill, and Azithromycin 250mg pill (for whatever I had, I know I had a rough cough, that’s now slowly going away, with mild chest pressure), got two more days of them left. I formerly took Cephalexin 500mg cap but they have all been taken.

This has been going on and off (the whole UTI deal) for over a year, but the pain in my lower left side of my body (slightly to the right of my hip) has been hurting. It’s not too painful, it’s bearable, but it’s the constant reminder that it’s there that bothers me. I find a little bit of relief by laying down though. The pain only comes at night though? I’m not sure why. I just don’t know why the antibiotics aren’t really doing much to help.

I even discussed this issue with an ER doctor, that I’ve been taking antibiotics for this in the past and I’m worried that it won’t do much this time either. They said that they’ll do a culture and see if there’s a specific antibiotic that’ll help it. I never got a call back from them, though.

The biggest reason why I’m asking about this here is because I’m worried about it getting worse? I try not to mull on it too much, because I know anxiety can be deceiving a lot of time, but luckily I’ve reminded myself many times that unless a doctor confirms something, don’t stress over it. 🙃

Hi, I have recently developed many red bumps on the back of my right hand and the side of my right forearm. Initially it was only a few on my forearm but has spread and increased in the past few days. I have been moisturizing it multiple times a day but it doesn't seem to help. No known allergies, no unusual activities. They are sometimes itchy, but not incessantly so. Have generally been able to avoid itching them, except the occasional rub. What might they be, and how could I treat them? Appreciate the help.

Hello, bit of a weird question but I'm quite worried.

Ive noticed i have these lines that look like internal cracks on the middle two, but i believe they're craze lines.

I used to play a lot of sports as a kid up till about 16years old. I played 2 sports competitively and had 4-6h of training everyday. I also went running outside of school and training. After that I still played 1 sport regularly but not competitively. Currently, I walk a lot everyday for work, and cycle/run on my off days. 

Noticed that my knees would have a ""crack"" sound when I squat sometimes around 14/15yo and now it does that every time I squat. Now if i walk a lot in a day (15-20k steps), it takes a few days for my knees to stop hurting. I also noticed if I put my hand on my knee and bend it, i can feel a ""grinding"" like feeling.

So here is the list of my symptoms its little bit long but Im desperate in finding solution as ENTs didn’t help….
 
28.10 fullness in the ear and pain in the jaw - a large lump of cerumen in the ear / the doctor rinsed the ear, the complaints disappeared

25.12 severe cold throat / nose / blew my blocked nose to hard caused dizziness and ear pressure

From 3.1 onwards, the feeling of ""pressure"" in the ear, as if I need to equalize it every now and then

5.1 rinsing both ears again due to the appearance of small fungi in the ear

Towards the end of February a slight ringing in the ear appeared during sleep

5.3 when there are sounds in the environment, the eardrum ""flutter” 

10.04 the ear suddenly became half deaf (not that much) and was accompanied by a strong whistling in the ear, lasting between 5-10 seconds

On 14.4, after intense yawning, the eardrums pulsated for a few seconds

Everyday symptoms: 

- ""Ear pressure"" and the need for equalization
- Sensation of vacuum in the ear when performing Valsava
- Clicking in the ear when swallowing
- The sound of voice and breathing in ear
- Slight ringing in the ear (heard only when going to sleep during the day, not)
- When yawning, the left ear cannot be filled with air like the right, and it strongly whistles 
    - Valsava's maneuver does not work on the left ear, it manages to ""pop"" a little when I drink a lot of liquid, there is a ""wet"" sound and crackling.
- Crackling in the ear when opening the jaw
- occasionally itching in the ear and throat on left side
- Saliva in the throat during the day and slight accumulation of saliva in the mouth during the night

I went to 2 ENT specialist, used nasal sprays, allergy meds, Otovent balloon ( dont do it ).

Tests I done so far: 

- Tympanometry which came back normal which is weird because I have all Eustachian tube disfunction symptoms..
- Hearing test which came back normal ( even tho really high pitched noise in the end was little bit hard to hear on left ear but nothing to worry ) 
- 3Tesla brain MRI that came back normal

I am a 22 year old male.

For almost 3 years I've been dealing with Emotional Numbness and Sexual Dysfunction that began after an intense and chronic period of stress, depression, and anxiety.

My emotions are numb. I can't feel any emotions positive or negative. I can't feel adrenaline, arousal, anxiety, etc.

I no longer have a sex drive. My desire for sex is gone and I no longer feel sexual attraction or sexual thoughts. I used to have a super high sex drive. I also have erectile dysfunction and I have reduced sensitivity to my penis.

Other symptoms I have in addition to this are muscle tension, brain fog, and a suppressed appetite.

I've been seeing a Psychiatrist for the last 8 months. So far I've tried Wellbutrin, Rexulti, Trintellix, and Auvelity. All have failed to help so far.

131,AskDocs,"35F here, diagnosed with RA a year ago. After about six months on Methotrexate, my doctor switched me to Leflunomide. Three months after that and now I’ve been on Humira for approximately six weeks. 

I get labs done every time I see my rheumatologist, and the nurse always calls and says that “everything looks fine” with my blood work. But for my most recent one, I asked that my results be uploaded to the patient portal, and I saw that the interpretation of my AST and ALT said “Acute Hepatitis,” which is alarming. My AST, ALT, and Globulin levels have been steadily rising since the fall, and are all elevated to varying degrees (my last blood test was 2/24/23 and my ALT was 171, AST was 80, Globulin was 3.7, and my RDW-SD was low at 40.8). This is clearly not fine... and if it's the expected amount of damage, I'd rather they say that. I feel like I'm not able to make informed decisions about my health.

Adding to this, last year I developed iron deficiency anemia with extremely low ferritin - like 7 - that only got better after an iron infusion. Last night, out of the blue, I had a pretty significant nosebleed, and I’m wondering if anemia is a culprit in this unexplained bleeding and also a factor in the liver issues?

Hi all. I woke up yesterday morning with a mild stomach ache on the upper left hand side of my abdomen, around the bottom of my ribcage. It got a bit worse when I breathed in. I assumed it was a bit of gastritis as I’ve had that in the past - although it’s never hurt when I breathed in. Unfortunately I had an important event so I wasn’t able to pay it much attention and I went about my day, but I did notice it slowly becoming worse over the course of the day. Eating, drinking water and taking antacids have had no effect. 

I went to sleep but was awoken around 6am the next morning by the pain again, this time worse. It’s now a considerable ache that becomes a 5-6 out of 10 on the pain scale when I breathe in. It feels like a stabbing pain, and is quite concentrated in that upper left part of my abdomen. It’s starting to make me anxious that this could be something more serious than gastritis and Google is no doubt making me panic about it. So far I’ve had no nausea, vomiting and my stools are normal (well, I started taking Metformin a week ago and they’ve been generally upset since then, but nothing I’m particularly concerned about). I have no fever, haven’t had a cold or any other viral illness that I’m aware of. 

May be of note so I’ll add it in but I’ve started to get what I think may be a coldsore on my bottom lip last night as well. I’ve never had one before but I’ve heard that they can pop up when your immune system is a bit run down, so I’m not sure if it’s relevant but I’ll put it here just in case. 

I live in the UK and was wondering if it’s reasonable to call a doctor, or if I’m just blowing this out of proportion? Thanks in advance.",t2_7q6hh54y,0,Stabbing pain on left side when breathing in.

159,AskDocs,"Some background: About a month ago, I started experiencing periodic lower back pain mainly in my left side for a couple hours a few times a week to the point where I’d have to stop what I was doing, get a heating pad, and lay in bed. Nothing helped, I just had to let it pass. I had no idea what it was because I had no other symptoms for weeks. Eventually, I started having UTI symptoms, which made me concerned that I had a problem with my kidneys because of the back pain.

When I went to urgent care, the doctor completely dismissed my back pain saying it was completely unrelated to my kidneys/UTI pain. He also said there was no chance I had a UTI and that we’d reached a dead end, even though a couple days later my culture test came back positive for an infection.

Yesterday, I finished a 7-day antibiotic treatment (Ciprofloxacin) and definitely feel better than when I started (no back pain, no pain when peeing, and no full bladder feeling). However, I still have some minor symptoms, mainly discomfort/throbbing in my urethra area throughout the day, not necessarily when peeing. It’s honestly not that uncomfortable but I’m still concerned that I’m having symptoms even after my antibiotics. I’m also still slightly concerned that my back pain was never addressed… as long as there’s no more pain would that rule out kidney issues?

Any help or advice would be appreciated!!

Upon getting a stomach x-ray, my doctor suggested miralax daily, but didn’t have much else to offer. I don’t know how to interpret my x-rays, but does it seem like this is a more serious issue than she is making it out to be? And if so, what should I do?

182,AskDocs,"Down below I will post notes from my ENT and in the comments I will post photos that I just took. I have been dealing with extreme undiagnosed allergies/sinus problems or whatever it may be. Started with chronic ear problems with itchy, a lot of bright yellow squishy soft ear wax, ringing, wooing sounds. Then it went to my nose and throat now it’s to my eyes and head. I’m currently having so much pain and pressure behind my eyes causing horrible headaches and migraines. I can’t even wear makeup anymore because my eyes are in pain and watering more than half the day. Floaters/blurry vision at times. I am scheduled for hear/allergy/connection testing by they can’t get me in until June. I also have a CT of my sinuses scheduled but that can’t be until mid May due to my insurance. Ugh! Any advice on what this all can be in the mean time and what I can do for some relief?

Below is the notes from my ENT visit:

The following list includes any diagnoses that were discussed at your visit.
1. Hypertrophy of nasal turbinates
2. Bilateral tinnitus
• audiogram + tympanogram
• auditory brainstem response (abr) (PROC)
3. Chronic maxillary sinusitis
• CT, sinuses, w/o contrast
4. Impacted cerumen of bilateral ears
5. Conductive hearing loss, bilateral
6. Allergic rhinitis due to pollen
• allergy test, skin
• Nasacort 55 mcg nasal spray aerosol

Discussion Note
Patient is seen back in evaluation to her ears and sinuses. She reports sinus congestion, sore throat, cough and ringing in ears. She has been using zyrtec daily with no improvement. She has also tried flonase in the past with no improvement. As well as tropical and oral medications, and steroids. Physical exam reveals mild cerumen impaction in both ears which was removed with the use of surgical instruments, turbinate hypertrophy and tonsils absent. 
Nasal endoscopy reveals leftward deviated septum with obstruction posteriorly, turbinate hypertrophy and lateralized OMC's. Patient has a history and exam findings consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis with failed medical therapy. I have discussed underlying factors for chronic sinus disease including the role of allergy. In order to help elucidate a diagnosis as well as to evaluate the sinus anatomy I have recommended a CT scan of the sinuses  as well as allergy testing for further evaluation. I am also recommending that she obtain a baseline audiogram at her earliest convenience. I would like her to start a saline rinse followed by nasacort daily. She may continue on zyrtec daily.

184,AskDocs,"Hello! 24F here! Random time for this question but I was just thinking about my ankle(s) and figured I should figure out what I should do about it. My family isn’t big on hospitals so I need to come up with a plan and what types of doctor(s) to see myself and I’m clueless! 


At the time of injury I was around 16 close to 17. I was in color guard in a pretty competitive marching band. TLDR I sprained my ankle and marched the full outdoor and indoor season on it with no breaks or accommodations. I also had no accommodations for gym class or my inability to get to class on time due to being short so lots of sprinting no resting. Hurts even more now back in 2015. And it’s now both ankles. Also they click every step when I walk at least once a day. More frequent than before. 


Long version: This was the second day of away band camp. I did a turn move thing I can’t spell (pod-i-jaw?) and landed sideways on my right foot making me fall over. Typical color guard I’m told if it’s not bleeding you keep going. So I still did all the movements and running around on the uneven field as well as walking to all the buildings. At some point that week I fell on it again when someone was teasing me with vinegar and I misstepped into a ditch. We get to like the last day of band camp (so 5 days post injury) and someone finally actually looks at my ankle and are like “huh that’s swollen. We need to send you to the hospital.” My coach was pretty upset about this and pulled my cot out of the shade to make me learn some show work from the sidelines. 


So I get no rest on it since I’m not one of my coaches favorites. No help from parents since my mom is a pushover and when I complain I tend to be pretty deadpan until I’m at like an 8. It actually took me screaming at someone for no reason to get my ankle checked in the first place... X-rays and MRI had seen nothing anyway so most people assumed I was faking. I finished the brutal marching band season and continued to indoor color guard since I was a senior and didn’t want to miss my final year. But also since I was a senior I was put in the higher level competitive guard with longer brutal practices. Mid way through marching band I started wearing a brace on that ankle all day every day but coach didn’t like it since I couldn’t point my foot quite right so I had to take it off for shows and rehearsals. 


After the school year I did finally go to a foot doctor who said I walk on only the insides of my feet and gave me shoe inserts designed to my feet. They helped until about 1-2 years ago it hurt more to wear them than normal shoes. Mom said they are expensive and I’m not supposed to be due for new ones so I just don’t use them. I’m on her insurance and due to this and mental health I can’t work more than part time 15 hrs a week. 


Now as a 24 year old I have a really sedentary life style but even just walking up the stairs can put me out of action for a short while due to pain and I can’t walk long distances. Not even flat ground like a mall. My left ankle often hurts around the same amount since I overcompensated with it. What really frustrates me is I can only drive for about 20 mins before my ankle wants to start not being willing to push the pedals. 


I’m overweight and all doctors tell me walking and loosing weight will solve every problem I have. 10 mins on the treadmill at 2-2.5 mph and I’m out from activity for the rest of the day. 


I’m tired of the pain and it’s effect on my ability to work and socialize!

188,AskDocs,"27M, 5'11, 237lbs - No medical history, no allergies.

I'm seeing a gastroenterologist in two weeks, but hopefully someone can shed some light on what to expect. My first experience was about two weeks ago, a few hours after my second meal at night, I started experiencing this intense pressing pain below my rib cage. It soon followed up with me vomiting. I tried TUMs to see if that would work, but it did not help. It lasted for hours before I was able to sleep through it. I chalked it up as a one time thing, ""must've been something I ate"". Follow two days later, I experience the same sensation. It's extremely discomforting, and I'm getting worried at this point. I decide to only have one meal (lunch) and see if anything happens. Nothing happens, I feel fine, sleeping is normal, nothing out of the ordinary. A week goes by like this and I decide to try having a second meal again.

Tonight, i noticed an ingrown hair in that exact spot so pulled it out and out came a portion of one of the stitches... Now i'm concerned there's more in there somewhere. This fortunately was the most obnoxious spot (i.e. pimple forming WEEKLY and causing a bunch of redness), but there were two other spots a month and a half ago that formed.

I'm a side sleeper. It's been a couple years since this pain started but I've no idea what to do about it.

After a few minutes of lying on my side, I begin to feel a sharp, tingly, burning (!!very much!!) and numb sensation on every part of my body coming into contact with my bed, couch, anywhere I might be at the time.

Because of this, I cannot sleep for very long on my side. The pain becomes unbearable. I have to turn to lie on my back instead. On my back I don't have nearly as much pain. 

What is this? Is this a common thing? Does it have a (known?) cause? I cannot find anything on the internet about it; closest thing I've found is other people suffering from neuropathy in their feet having almost the same kind of sensation.

I saw a slide on a recent CT and Neuro explained that my anterior skull bone is closer to my spinal cord than my C1 looking at the sagittal view of new CT.  My ligaments are stable but a fender bender could cause a mortal injury or quadriplegia. Also have severe forumal stenosis all down the left side of my neck as well as a hyper intensity in my spinal cord near my brainstem and C1 on MRI.

I have several symptoms on my left side including the sensation of cold water running down my shoulder and complete numbness of entire arm if I look up for any duration.  

I will add a link to my other post. Thanks to everyone that responded on the other post and I will have new imaging to upload to DICOM this week when I pic up more discs. My neurosurgeon and several here on Reddit have said they’ve never seen anything like my deformity and subsequent deterioration of other areas of my cervical spine.

Hi all! My name’s Rachel (24 F) and I’ve been experiencing some pretty terrifying neurological symptoms and after 2 ER visits and a neurology appt, I was only given a possibility as to what’s going on and very limited testing done. My neurologist said I possibly have FND (based off the fact that I have mental illnesses, and hardly anything else). 

To preface, I have been struggling with a variety of issues for 2 years and got “diagnosed” with ME/CFS a couple months ago (prior to when all hell broke loose this week). 

Here is what i’m going through and if anyone out there has insight it would be greatly appreciated. : 

Saturday April 8th: 
After a few weeks of waxing and waning -numbness and tingling
-vision changes (severe tunnel vision and squiggly lines in top periphery)
-high heart rate
-severe dizziness
-heat intolerance
 - hot flashes 
- periods of cold intolerance
- tachycardia and palpitations 
- dizziness upon standing or bending 
- shortness of breath (presumably from high HR) 
- chest pain 
- Excessive sweating 
 - muscle pain &amp; spams (band like feeling around calf)
- joint pain
- sugar and carb intense cravings
- memory loss 

I started experiencing a loss of motor function accompanied by severe weakness. I felt an internal tremor and my body felt on the verge of catastrophe. I noticed a hair tied around my toe like sensation which drove me to the edge and I went to the ER. 

My brain CT was normal, I “passed” the neuro exam, however my WBC and protein was high and potassium low. They sent me home and told me to follow up with primary care. 

Sunday April 9th ~11pm 

The hair like sensation around my toe grew stronger and turned into total numbness. 
Things progressed quickly from here and within 30 minutes or less I could hardly move my legs, my perception of my surroundings were totally off-attempting to walk i would full on walk into the wall without warning. Dizziness/ vertigo, severe tremors, muscle rigidity, and numbness and tingling ensued. My boyfriend and I rushed to another hospital. In the waiting room I felt the paralysis feeling spread upwards and I had periods of convulsive shaking. 

There, the doctor attempted to do a spinal tap which was unsuccessful due to short length of catheter. My WBCs were still high. After a few hours I felt a slight regain of my control but since then I haven’t been stable and have episodes of intense pain, burning, numbness, and convulsive shaking. 
Last night the convulsions stopped me from breathing for what felt like eternity. 

I’m consistently shaking and unable to walk steadily, have frequency and urgency to urinate, difficulty swallowing, slurring, and the symptoms tend to get worse at night. I am extremely sensitive to temperature as well. 

All in all, my appointment with a neurologist on April 12th  left me extremely frustrated and discouraged as my symptoms only seem to progress. It felt like a lazy suggestion that I have FND without testing for other possibilities and she ultimately said that functional medicine would be my best bet. 

I scheduled another neuro appt on the 17th for another opinion and to push for further testing. I feel at a loss of what to ask for and how to best advocate for myself - any suggestions, insight, and help would be extremely valued and appreciated. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this - if I can clarify anything let me know. 

Wishing you all well! Stay safe and healthy.

Tuesday night my husband came home from work with bad back pain (aching, sore, lower mainly) and felt like he was warm. His temp was 100.2. This was around 6pm. He sweated like crazy all night.

Wednesday morning he woke up with a rash on his arms and stomach. It started simple, like someone who maybe used a soap they were allergic to. This was 8am. We went to urgent care. His fever was then 102.6. His rash had heavily spread. Arms, fingers, hands, legs, chest, back, butt. Urgent care ran COVID, mono and strep. All negative. Gave him Toradol. Brought the temp down to 100.5. Doctor said he wasn’t very concerned, if things worsened, go to ER. That night the rash on his legs went from overall red splotches to very bright red, almost hickey like spots. 

Friday morning he woke up and his feet were swollen and it was very painful to walk. He said they were very tingly. The rash was worse and now it was itchy. We went to the ER. They ran a CBC panel and did urine, everything came back normal. Temp was down to 98.8. Doctor said although the rash was “scary” to us it was not what she’d deem “scary” to a medical professional. Mentioned it turned white when pressed on, was all over and wasn’t near his mouth, genitals or nose. All “good signs”. She said he likely had a viral exanthem and we needed to wait it out. She said he was showing symptoms children usually do with viral exanthem in terms of the rash, but it wasn’t that concerning. She prescribed Hydroxyzine. He had been taking benedryl, but it wasn’t helping. Advil and Tylenol was also minimal help. 

Today, Saturday, rash has not changed. His legs have now purple almost broken blood vessel like spots all over. He said his feet were feeling okay this AM, but were painful and swollen by mid day. His fingers and hands are tingly too now. His fingers feel cold, not freezing but definitely not warm. He says he isn’t itchy anymore. Temp is still normal now, 98.8. 

I am really scared. Especially seeing the purple broken blood vessels on his legs. I’m worried whatever is happening will effect his skin long term. 

We have not introduced any new foods, detergents, lotions, etc. No recent working in our yard or near plants. No travel recently.

Hey, just wanted to see if I could get some answers regarding a potential injury I may have sustained. 

I’m a bit of a hypochondriac but have also never suffered a broken bone so I don’t know exactly what to expect. 

I was working out and dropped the weights weirdly crushing my middle finger on my left hand as I tried to set them down while tired. It hurt A LOT, and my finger is throbbing with pain. It’s very swollen and bruised, and hurts to move. It’s also numb. I can flex it and close my hand just fine and everything and have decent range of motion with it; albeit it is quite sore. It happened about 2 hours ago and is still very painful. 

I was wondering if it’s broken, or just hurt/bruised or something? Should I go to the ER? Should I take anything for the pain? Is there anything else I could do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   If necessary I can also send a picture via the chat system on this app, if required.

My six year old daughter has loose, sometimes urgent poops about once a month, sometimes a little more or less. It doesn't seem to follow any particular pattern. 
Sometimes she says her tummy hurts while it's happening but she's fine in between. For example, she had this happen three times today but didn't complain of any tummy issues all day except when she was on the toilet. 
My first thought is obviously food-related but she eats pretty much the same thing day to day... She's not an adventurous eater to put it mildly lol. But things like dairy, gluten, fructose... those are all part of her regular diet and most of the time she's fine and has normal BMs. I'm going to try a food diary but I'm not expecting anything shocking.
She is dealing with some anxiety and sees a counselor she really likes so I do wonder if her tummy troubles are somehow related but she didn't seem anxious at all today so I'm not sure. She's very afraid of medical/dental stuff so I'm reluctant to put her through a bunch of tests or appointments if it's not necessary but I don't want to leave it either.

Does this warrant making an appointment with the GP? Or is there anything else I should be doing?

26 US Male 216Lbs 5’10. Not on any medications. Have diagnosed General Anxiety, Asthma and most likely undiagnosed tmj and gerd. Went from heavy drinker to social drinker. Social smoker, Also recently(past two months) started exercising and eating better. No history or family history of any heart issues. 

——

My anxiety is hypochondriac and specifically towards heart attacks. 

——-
My lifestyle :

Recently around January my anxiety has started to creep back into my life, but this time along with it came heavier heart palpitations than in previous times of anxiety. Because of that I decided to get healthier eat better and stop drinking so much. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week have lost 10lbs , cut the drinking from 3-5 days a week to strictly only two days. But my palpitations are still persistent and if anything getting worse. And lost my health insurance half a year ago. My resting heart rate is always under 85 but usually rests around 75. And my %SpO2 is always 95+

Symptoms: 
Will have 1-2 palpitations At work (I’m a chef in a stressful kitchen) they feel like my heart skips a beat and takes my breath away. 
If I’m hungover (like today) I’ll have 3-5 and they feel “harder”. Will sometimes get a palpitations when I bend down, laugh to hard or gasp. 

Randomly will Get a sharp or dull pain in my sternum, and at the bottom of the left side of my chest. 

Chest will feel tight and “not right”. 

The question: Do i rush immediately to find health insurance or am I generally “okay” and can continue my search for health insurance at my current pace. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

TLDR: Exercise didn’t make my anxiety feel better and now I have heart palpitations.

The area on my side but right below chest hurts like a cramp sometimes if I crunch it a certain way, what organ is that first of all, and what could it be? I was just sitting and I leaned into it the wrong way and it seized up hard and very painfully and I just rubbed it and stood up and kept rubbing till it went away but it was scary...like a charlyhorse for my rib. Like if I didn't stand up and rub it in time it would've broken or something, the pain was steadily increasing. Makes me have to do ab exercises/strretches very carefully so I dont accidentally trigger it. If it happens during ab exercises I just lay there and rub till its gone.

235,AskDocs,"24M weighing 165lbs and height is 5’10”

I’ve recently had dry/ peeling skin all over my body. Usually when I get out of the shower or after a hitting the gym (I’m very sweaty lol) is when my dry skin is the most notable and my skin begins to peel when I touch/ rub on areas of the skin like my back, neck, and feet.

I had went to the doctor a few months ago a couple times because I was noticing foamy urine when peeing directly into bowl, but both times did not find protein in urine and kidney levels were good.

They did notice a vitamin D deficiency (not too surprised) and surprisingly a vitamin b-12 deficiency even tho I eat plenty of meat. (Maybe I have malabsorption?)

I’ve been very inconsistent with my vitamin prescriptions and stopped taking them for a while. I plan on going back on them because I feel that this is possibly related to it.

Any advice would be helpful and maybe any recommendations of any vitamins I should ask my doctor to test my levels on.

My entire life that I remember I will occasionally get what I believe is the onset of an aura migraine.  It starts as a fuzzy dot in the middle of my vision that looks like TV static.

It's the weekend so I'm turning to Reddit till my doc is available on Monday!

Today I noticed my roof of mouth felt dirty, the way your teeth feel like they've got a sweater on if you need to brush them. Took a peek at my throat and was surprised to find this.

Since the wintertime I have noticed an increase of phlegm. It's gotten worse but without other symptoms. Sometimes I'm having to spit out phlegm 10+ times a day.

I have an autoimmune disease (RA), other chronic health problems but RA seemed most potentially relevant. 3 months ago I had x-rays done for my RA, they ended up finding a small nodule in my upper right lung. It wasn't there in an unrelated x-ray I had 1 year prior. My docs weren't overly concerned but are keeping an eye on it, and coincidentally I'm about to be scheduling their recommended 3 month follow up x-ray.

Since I live with chronic pain, I can't say whether I've got any sort of fatigue, pain, or other symptoms related to this. I'm like that ALL the time. I also sometimes run low fevers during RA flares.

No coughing right now, not super sore throat. Which is what made me question the likelihood of it being strep. Today I stopped to tune into my body (when you live with chronic pain you get really good at living with pain &amp; not being aware of things) and it is a little sore. Not much and maybe it's from clearing my throat of phlegm.

As you'll see in the photos, I have a white tongue and roof of mouth, looks and feels extra hairy, some areas on my tongue look spotty, extremely red where my tonsils are (I think that's where tonsils are at least 😅). Some weird bumpy stuff near back of tongue, circled that. Roof of mouth has an area that looks more yellow than white. 

In the last pic it seems like the redness might be blotchy in the back but I don't look at my throat much so maybe that's not weird.

I am very prone to yeast infections (the glabrata category) but not in my throat. I've never experienced this, besides from occasional times I would get a red throat during a cold.

Let me know if there's any other questions I can answer. Any advice appreciated, I know the rules of the sub and am well aware you can't offer me true medical advice. That's ok! Though I do wanna keep an eye out for any potential sign that might warrant an urgent care visit.

Relevant info: I'm an adult, female, average build, take a few meds: mood stabilizers, ADHD meds, pain management.

Thank you!

I catch myself clenching my jaws or sucking air w my mouth closed (not sure how to describe it). It’s hard to focus sometimes, sometimes I get dizzy when standing up and have to sit back down. Sometimes it feels like there’s a choker tied too tight around my neck even though I’m not wearing any necklaces.  

I’m not sure if this is relevant, but on Easter I accidentally drank about 8 servings of black coffee (I usually never drink coffee, and didn’t understand there’s much more caffeine in much lower amounts than tea).  It left my heart pounding for 1-2 days, I couldn’t sleep and I was also constantly dehydrated then too.  Maybe this is some kind of leftover effect?

They ran some tests the other day to see if things had improved enough that they could put her under, and will be discussing the results on Tuesday. She does take a couple prescribed medications every day, including a steroid for her breathing. 

In the meantime, she is very worried because many of her results came back as some sort of “abnormal”. Really what we’d like to know is if these results could mean something minor, or if there is reason to be worried when she talks to her doctor on Tuesday.

I have asked this in Ask Dentists as well to get both views, but since my question is mainly about infection I hope that this post can fit in this subreddit as well. 

So... about two days ago I woke up with a pain in my tooth (front most molar). After looking in the mirror, I saw some little red dots and slight swelling next to my tooth on the gum that was hurting, so I touched it out of curiosity and it instantly popped with pus and blood. I immediately rinsed it with hydrogen peroxide and have been keeping it disinfected since. I have basically no pain (unless I press on the spot and then it feels a little sore) and there is no further drainage of pus or blood. I have no fever and no pain elsewhere, however today while I was chewing I heard a little noise in my TMJ joint and felt a little pain, and I have bad anxiety so I instantly thought to myself that the infection had spread to my jaw already. I had an appointment with my GP already in a week for just a check up and was going to mention it and get some antibiotics, but I am wondering if I should go to urgent care asap for them instead? 
Does the fact that I have zero swelling, pain, or fever mean that I should be okay probably for the week? I am going to see a dentist soon as well but wanted to at least get on antibiotics before seeing them to keep it from spreading. If theoretically it did spread to my jaw, would the pain be in my TMJ joint or close to where the abscess was?

I have seen multiple cardiologists and doctors who have cleared my heart and said it was okay. All the tests are normal.

Now my question: Did I have 5 PVC’s in a row? Because if I did that would be considered VT. But surely the hospital would have told me or done something if that was the case?

Is it possible that the nurses/doctors just missed it and didn’t see it?

Was this normal? The hospital told me nothing.

Last year I went to a neurologist for issues and ended up getting a lower back mri to check for nerve issues after the brain showed nothing really. I didn't go because I was having back pain. I'd had none at all prior to that point. 

They found a tiny amount of degenerative disc disease in my lower spine. Before that point, no back pain. After I got the results? I've now had pain varying in how much (usually a 1-3 daily with maybe higher on some days or weeks like right now) every single day.

It just seems so weird I'd suddenly start feeling the pain at the exact moment, more or less, that I found out there was some sort of issue with my lower back.

- weight: 105lbs/47.6kg (was 120lbs/54.4kg last summer)

- height 5’ 10.75” (6ft without scoliosis)

Health History: 
- Moderate s-curve scoliosis, negative marfan’s test, lactose intolerant, maternal grandma died from Multiple Sclerosis, Mom had possible sjorgens/hashimotos (she had dry eyes, mouth, hypothyroidism, &amp; thyroid nodules)
- No eating disorders, medications (beyond supplements), recreational drug use (not even coffee), only occasionally take ibuprofen/aspirin (and I don’t go over limit)


Last fall in August/September I had digestive issues leading to frequent bathroom trips, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea (but no throwing up) that made it hard to eat so I lost weight. Attributed it to stress (aka didn’t want to go to the doc and wanted it to resolve on it’s own) so didn’t get it checked out. Eventually went away enough but didn’t manage to fully regain weight.

Got the flu in December (my fault, have since been vaxxed for it), noticed symptoms of pharyngitis, excessive yellow mucus, and occasional blood. No pain or coughing (after flu cough went away still in December).

Noticed Raynaud’s phenomenon when it got cold this winter. New to me but found out brother’s get it also in the cold so could be genetic. Also get bier spots on outer extremities since forever.

Started having more issues beginning of this March. More diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue. Got a mildish uti end of last week (bladder spasms, urge to urinate, cleared up quickly). Saw mucus sometimes has blood in it (not from gingivitis) likely from pharyngitis? Decided to go to the doctor/NP.

NP ran blood tests, here they are: (I was dehydrated when they tested me, my fault, read that this would actually make my blood levels even lower then they appear)

https://imgur.com/a/9dByo8d

(she also ran celiac and gluten sensitivity tests but it came back negative)

Values I’m curious about:

- hematocrit, hemoglobin, and rbc went down, mch &amp; mchch went up, mcv was the same, and rdw went down
- bilirubin slightly elevated now (0.6-1.3) normal is supposed to only go up to 1.2
- tsh went down by half (1.520-0.830), I heard hyperthyroidism is 0.45 and below so not there yet (though was dehydrated for the test) heard this can also be a sign of autoimmune issues?
- Monocytes are at 13% (high? or still normal?) Heard it can suggest stuff like lupus and other things? Technically the actually number is “normal” though at 0.7? 

~The day after the appointment (so Wednesday basically) my stool started coming out at first pastel orange with possible blood? (blood might’ve been present beforehand too but could also be food leftovers like the cranberry juice or strawberries?) Later on Wednesday it came out super clay/pale colored and it’s still like that today on Saturday. Eating foods higher in fat seems to give me a mild headache/make me a little dizzy (still been doing it as I’ve been craving fatty foods). My gallbladder/liver region does seem a little sensitive though not sure if I’m doing it right. 

My heart rate also seems to be elevated a lot of the time (usually 90s-120s range, I wear a fitbit, also according to my fitbit (that I recently got back into wearing) my rhr has gone down by a few points on average, though I’m exercising less and weigh less than I was not more)

Not sure if it’s related but I get this small but noticeable pain that comes and goes beneath my ribs about 1-2 inches to the right of the middlish of my sternum.

Told to NP in the office again Monday to review my results and will make the next appointment from there.

Advice appreciated! (sorry for the book, heard it’s better to be thorough tho)

266,AskDocs,"I’ll try keep this short. I just wanted some opinions and thoughts from people (please keep in mind I’m a full blown hypochondriac (health anxiety) but, I actually am experiencing weight loss to quite a large degree. 

For clarity, I’m about 180cm, 30 years old and Male. 

For about 7 - 8 months I was quite a heavy drinker almost every night until I completely quit about 6 months ago and basically haven’t drank much since. 

I run my own business and it’s been very stressful in the last 3 - 4 months. I’m extremely stressed a lot and also suffer temporary depressive states. I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Diagnosed)  

My food intake for majority of days is definitely in the caloric deficit range. I would say I have no more than 1,500 - 2,000 calories a day and I don’t snack (though I do eat pretty badly sometimes) some days I barely eat or forget to eat enough. 

Since I run my own business from home. My lifestyle is fairly sedentary, though I do try and get out to exercise here and there – riding my bike, walking etc. But it really isn’t often. 

I had blood work done about 8 months ago which all came back essentially perfectly normal other than my cholesterol being a little high. I also had a Sigmoidoscopy done around the same time, as I had some digestive issues and they found nothing and I was actually told my descending colon was perfectly healthy and I was diagnosed with IBS. Which I’ve suspected of having for over a decade. 

I’m also a heavy Benzo user (Legally) 

Anyway. That’s basically the back story. I have no family history of cancer or anything. In the last year I’ve gone from around 99kg - 100kg morning weight. To now just under a year later to 93kg - 94kg average morning weight and it seems the weight keeps coming off, with basically no exercise. 

I understand a caloric deficit definitely causes weight loss, and I guess throwing stress into the mix doesn’t help. But, this much? I’ve heard if you lose more than 5% of your body weight in 6 - 12 months could signify an issue. 

Is this normal for the situation I described? I don’t feel sick and don’t get me wrong, I love looking more fit and slim due to the weight I’ve lost 😅

But it’s really concerning me to the point of even more stress and the scales are now my best friend. It seems I lose around 1kg a month as it currently stands. 

Should I go and get checked again? Could there be something wrong with me, or does this sound fairly normal for the situation I’ve described?

Would like to see if there’s anything I can take that will help out or what I can ask/tell my doctor. I have been able to manage my symptoms more so it’s not as bad as it used to be. The first time my symptoms occurred was December 2021, I had very little sleep the entire week and didn’t eat well that day. I went to my barber shop for a haircut and that’s when I started to feel a tingling sensation on my left hand and leg, I also felt like I wasn’t breathing well, mouth was dry, heart beating fast, and weak/fatigue. My barber noticed and said I was pale. After my haircut I ate and slept and felt better. Once this happened I started to pay attention to what it was I was feeling and when because it was happening often. After months I pinpointed what would trigger what. First I noticed that certain foods or if I missed a meal I would get bloated/inflammation on my stomach area which would cause shortness of breath until I belched (lol). I would take peptobismol for this. Second, My nose would get dry with cold air or it would happen randomly which affects my breathing as well. Third, if I don’t sleep well I would feel anxious and would notice my heart rate would be high until I took a nap or slept well. 
Sometimes symptoms 1 and 2 would happen at the same time and it was not fun at all. I figured out that breathing through my mouth would relax me and cause my heart rate to decrease as not being able to breath well triggered what I assume what it could be something like a panic attack or anxiety. 
I started to take ashwaganda before sleep with melatonin and this helped tremendously with my sleep. I also started to take black garlic supplement for inflammation and it also helped out a lot. I do at times get the symptoms but not as severe.

My anxiety is hypochondriac and specifically towards heart attacks.

My lifestyle :

Recently around January my anxiety has started to creep back into my life, but this time along with it came heavier heart palpitations than in previous times of anxiety. Because of that I decided to get healthier eat better and stop drinking so much. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week have lost 10lbs , cut the drinking from 3-5 days a week to strictly only two days. But my palpitations are still persistent and if anything getting worse. And lost my health insurance half a year ago. My resting heart rate is always under 85 but usually rests around 75. And my %SpO2 is always 95+

Symptoms: 
Will have 1-2 palpitations At work (I’m a chef in a stressful kitchen) they feel like my heart skips a beat and takes my breath away. 
If I’m hungover (like today) I’ll have 3-5 and they feel “harder”. Will sometimes get a palpitations when I bend down, laugh to hard or gasp. 

Randomly will Get a sharp or dull pain in my sternum, and at the bottom of the left side of my chest. 

Chest will feel tight and “not right”. 

The question: Do i rush immediately to find health insurance or am I generally “okay” and can continue my search for health insurance at my current pace. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

I’ve recently had dry/ peeling skin all over my body. Usually when I get out of the shower or after a hitting the gym (I’m very sweaty lol) is when my dry skin is the most notable and my skin begins to peel when I touch/ rub on areas of the skin like my back, neck, and feet.

I had went to the doctor a few months ago a couple times because I was noticing foamy urine when peeing directly into bowl, but both times did not find protein in urine and kidney levels were good.

They did notice a vitamin D deficiency (not too surprised) and surprisingly a vitamin b-12 deficiency even tho I eat plenty of meat. (Maybe I have malabsorption?)

I’ve been very inconsistent with my vitamin prescriptions and stopped taking them for a while. I plan on going back on them because I feel that this is possibly related to it.

Any advice would be helpful and maybe any recommendations of any vitamins I should ask my doctor to test my levels on.

For the past 7 years of my life I have been having this issue with my legs. I have no pictures of this because my skin doesn't change or anything.

It's extremely difficult to describe but I will try my best. My feet all the way to my legs get very cold and numb, but not really numb because I can still feel them. It feels very uncomfortable and sometimes they get stiff? It appears to be random each time and jt usually starts when I wake up and last untill I fall asleep that night. Or it starts I'm the middle of the day (not usually though). It's not really painful but I can say for sure because I might have gotten use to it.

So sometimes it starts at my feet and travels up slowly throughout the day until it reaches thigh or my knee, or it will stop at my calf.

I will give you a list of the ways this ""pain"" occurs:

Sometimes it will start at my thigh and travel down to my calf, it has never as far as I can remember started at my thigh and gone to feet (it only gets to my knee or calf in this sannario).

Sometimes it will only happen in my foot.

Sometimes it will start at my knee and go up my thigh as well and this is the rarest one

It happens in both my legs but not always at the same time. It can happen in both legs at the same time and in different spots ( as in one of the sannarios i listed above) or it can happen in only one leg. I'd also like to mention the pain only comes every few months. Sometimes I will get it for a weak straight, other times I'll get it once a week or every other week or once a month. (I haven't notice a pattern) 
When it happens I am never stressed out or upset I'm just cold. When my body gets cold it has a hard time getting warm and when I get cold is when it usually happens. It also happens when I get very hot (summer hot). My skin does not change color at all die to this and there is no swelling either.

I can describe this sensation or feeling as radiating. It's not really in a specific spot on my legs but it almost travels in a line but this figurative line is as big as my entire leg.
I've tried many different ways to ease the symptoms which includes: compression socks, heatpad, muscle massager and a plethora or medications. I have also been to many doctors and all they do is prescribe me medicine that doesn't work. 

All I want now is a diagnosis, not just treatment but what is causing this?

P.S. I think this is unrelated but my hands also get really cold and they will stay cold for days at a time. It's very difficult for them to get cold. One hand will be colder than the other too. My hands don't change color when this happens which is literally everyday (I'm not joking even when I drink something cold my hands get cold and stay cold) they just turn. White pale I guess?

P.P.S. 7 years ago I got hit by a car. I had a severe concussion that caused permanent (not severe) short term memory loss and several broken bones in my face and also a fractured/broken knee.

I get really bad pains in my legs that don’t go away for hours and sometimes it can last the whole day it went away for a few month I only had it on and off but not too bad but recently it started happening again and sometimes the pain gets so bad I physically can’t move because of how sore it is even if I move my leg a little it’s the worst pain I’ve ever felt it makes me feel sick sometimes too

Should I see a doctor? I feel stupid going because a lot of the time it’s probably just growing pains

One week ago, I went on a few kiddie rides with my kids and got stuck on a spinning one for about 5 minutes. Felt fine after, but about an hour later, I went to turn my head and ""cricked"" my neck. Ever since then, I've had extremely strange symptoms that I went to the ER twice for, only to be told it's ""panic attacks"", which I can assure you, it is not. 

Symptoms: high blood pressure, episodes of racing heart, up to 140. Very painful neck on the left side, new heart murmur, out of breath doing simple things like standing, dizziness, near fainting, nausea, tingling hands. Pressure just under my sternum, worse when pressing it. Also have hot ears, like the cartilage area. The worst parts are the heart racing and out of breath feelings. A lot seems to occur when moving. The worst episode came when I laughed really hard. Episodes last anywhere from 2-10 minutes.

At the ER, they did a CT scan of my head and neck and found nothing except ""vertebral artery slightly dominant"" which they said was normal. Also did lab work 3 days in a row, and my RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are all trending down and low, but not super low.. Also high neutrophils low lymphocytes, and high protime and INR. No evidence of heart attack, but they discovered a new heart murmur where there wasn't one before and poor R wave progression which they also said as normal given the rest of the normal labs.

30M, 6' 180, normal bloodwork with a touch high cholesterol, white, 1-2 drinks a week, nicotine use \~8mg a day via Zyn nicotine pouches, no smoking, no drugs.

Symptoms: Itchiness from neck down, none on head.  Most itchy on forearms and knees to shins.  Scabs that look like popped pimples on shins, potential staph from infected area.  Much worse at night to the point of difficulty sleeping, sweating in sleep.  Symptoms have existed for 4 months with the last month being much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Been to allergist, grid test inconclusive.  One visit to dermatologist and he thinks scabies.  Took 15mg Ivermectin a week ago, washed all sheets and clothes, shampooed carpet.  Took another 15mg Ivermectin a week later (yesterday).  No noticeable improvement. 1% Hydrocortisone cream all over body at night, mitigates itchiness.  Benadryl helps me sleep, citrazine doesn't seem to do much.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything seems to look and feel like scabies other than the fact that medication isn't helping and no one I know, including an ex, have shown symptoms.  It doesn't look like anyone in my family (who I live with) or my ex have contracted it from me.

Anyone know what it could be, could it still be scabies?  Should I try doing something different?

316,AskDocs,"24M weighing 165lbs and height is 5’10”

I’ve recently had dry/ peeling skin all over my body. Usually when I get out of the shower or after a hitting the gym (I’m very sweaty lol) is when my dry skin is the most notable and my skin begins to peel when I touch/ rub on areas of the skin like my back, neck, and feet.

I had went to the doctor a few months ago a couple times because I was noticing foamy urine when peeing directly into bowl, but both times did not find protein in urine and kidney levels were good.

They did notice a vitamin D deficiency (not too surprised) and surprisingly a vitamin b-12 deficiency even tho I eat plenty of meat. (Maybe I have malabsorption?)

I’ve been very inconsistent with my vitamin prescriptions and stopped taking them for a while. I plan on going back on them because I feel that this is possibly related to it.

Any advice would be helpful and maybe any recommendations of any vitamins I should ask my doctor to test my levels on.

When it occurs, I’ll get stomach pains, might have some nausea, sometimes can get cold sweats. At times it is so quick and violent that I can barely make it across the street to find a restroom in a shopping center.

It obviously significantly restricts my life. Recently I thought I had figured it out-among some of the restaurants I have had the reaction to, soybean oil seems to be a commonality. But some places that I react to don’t seem to use soybean oil.

324,AskDocs,"Hello. I had an episode of anemia (I have iron deficiency anemia) about 6 weeks ago that required a blood and an iron transfusion. I was feeling tired, dizzy, short of breath etc. 

My numbers are back up and the symptoms remain so I was sent to have my heart checked. I had full blood work (a couple checking for heart inflammation or fluid), chest ct, chest X-ray, ekg, echocardiogram and heart mri. Everything came back normal except the echo:

Left ventricle is normal is size with mild global hypokenisis. Ejection fraction 45-50%. 
Right ventricle is normal in size with mildly reduced function. 
Normal atrial size. 
Atrial septum is aneurysmal. Bubble study is positive for atrial shunt. 

Cardiologist called me that afternoon and said everything is fine but my heart isn’t pumping as hard as it should. Put me on 12.5 mg metropolol once a day. Said because my pulse (around 60) and bp (90/60) run so low, a higher dose or any other medications are not safe to try. I’ve been taking this with no relief in my symptoms, I can’t even work. 

My friend who is a cardiac nurse said I need a second opinion on that aneurysm. Said it could be causing my symptoms and causing my ejection fraction to be low. And also increases my risk for a stroke. I’m only 40, no risk factors for heart disease. 

I did schedule for a second opinion with a more reputable doctor but that’s several weeks away still. Anything I can do in the meantime to help my shortness of breath? Am I in any danger waiting? I did go to the er before all this testing and they told me there was nothing they can do.

Some Background: I am super ADHD and was prescribed adderall IR in sixth grade at 90 mg per day (30 mg pill 3x daily). I stayed on this dose throughout high school &amp; college. However, I developed severe anorexia at 17 &amp; was hospitalized for it. This is when i developed binge eating disorder/bulimia. Around this time at 17 I started using my adderall (and my moms adderall that she gave me which was 30 mg ER) to deter me from eating. And being that I had been on a high dose so many years, I had built up a tolerance to the 90 mg a day. I would take anywhere from 150-over 200 mg a day during this time. Many days I would take TWO ER 30 mg capsule IN ADDITION to 3-4 of my IR 30 mg pills. Due to the eating disorder I was struggling with, I was also abusing stimulant laxatives as well. The stimulant abuse (both the adderall and the stimulant laxatives) lasted from about 17-21 years old. I stopped both completely at 22. 
I didn’t even realize I was abusing my medication at the time. I’m now 25 and a nurse. I take only 30 mg of my prescribed adderall per day and have a much healthier relationship with food. 
I have horrible anxiety issues so I can’t stop thinking about how this amphetamine abuse is going to impact my lifespan and how it damaged my heart. If anyone has any knowledge on the effect of this stimulant abuse on my lifespan I would appreciate it so much!!!

333,AskDocs,"I am a 23 year old male and constantly have penis skin (mostly the head) irritation, redness, and pain. This has been going on for around 6-7 years now. I wake up in the morning and my penile skin almost looks normal, but by the end of the day, there is always redness and wrinkles proportional to how much movement I had and how soft my pants are. I grew up with eczema, so for a long time that's what I thought it was, but now I'm very sure that is not what it is. I have tried by best to make efforts to fix this problem lately. I changed my laundry detergent to sensitive skin, bought new underwear, I have worn sweatpants/soft materials every day for the last 5 months, and use a thick petroleum based ointment for protection nearly every day. This is the only way to ensure comfort. Yet even after these efforts, after one day of non-ideal conditions, it goes back to red, irritated, and painful.

Obviously the solution of thick ointment is not practical at all for having a sex life. I can't have my penis covered in greasy ointment and have any kind of sexual activity for days after (because its still on there). The protective effects of the ointment typically take multiple days to go away fully. Even when I do wait several days for my skin to have nothing on it, my positive sensations are almost always minimal. I can remember exactly one time in recent memory where oral sex actually felt good. Most of the time I don't feel much. After that one experience, I can only image that is what most people experience every time.

I really don't know what to do about this. I think the onset back in the day was from excessive/rough masturbation, but I don't see why it wouldn't have healed by now unless something else is wrong. I have talked to my primary care doctor who was absolutely no help, a dermatologist who told me to see a urologist and a urologist who told me to see a dermatologist.

last sunday i gave head to a guy, i didn’t want to at first and i was severely intoxicated but he did cum in my mouth- i’m in college and he lives in my dorm. last time i have was 4 months ago. the next morning i realized how stupid i was because i know nothing about him. (i’m a girl), this morning i woke up from an itch in my throat and coughing. now i see this and i’m freaking out, i don’t have any other “symptoms” of anything but i’m about to cry.

341,AskDocs,"I’m an otherwise healthy, active 73 year old Caucasian female, 5’2”, 128 lbs. Loss of energy and stamina have been an issue but I assumed it was my age. 

Recently I had a CT on my chest area, searching for the cause of years of sharp, burning pain under the tip of my right shoulder blade. The report came back with nothing significant re the scapula, but… a full page about my lungs. 

I didn’t see this coming:  

The report reads “Impression:  Diffuse airway thickening and mild bronchiectastis most prominent in the right middle lobe and lingula with multi focal mucus plugging, tree-in-bud opacities and areas of nodularity.    Multi focal areas of mild bronchiectasis most prominent in the right middle lobe and lingula. Findings are most consistent with no tuberculous mycobacterial infection.  More focal modular areas in the right upper lobe and possible area of cavitation is favored to reflect nontuberculous mycobacterial infection although an underlying lesion could have this appearance. Recommend pulmonary consult and short-term follow-up to ensure stability or improvement after treatment. “.  There’s also mention of a “… mildly prominent du carinal lymph node” while others seem fine. 

My google search of all these terms has me concerned. Can anyone tell me what to expect?  I know it’s not good, but how bad is it?  I’m now waiting for my appt with a pulmonologist. 

Sincere thanks for any help.  Seriously.

I put on thick cloth and leather gloves, picked up the bunny, and put it back in its nest while I called wildlife rehabbers. I definitely touched the bunny’s blood and maybe its saliva with my gloved hands. I did not get bitten.

I'm not sure if the following could be a cause or a reason, but it's the only thing relating to my ears that I could guess might be related.  
I went to a concert 2 days ago (from 8PM to 11PM) and was standing right by the speakers. I got home at 2AM and went to sleep, got up at 6AM to go to school. I felt completely fine. I wear these cheap uncomfortable headphones at school practically all day everyday (outside of weekends). The headphones kind of push on both of my ears (plus I wear glasses) and they do hurt a little bit usually afterwards. Around 12PM, specifically my right ear feels like? disconnected? in a way. I can hear completely fine, and I can still feel some touch and pain (like if I were to pinch my left earlobe vs my right earlobe it barely doesnt hurt). It has felt like this since 12PM (posting at 8PM the next day, so its been about 32 hours).  
In the post rules I have to disclose extra info, so for the record I don't drink, smoke, use drugs (besides the ones prescribed which are Acetazolamide/Diamox and Mesalamine/Canasa). Not comfortable disclosing any other information right now, but if it is important to help determine emergencies I can.  
My mom doesn't think this is an immediate concern, and I'm not sure what to think, due to my past with other illnesses.

349,AskDocs,"This question is on behalf of my Mom (68, white,  200lb and 5'6""). She does have a doctor and generally gets good and prompt care, but I'm still feeling anxious about her health.

She has a history of high cholesterol. She has been taking pravastatin for many years. She also takes prescribed vitamin D, and over the counter magnesium. She also has been taking Xarelto for blood clots for about 7 months (with some pause in-between as prescribed by doctor).

 In February her aches/pains in her legs, feet and shoulder have been really painful and impaired mobility. Her doctor prescribed prednisone. I think she was taking 20mg before she could see a rheumatologist. The prednisone seems to have helped a lot with pain and mobility, but then 3-4 weeks in, she had a heart rate of 200 and had to go to the ER where she was prescribed metropolol. She has been taking that for a month and it seems to have been helping, but 2 days ago she had to go to the ER for BP 185/110 (I think). She had a bad headache and blood vessel in her eye burst. She was prescribed lisinopril. She seems better now, but still has higher BP than usual.

She is tapering off prednisone (-2.5mg a week) and is down to 7.5mg, but now those pains are back and she wakes up at night from the pain and applies some cortisone cream (declofenac?).

The doctor thought she had polymyalgia rheumatica, but I think the rheumatologist did not confirm the diagnosis. I need to check those notes. My assumption is that the prednisone led to the heart and BP problems, and I wonder (1) will going off prednisone as she's doing now fix things and (2) what can be done about those pains? If prednisone is the only thing that helps, can she take prednisone and those new medications for heart and BP in a sustainable way?

Thank you!

Other thing: Just over a year ago, due to external events that lead to anxiety and depression, I suggested my mom take escitaloprám and with her doctor's approval she started taking 10mg. In March of this year I encouraged her to taper off (with doctor's approval) and within weeks she was off and her mental health seems fine. However her tapering off coincided with the ER visit for tachycardia and then a month later ER for hypertension.

353,AskDocs,"My son is 5 months old and he was born with an extra ""finger"" on one hand. I believe it's referred to as a nubbin, there seems to be no bone or muscle structure. Just a round ball with what looks like a tiny fingernail in the center, it is attached to the outside of his pinky finger between the second and third joint. The connection is a cm or two of rough looking skin, semi transparent with a visible, thick blood vessel running through it. I could be more descriptive if necessary but that's pretty much it. 

It doesn't seem to cause him problems (yet) but it does seem like it is growing in size proportional to the rest of his hand. I also feel the need to say that if it was an option, I'd be all for letting the little guy keep his nubbin and remove it later if he wishes. But I can see it getting caught on playground equipment etc and ripped off and that would be traumatic for all involved.

Anyway, I guess my question is... what do I do? We're in a fairly small town in the Great White North and the hospital seemed unfamiliar with exactly how to proceed. We were told the family doctor would ""band it off"" but I managed to get a plastic surgery referral in a big city. But they only do appointments when there's ""enough demand"" so apparently we might be waiting a couple years? And the office isn't returning my calls.  Seems off to me but that's OHIP for you. And my family doctor has no clue what to do and says she'll try to remember to ask the hospital... the same hospital that said she would deal with it. I don't really know who to call or what to do? My biggest worry is that it's going to get ripped off or something when he goes to daycare so I want to get something figured out soon.

355,AskDocs,"Applicable information- 29F in Colorado, about 5'9"" 135lbs, recently I had cold/allergy symptoms a week prior to all of this, outside that I have no medical issues or recent life event that would lead to this or affect the medication I'm taking/considering taking.

As the title states, I'm pretty sure I have an inner (or middle) ear infection, based on the fact I've had one a few years back and the symptoms are almost identical, except for one key aspect - I went into a doctor's office and got it checked out the second day of symptoms and was able to get antibiotics and clear it up in no time. 
This go around, I've called all over and aside from an ER visit, or a visit to the urgent care for over $200 (with insurance) I'm stuck waiting a week and a half from now (it's already been 6 days of symptoms) for a doctor to even see me about it.


I don't intend to not go to the appointment, even after it passes I'd still like to make sure I'm actually good to go with no other issue, but I'm the meantime I've been taking mostly ibuprofen and acetaminophen (usually interchanging if/when I have a headache/fever and dosing so I'm nowhere near the limit on either), but recently found a solution at Walmart in some ear ache drops.


Ear ache drops - ingredients : Belladonna, Calcarea Carbonica, Chamomilla, Lycopodium, Pulsatilla, and Sulphur (to my understanding it's a very homeopathic solution, which personally I prefer anyway), and my only known allergy is Sulpha (unrelated to Sulphur to my understanding)


My question is, should I use the drops? It says to ask a doctor, but when I called my doctor that I have an appointment with, they said they couldn't confirm if it would be safe or not because they hadn't diagnosed if it is or isn't an inner ear infection. So, given all the things it says it does (helps reduce pressure, relieves pain and itching, stops throbbing, etc) and the fact that's basically been my life for almost a week now, can I use them as directed on the box? Is it going to potentially make the infection worse?

I woke up with some pretty bad cramping in my lower abdomen, along with sharp pain in my left pelvic area, and it hurts to try and poop. I’m an ultrasound tech who has PCOS so my first 2 thoughts were angry or ruptured ovarian cyst or some constipation.

I went into urgent care, they pressed on my abdomen, pressed on my pelvic area, heard bowel sounds, all that. I went into the bathroom to pee for a pregnancy test and when I wiped there was a whole bunch of blood that just started. Told them that, and they did an X-ray and didn’t see anything so diagnosed a ruptured ovarian cyst, then prescribed hydrocodone.

368,AskDocs,"I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male, 5'9, 220lb computer science student with pretty bad posture and I'm at a desk for a while every day. I've been smoking medical marijuana for about 4 months now and have never smoked before that. For clarity, my symptoms aren't excruciating but they are noticeable and mildly uncomfortable, and I just want to be sure I don't have a brain tumor because it's my biggest fear and I'm paranoid about it.

A few weeks ago I started physical therapy for my right shoulder and arm, when I first started the first day I had a difference in grip strength of 40lbs in my right (supposed to be dominant arm). I've noticed numbness in my right arm and fingers, and tingling and burning in that arm since we've started working on it, which I assumed as normal. They said I have a c6/c7 impinged nerve I think? The physical therapists don't seem worried which could mean this is a common problem and I'm overthinking it.

Today though, my right eye feels quite weird, almost like there is a bit of pressure behind it, and it seems to be tearing very slightly. Along with that, around the outside of my right ear had pain that felt burny and tender. Along with that, I had a sharp but not super painful sensation in the top right of my head. Why are all these sensations happening on the right side of my body? And if I had a brain tumor, would my symptoms be more severe then they are now?

2 years ago I noticed some dull muscle-like pain / soreness in my right chest. It is consistent with physical labor involving fast movement or carrying heavy weight. The soreness is most prominent when I exhale. I figured eventually it would stop as my body and muscles got used to the kind of work I did. After 2 years I still experience the dull pain. It doesn’t feel progressively worse though. 

I ended up switching jobs to do less physically demanding work, and haven’t noticed it for a while until I had to help move furniture and boxes recently.

Never in my life thought I would be asking this because even hearing about pro matches makes me sick but some of the people I follow have been preparing for creator clash a charity match and they’re all saying how the have fallen in love with boxing and how it’s really powerful to learn to take a hit and learn how to fight as a woman.

I’ve always been someone who enjoys working out much more when it’s for a sport (used to do gymnastics etc). 
However I have a history of numerous concussions (so many I have forgotten) in the past 7 years if I had to guess I’ve had at least 5, and all from dumb stuff, not even gymnastics just bumping my head getting out of the car or off a door etc. 
I’m also worried about it being super painful and unsafe to my endometriosis which at this point has been confirmed to be on my lungs, my bowel, my peritonium and is estimated to be on my stomach and the rest of the organs in my torso and potentially my heart. This causes lots of issues; lung collapses due to it on my lungs, even light palpations to my pelvic have caused endometriomas to burst, if I work myself out too hard it has caused my adhesions to tear and has caused a ton of pain and some internal bleeding or fluid. 

That being said with getting blows to the head and torso would it be safe for me to try boxing?

Had only protected sex a while ago and I am pretty sure there was no skin contact, but you never know. (I am careful with this)

Altough i have a small lession on my penis since 3 weeks. 
Max 2mm, painless, doesnt grow.
Clear of all bacterial std’s incl syphilis

Is this a wart, or any other skin mark?
(I can only go to a dermatologist in 4 months…)

See picture and some with macro zoom.
The lession itself is very small.

Had only protected sex a while ago and I am pretty sure there was no skin contact, but you never know. (I am careful with this)

Altough i have a small lession on my penis since 3 weeks. 
Max 2mm, painless, doesnt grow.
Clear of all bacterial std’s incl syphilis

Is this a wart, or any other skin mark?
(I can only go to a dermatologist in 4 months…)

See picture and some with macro zoom.
The lession itself is very small.

I tried to apply ACV, doesnt turn white.

It is not horizontal, but vertical along the vertical length of the sternum. She says it is not moveable, but feels softer than bone. It wasn't sore last night when she found it, but says that after rubbing it/feeling it yesterday, now it feels sore.

It doesn't hurt more when she breathes.

I was going to go to the doctor but I didn't because it went away for a few days and now I got a new job and won't have insurance for a while.

The POTS was causing me to have a lot of chest pain and dizziness, so I just said give me whatever medication you think will make me feel better, and he thought Metoprolol was the best route. I also have had anxiety and depression for a few years now and I figured it’s probably time I start an SSRI because my anxiety has been really bad recently. I’m an avid stoner and on occasion I’ll have a few drinks socially, but after doing my research on the meds I don’t know if doing either of those are safe while taking these meds. I don’t want to hurt myself, and I’ve heard multiple different opinions so I’d thought I’d ask some actual doctors on here because I didn’t think to ask my doctor at the time of the appointment.

A friend of mine has this ""mole"" in her neck and she's worried because when she was little, she used to spend too much time working under the sun, and she tells me that it has been growing over the years.

It has some redness around it (I don't think you can see it in the pictures) and neither of us can afford a visit to the dermatologist.

On the 2nd visit, the 9th they ordered a CBC and CT scan both which came back normal. They told me to go see a neurologist. I just went to see the neurologist on Thursday 4/13. The normal questions about anything new in my life, possible triggers, and all of that. He told me he wasn't sure, ordered sumatriptan as a preventive. He also ordered a MRI which I will be doing sometime early this upcoming week. 

Now, I completely forgot about my diagnosis of periodontitis late in March. I received my last treatment for it on 4/1. They told me it was very early in the disease and I wouldn't be able to reverse the limited damage but I could probably reverse the disease with regular visits for a couple years.

I am freaking out that maybe the gum infection spread? My neurologist said he wasn't worried about an infection since my blood test was normal, no fever, and CT looked okay. The severe headache, vomiting, and nausea has only happened 3 times (4/4,4/9,4/14) like an episode. I do have a lingering headache most days but it's like a 2/10 on the pain scale.

Would it be possible for me to have an infection with no presenting symptoms besides the headache and vomiting? Should I be freaking out and go to the hospital immediately? I am at a loss what to do. Please some advice would be much appreciated. If you need anymore details, I'll provide them quickly. Thank you again

Hi. I am asking about something that happened 3 years ago. I didn't know Reddit then!! Even though it happened such a while ago, and hasn't happened since, I have been wondering what it could have been, and whether I should have had more tests then, and in fact if I should have some tests relating to this now, or whether it was indeed something benign.



So one evening out of nowhere, I started experiencing a skipped beat, which I have experienced occasionally in the past &amp; know they are normal, except this time it wasn't 'occasionally', it kept happening, a bit like a hiccup - I had about 3-4 ectopic beats a minute and it just went on and on.



This had never happened me before, so I googled it but couldn't find any answers. After about an hour or so of this continuous skipped beats I rang the local urgent doc phone line. I talked to a nurse who said I should go to emergency which I did. Once there they did a one-minute EKG said there could see it (I think it was PVC, not sure) and nothing to worry about and sent me back home.



It was still going on 3 days later so went to my GP, who sent me to the hospital. But again I had to go through A&amp;E and they didn't do any tests.


I don't think anybody understood the issue I was worried about was that the ectopic beats kept happening, on and on, that there were so many of them, it was continuous.


It went on for about 10 days, then tappered off and hasn't come back since.
I wasn't under any stress at the time, wasn't drinking coffee, none of the 'usual suspects'. The only thing that had changed is that I had started drinking 1 to 2 litres of water a day extra. Could this be the cause?



So like I have said, it has not happened again, so I am posting this out of curiosity, and obviously it's still on my mind as I don't know why it happened: could it have been bc of the extra drinking of water? 
Should I have had more tests done at the time, like a holster monitor, to record how many of these ectopic beats were happening? Would some tests now be helpful?

Male, 36 years old, 1.73M, 73KG (5ft 8in, 161lbs)  
I have had itching over my body now for the last 3 months. Itching is focused primarily on the legs, arms, backs, stomach and chest. No itching on soles on the feet, hands, face nor scalp (scalp did itch for the first month)

There is no rash and the Dermotologist has given me steroids, antihistamines and antiinflamatorios without any success in reducing the itch sensation.

Urine became darker over the last week and blood work came back with bilirubin at 4.5, globulins at 1.8 with A/G ratio of 2.38. ALT and AST high but within the range of normal.

White blood cell and red blood cell counts normal.

Ultrasound came back with no obstructions nor malformations in the kidneys, liver, pancreas, gallbladder nor bile ducts.

Waiting for hep results.

History of moderate drinking with a reduction to light drinking of alcohol over the last 2 years. Light smoker stopped completely in Nov of 2020.

My husband had a disc reply in 2018 on on c6-c7 vertebrae. Everything went well and most of his numbness and pain associated with his bad disc was alleviated.

In 2020, symptoms started returning. It started with some pain and numbness. We had mris and ct scans. We also did some nerve conductivity tests to rule out any type of tunnel syndrome. We went to a rheumatologist by his recommendation too. After all was said and done, he said that he didn’t have a clear answer. It looked like he was developing bone spurs and he would have never done a disc replacement. We had no options, and he had to live with it.

In 2022, his symptoms worsened. He now was have spasms. He lost strength in is left hand. He would also occasionally get tremors. This has been traumatic for us, because my husband is a musician. He has lost his ability to play guitar. 

The new doctor ordered a new set of tests, but the diagnosis became more clear. He still has functioning nerves, but bone spurs have grown considerably since surgery leading to all the symptoms he has been having. Again, this surgeon didn’t seem to keen on just going in and removing the bone spurs. We’ve been told that there is no guarantee it would help. 

Is it an insurance issue? Will it potentially make him worse? I’m at a loss because if there is even a chance at him getting some function (and his career) back, we want to try it. I just don’t know if we are going down the right path.

I have a fair amount of body hair around my tailbone where the cyst formed and do sit down a lot when doing school work and playing games... My posture while sitting is probably also partially responsible for it. 

It bleeds fairly often. I've been informed that I can treat it at home for the most part, but a lot of the information is up in the air as to whether it works or not...

Apparently only a surgery would be able to fix it at this point, although I am not entirely sure about this. I cannot afford to get it treated at the moment as we have financial issues at home, but I will be keeping it clean and removing hair around the vicinity of the cyst.

This started about a month and a half ago. It started with a faint weird tingling/numbness in my heels which I chalked up to plantar fasciitis or something similar. However I soon became to experience an intense tingling in both feet and up both legs, and in my hands and forearms. I now wake up almost every morning with both hands entirely numb (they wake up after a few seconds of moving them around but still vaguely achy for a while after I get up) and they tingle and burn throughout the day.

I also have sometimes faint, sometimes intense parasthesias on my scalp. It's hard to explain but sometimes it feels like someone pressing a finger onto my scalp or scratching me on the head. It's not localized to any one part of the head. I have also had on-and-off severe headaches. Finally, I've had a couple of weird muscle spasm episodes while working out – if I engage my abs even slightly they spasm over and over for 1-2 minutes and it is extremely painful.

I went to the doctor last week and had a workup that included a **comprehensive metabolic panel**, **magnesium/B12/iron tests**, **anti-nuclear antibody**, **A1C**, and **Sjögren's antibody** (I was diagnosed with Sjögren's 7 years ago after a similar episode but none of my doctors since have been convinced). Everything came back normal. My doctor called me to tell me that I likely just have anxiety and carpal tunnel syndrome and should come back in a month to see if things have changed. It was her opinion that any imaging at this point would be a ""waste of time and money"" as it is likely something transient.

Meanwhile, I feel like I'm getting worse. I have recently developed a bit of light sensitivity and driving during the day feels weird – I can barely drive around without sunglasses. I don't have vertigo or balance issues for now but certain movements just feel strange, almost like my depth perception is altered.

My symptoms come and go during the day. The tingling in my heels is more or less constant but the rest are worse in the morning and at night. At the moment it feels like both my calves are covered in biting ants.

Holding my leg straight is absolutely fine but any tiny little bend of the knee is 10/10 pain. Cry worthy. I go to the ER but they don’t have an MRI only X-ray.

Almost my entire family has gotten sick this past week, everyone else has recovered but me.

As I felt it, the symptoms started with just a sore throat for three days which then proceeded into further respiratory symptoms. These included a stuffy nose, coughing up thick, foul tasting phlegm; and sinus pressure to the point where it feels like my head is going to explode. I’ve also been told that I am “breathing loudly,” but it’s certainly not to the point of wheezing. My temperature has been slightly raised, but only around 100° F.

Both COVID and strep tests have come out negative, and the physician noticed “some fluid” in my ear but didn’t exactly elaborate on what she meant by that. I was prescribed amoxicillin to take for 10 days. 

I’m three days into the amoxicillin, and if anything it feels like I could be getting worse. However, there is an interesting difference between what I was prescribed and what my brother (who is now well) was prescribed. While I only got amoxicillin, my brother got amoxicillin AND clavulanic acid. I have no idea why our prescriptions are different if we came in for the same issue but I believe it has something to do with why he’s doing better and why I am not.

A quick Wikipedia search shows that clavulanic acid can help overcome antibiotic resistance.

464,AskDocs,"Hey guys. So I've had wheezing ever since I was a 
kid, and I was used to using an inhaler to get rid of it and it wasn't cause for concern. Fast forward to now, I've been feeling a shortness of breath since the last week. It immediately followed a sudden case of fever I got right before having to travel. However, this difficultly in breathing has stayed consistent this past week along with a periodic dry cough. The shortness of breath led to me feeling a bit light-headed too and it often leads to me feeling anxious due to the helplessness I feel in that situation, which in turn worsens my difficulty in breathing. I have no history of smoking. I've vaped a few times, but it's been almost once every 2 weeks for the past 5-6 months or so. I've tried weed only once and that's about it. I keep regretting my decision to even trying out the vape after 22 years of staying clear of smoking, thinking it is what is causing my difficulty in breathing. I visited a pulmonologist today and got a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) done, and he told me that my lung capacity has reduced, and that the test results after a dose of medication seemed to have improved my overall lung capacity and he's put me up on some meds for the next 10 days to observe if the meds have any effect or not on my condition.

My only bad habit is overthinking on what might be the cause and a constant surfing on the internet on the symptoms and I keep coming across COPD and honestly it scares me. So I'd like to know given this information, what might be the chances I might have or develop COPD? Other reddit users claim they've been smoking for years and vaping for years and still don't get diagnosed with COPD. However, it would put my mind at ease for knowing for once what is actually going on with me.

TLDR: I'm a 22 y/o and I've been having difficulties in breathing and a dry cough since the past week. Non-smoker, tried vape a few times recently and weed only once. I've had wheezing since I was much younger. Need to know the chances I might have or develop COPD

I've been suffering with chest pain in the sternum area for about 3 weeks, occasionally it drifts more to the right side of my chest. I visited my GP, who checked my 02 levels and diagnosed Costochondritis. I was unsure on this diagnosis as my chest is not sensitive to touch or pressure, I then presented and an urgent care unit who conducted an ECG and took my blood pressure to which they said was fine. The nurse assumed GERD and prescribed me with omeprazole 20 mg x 1 daily, this currently has had no effect on the chest pain.

My identical twin nieces were born a 9 days ago. They were 3 weeks early. At birth, Twin A was 5 lbs 13 oz &amp; twin B was 5 lbs 1 oz.

Hello, I'm a 36 year old male who was diagnosed with mild CP when I was a few months old. My childhood into my adolescence were challenging because of the constant PT, OT, and ST. As well as seizures and constant spasticity. Alot of my symptoms seemed to have abated from my mid teens through tomorrow mid twenties. 
I started getting mild symptoms again into my late twenties into my early thirties. These were increased pain, increasing spasticity, and exhaustion. Along with trouble with incontinence both Urinary and fecal. 
These were relatively mild at first until the past couple of years. I'm getting more involuntary  miscle movements, more pain, more incontinence and constipation. As well as more limited mobility have gone from limited use of a cane, to using a rolllator walker, or in-store scooters. 
I've torn multiple ligaments in every limb. I'm constantly exhausted even though I have controlled sleep apnea (I use a CPAP), and I take medication for my narcolepsy. 
I've already had bilateral carpal tunnel release. I need bilateral nerve release surgery in my forearms for my ulnar nerve, as well as  I need bilateral Tennis Elbow Surgery. I'm getting bilateral gastrocnemius lengthening surgery to relieve tension on my Achilles tendons. My right Achilles is ossifying and full of spurs. As well has bursitis in my feet.

475,AskDocs,"TL;DR: F21 with no known preexisting conditions and suspected family history of lipedema exhibiting all symptoms with the exception of pain. In the process of losing weight to improve physical health and appearance. 

Hello, I am currently in the process of losing weight through a combination of cleaner eating and exercising. I am a 5'4, 141 pound 21 year old female (at my lowest, during some mental health issues, I was 107 -- relevant to the medical history.) I have no known preexisting  conditions and I am not on any medications at the moment.

 Following puberty (age 10 when it first began), I noticed my legs were disproportionately large compared to the upper half of my body. I attributed it to bad genetics given that on my mother's side of the family, many of the women were pear-shaped and by the time they were elderly, many had visibly large hips and legs, and with that, knee issues. 

However, after losing 20 pounds (albeit in an  unhealthy way) and running everyday consistently for a few months, I noticed most of my body changing shape rapidly, but my legs remained the same. All throughout the following remainder of my teen years, my legs have remained disproportionately large compared to the rest of my body. I eventually gained the weight I lost back slowly through mindfulness and lack of exercising, but my legs continued to be consistently large. 

Among that, I have always suspected I had circulation issues in my legs. They're always cold, my feet are cold, and when doing intense aerobic exercises, I always get runner's itch (hives and itchiness) regardless of my consistency and duration of exercise.

Finally, I bruise easily on my legs only, sometimes without any probable causes and have typical lipedema fat depositing (especially around my knees and thighs, not so much calf issues.)  However, despite all of these symptoms, 

I don't want to bring this up to my primary provider until I'm for sure that lipedma could be a potential condition. I also do not want to necessarily face the diagnosis as I know treatment is likely surgery and management, or delaying progression if I opt out of surgery. Knowing, though, is better than not.

Sorry for the long, detailed post. I just wanted to be thorough for anyone on here giving me advice.

481,AskDocs,"TLDR; what is the normal procedure a plastic surgeon would do to fix a lump caused by traumatic fat necrosis; is it worth it if it's essentially free? \[28F\]

&amp;#x200B;

Fell down some stairs 9 months ago and there has been a lump on one cheek basically the size/shape of a computer wireless mouse (lol) ever since. Saw a plastic surgeon for a follow-up on a completely unrelated issue and figured I'd show him the lump because I didnt know what it was. He said it was traumatic fat necrosis and seems about right from what I have researched since. 

I wasn't really looking for a fix but he said he could do something\* to probably make it better - I am going back in a month anyway for something else quick, and he said he wouldn't charge me extra if I wanted him to try to fix the lump on my butt while I'm in the OR anyway. I'd be awake the whole time. 

Since it would be no additional cost to me I am kinda considering it. 

\*  
From what I understood from his explanation, he said he would remove additional normal fat from the area of the necrotic fat to kind of even out the lump. I definitely could have misunderstood, but my impression was he could not remove the necrotic fat itself, but removing additional normal tissue from that one area would help make it less noticeable. Makes sense to me, but from what I have read online, it sounds like it actually is possible to remove the necrotic tissue? Is it more likely I just misunderstood and he is saying he would remove the necrotic tissue? (this is more of a side question- more wondering what is 'normal' here)

Hi! My doctors are working so hard to help me and trying to figure this out, and I appreciate them so much. I just want to see if I could use some extra brains😂. 
For the last 2, almost 3, weeks, I’ve been feeling absolutely horrible. It started with a rash that my doctors are pretty sure was ringworm. About 4-5 days after getting this rash, I started getting super tired. I slept for about 17 hours one day, and now have been having a bunch of troubles with sleep. As a result of that, my upper eyelid has been switching for the past 5 days on and off, which is just annoying. I also have been getting some quick visual hallucinations that I’m hoping is just from lack of sleep. On top of that, I’ve had terrible headaches on and off, I’m dizzy quite often, all of my joints hurt, and my eyes hurt, like they’re very sensitive to light. It’s so weird because I got a concussion about a year ago, and I feel just like I did then, but I haven’t hit my head at all. I got an EKG, but my doctor said it looked okay, but just to make sure they want me to use a Holter monitor for 2 days. I do have a history of heart disease in my family (both sides). 

We’re just kind of stuck right now, any input or thoughts would be very helpful! I’m in my last couple weeks of school, and really don’t want to feel like this during exams, or at least be able to feel somewhat better by exams.

I can't feel the majority of either injury. I can feel a slight tickle that feels deep in my arm if I lightly tap certain spots multiple times. The area around it is also somewhat numb. Neither one hurts.

I'm thinking about seeing a doctor, but I feel like it's pointless because the damage is already done and otherwise it seems to be healing fine. It's also kind of obviously self inflicted and I'm reluctant to risk getting hospitalized or spending hours in the ER getting assessed (I have mental healthcare in place already).

490,AskDocs,"Hello, 

28M, 176cm at 82kg, EU. Rarely drink (1 beer or so), no smoke, no drugs. 

I took bromocriptine, slowly built up to 1 tablet / day for a year for hyperprolactinemia. After prolactin levels were normal, the dose was tapered down slowly and eventually was discontinued with prolactin levels in good range unmedicated. 

I noticed however that after 1-2 months after discontinuing the medication I became demotivated, indifferent and apathetic. Things I used to be excited for just didn't interest me and at the same time, I wasn't anxious about anything either. Sleep was less restful and felt more like a long nap. 

This went on for a good 9 months or so. I then decided to take a quarter of the pills I have left (I have 2 bottles extra because or the low dose I used). After the second day I felt better and more engaged now, taking bromocriptine. 

I looked up the brug before taking it, and I expected a DRD2 agonist to have some form of withdrawal for at least a month even after tapering down gradually. But this has been going on for 9 months at this point and I felt like myself only after taking the drug again, even if as low as a quarter a night.

The patch relatively smooth. If run my fingers over my foot with my eyes closed it doesn’t feel any differently from the rest of my foot. It’s been there for a couple weeks, possibly longer unnoticed, and hasn’t really changed much. It doesn’t hurt, or itch. I only notice when I look at my foot. Little concerned just because of the family history. But my father has a bit fairer skin and got a lot of exposure in Iraq. My grandmothers occurred on her nose fairly late in life. 

I do have yearly skin exams just to be safe and I’ll probably pop into have them look at it. But I thought I might just check in here to see if anyone had an opinion.

498,AskDocs,"F28 Caucasian. 5'4"" 205 lbs. Daily user of nicotine vape. Occasional alcohol (not mixed with opioids). Apologies in advance for the length.

I have had pain near my right ovary since getting PID from an IUD in 2016. It was removed but the infection badly scarred my fallopian tubes. On Feb 28 this year, I decided to try another IUD (Mirena). We took precautions to ensure no infection was present and the strings were cut short. Since then, the pain started to increase. They thought scar tissue had formed adhesions. Surgery on March 17 (ex lap) showed stage two endometriosis with partial obliteration of the cul-de-sac instead. I was on Percocet and 600 mg ibuprofen, alternating every three hours. Pain lessened until I got a UTI. Then a few days after that, the right kidney pain started. Took my last two Percocet to deal with the kidney and pelvic pain (I hadn't needed any in over a week) and wound up in the ER April 4 to rule out an infected kidney stone (I've had stones before). Three doses of fentanyl barely touched the pain, just made it so I wasn't crying from it anymore and I didn't care as much. 

CT was clean, and they sent me home with tramadol saying it was surgical pain. My OBGYN saw me a couple days later at my post op. Prescribed more Percocet since the tramadol wasn't helping at all, and added continuous NuvaRing to see if that would help. Since then, when it gets bad, it takes 2 Percocet, an extra 500-650 mg Tylenol, and 600 mg ibuprofen all at the same time is the only thing that takes the edge off. And it gets bad daily, worsening as the day goes on. I've had ultrasounds, CBC, urine cultures, and vaginal swabs to rule out infection. Yesterday I didn't notice that my Dr had messaged me on MyChart around 12:30 asking about the pain. When I did notice, it was after office hours.

I have two Percocet left and the pain is starting to get intense again. I've been trying to stick with Tylenol and the 600 mg ibuprofen but I'm not sure how long I can keep this up. I've not had any Percocet today. It's the weekend. Urgent care and the walk in clinic won't prescribe opioids, plus I don't wanna seem like I'm doctor shopping. I also don't want to come across as drug seeking if I end up back in the ER. I have a lot of chronic health issues and they know me well, but still. I'm not sure what to do. Percocet isn't cutting it but I don't want to become dependent on opioids either. Next step is a referral to the pain clinic but that could take weeks. I'm in tears by the end of the day most days, especially if the pain starts early. I'm not sure how to go about treating my pain in the meantime. Heating pads don't help. Hot baths don't help. Nothing is helping.

Recently the past 2 days when she has been eating she has complained of some epigastric pain. It’s close to in between her nipple line. 2 days ago it was in her RLQ. It hurt to the point she stopped eating and went to bed. She did try to go have a bowel movement but was unable to. It goes away when she’s not eating.  She does suffer from constipation and we do have to give her miralax despite her drinking adequate water. Is this something I should be okay to continue watching or would this warrant an ER visit?

So since a long time I've had itchiness mainly on my pubic area around the penis and just a bit on the penis but I thought it was normal. Right now I'm in a baltic country (came from Greece) where the climate is much more cold and my skin gets really dry. It is very itchy down there and I have developed a red rash that's pretty visible and big. Flakes appeared too and it felt very dry. I search it on google and thought I had a yeast infection (somehow) so I bought a cream for yeast infection and also an emollient soap and an emollient cream. I've applied them every day for a week, I don't get flakes since I use the emmolient but it's still itchy and the rash is there. Somedays I resist from scratching, some others I don't so I end up scratching and I think that way I stop the healing that's already happened. I don't have STDs.

I'm getting really anxious about it, it really affects my life.

504,AskDocs,"Bit of back story, my son is 5 and non verbal autistic, very developmentally delayed. He was diagnosed in the height of Covid. He was diagnosed without an ear check due to this as there were no face to face appointments. 

As such, his ears have never been checked by a doctor as they have been unable to convince him to look. Last time he had sore ears they prescribed antibiotics without putting him through the ordeal of touching his ears. I instead bought an ear camera and have slowly been getting him used to it in order me to be able to check the next time and screen record for the GP. 

I have managed to check his ears and get a couple of good shots. The first photo (left ear) is the one he is complaining about which I suspect has an ear infection. The second photo (right ear)- he isn’t complaining about but the drum is bulging, pure white and looks (in my very unqualified opinion) looks dreadful. 

Could anyone take a look and see what they think, this is the first time anyone has seen inside his ears and I’m concerned about glue ear. Although I don’t know if that’s hard to see when there is an active ear infection. 

Also, I know the ear camera isn’t ideal, but it’s sterilised and it’s the best we can do at this moment in time. 

Thank you.

515,AskDocs,"23F, no medication, chronic sinus pain or vasomotor rhinitis (doctors still aren’t sure what I have); ectopics and vit D deficiency 

Hi everyone, I’ve noticed for a while now that when I do any heavy exercise, I get these weird visual disturbances in both of my eyes. They look like moving kaleidoscopic images right in the center of my vision, but they don’t have any color to them. They’re black and white and transparent, I’m not sure how best to explain it. They’re not blind spots, as I can still see through them, but they are still noticeable enough (they kinda look like this, but not colourful: https://imgur.com/a/2t7JZjz). I usually spot them when I look at the sky (I think that’s because there’s less visual clutter and so easier to spot), but once I realize they’re happening, I start noticing them when I look at anything else around me.
They seem to stop soon after I finish exercising. 

I don’t think they’re ocular migraines, because I had one of those last year and it was completely different, much more colorful and I actually couldn’t see well because of it (it was blocking the vision in my left eye almost completely). That was the only time I had one of those, and the doctors said that it wasn’t anything to worry about. 
I don’t know if these events are at all connected, but I thought it would be good to mention.

Also, back in July of last year, I started getting heart palpitations out of nowhere, but again, my cardiologist did some tests and told me they're just harmless ectopics. 
I also suffer from chronic sinus pain and headaches, and doctors aren't sure yet what's happening. 
Apart from that my blood tests have always been good, with the exception of a small vit D deficiency (which I'm treating). 

It woud be nice to find out why I'm getting these, since they're a bit scary at times.",t2_a5zh5uwk,0,Visual disturbance during exercise in both eyes,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12nh9au,True,CarelessSerenity,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12nh9au/visual_disturbance_during_exercise_in_both_eyes/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12nh9au/visual_disturbance_during_exercise_in_both_eyes/,475010,1681590053,0,,False,1681590067,1681590068,2023-04-15 20:20:53,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=93149b6577b4ee9f6c45c09edd02f43f492015e0', 'width': 1300, 'height': 1300}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40651293b8f568dc1080900b127d78e63a4f551a', 'width': 108, 'height': 108}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eb3696f42f368fb3d54a9c4aa1b88f87c29f1fc7', 'width': 216, 'height': 216}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dd75146e6e159151d24ab1e44e1ee5d4c2a3e12d', 'width': 320, 'height': 320}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2c7a9eacb51204f24cdcf89722aa7f551bf7550', 'width': 640, 'height': 640}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8b6ac9b0c2c5998200bef9c54460dcb23966d3f', 'width': 960, 'height': 960}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9uZF45DePWKd79JQiOrTxRv5t7jN2CM04Ir2Fq-8jEQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0c0de2c0fd147ea0121d15441db3967df26c0015', 'width': 1080, 'height': 1080}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'aSZlwl7cdubfkYFNX2za1NoO9P3hlh_EBBWE6jefzIU'}], 'enabled': False}",

It was not until recently recently I discovered has a dirty dirty secret. That dirty secret is their home and their car. It seems as though they…horde… trash? But it’s more than that. 

Their car (a very nice new car they just got last year)  is filled to the brim with trash, mostly bottles and cans, the console is littered with dirty and other sticky debris. The smell is something similar to a pepperoni pizza with olives but sour. I refused to get in it when they offered to drive somewhere. 

Their bathroom is… beyond despicable. Feminine hygiene products all over the floor, can even see the floor because of the laundry and trash. The sink is full of some junk I don’t even know what. There’s a glass of water in there that has mold growing on the top. It looks like when they ran out of TP they started using the shower curtain. 

In the kitchen, there are no dishes in the cupboard because they’re all on the sink or her bedroom floor. Mold, ants, probably roaches and soon to be rats if they haven’t come already. 

Their bedroom you can’t see the floor. Every square inch of floor is covered in clothes or dishes, their closet is empty cause it’s all on the floor. Rotten food and mold and a pungent odor. 

I also recently started noticing they have a faint smell of trash that follows them everywhere, like the notorious trash bag smell. 

I don’t think even if I was at my dirtiest, never cleaned for a year straight could I possibly make the mess they made. It’s almost like it’s intentional. Like they must throw every piece of trash and dish and food on the floor and just keep adding to it. 

My concern for them is their health. Mental and physical. Their apartment has a humidity issue and smells of moldy. This cannot be healthy for them, especially their lungs. Also their quality of life must be so low, I cannot even imagine living in the rathole.

521,AskDocs,"Last week I noticed a slight tingling sensation in my left hand when I sat down by my desk to play on my computer. After sleeping it off, it went away. That next day, I hung out with friends for Easter and had a couple drinks and smoked a small amount of weed. At the end of the day, the same sensation from yesterday occurred and I thought I’d just get some rest and it would be fine. The next morning it was still there. I figured I’d just keep going like normal and it would go away.

The following day when I woke up out of bed, I noticed that some of my toes on my left foot had also started to feel numb as well, and that made me concerned. I went to an urgent care doctor and the woman who talked with me had me perform the Tinels sign and Phalens test to see if I had carpal tunnel. I have persistent numbness in my thumb and index finger, but neither test made the numbness worse or gave me any other sensations. The doctor said I may not have carpal tunnel but some kind of inflammation or a repetitive injury from using my hands (I game a lot and both of my jobs require me to use my hands a lot). She couldn’t give me any explanation for my toes other than me being dehydrated or deficient in vitamins. She said my blood work was fine and didn’t indicate an illness. I have never had my vitamin levels tested.

524,AskDocs," Hey all, 35M here, both Friday and Saturday I was out in natural areas. On Friday we pulled a tick from my friend and we were in a high risk Lyme disease area. (I know this could be unrelated but wanted to include the information). Sunday night I began to notice flu-like symptoms, fatigue, chills, body aching. I also started to notice this development on my hand.

[https://imgur.com/a/TZcYm3G](https://imgur.com/a/TZcYm3G)

Tuesday I went to see a doctor. The doctor didn't comment on my flu-like symptoms at all. He looked at it and suggested it was a minor staph aureus infection. He said I could put polysporin on it and that there was no risk but if it didn't get better then eventually I would have to take antibiotics and he sent me on my way. I requested a prescription for antibiotics just in case and he prescribed me keflex (cephalexin) (500mg) qid 7 days.

Unsatisfied, I went to see a different doctor the next day. He seemed more concerned than the other doctor. Suggested my flu-like symptoms were because the infection was spreading and I was having a systemic response to it. He said I should start oral antibiotics soon otherwise the infection could spread up my arm and I could end up in the hospital. He did not comment on what he thought the infection was. He prescribed amoxicillin (875mg) / clavulanic acid (125mg). Bid 7 days

Neither doctor thought there was any risk of Lyme disease.

I chose to start the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as I felt a lot better with that doctor.

The flu-like symptoms seemed to have now passed.

My questions are:

1. Do you think there's any risk of Lyme? Could Lyme look like this at the 4-5 day mark?

I have suffered anxiety for the last few years and I personally think due to having wheat exercise induced anaphylaxis - however I spent a long period of time not knowing what I was allergic too and was admitted A&amp;E over 10 times with an anaphylactic shock! Now every time I go away somewhere I always experience anxiety. 

But, separate issue - I always feel horrific for around 1-2 weeks after alcohol (3 pints or more) and when I say horrific I mean - extremely painful muscles, burning sensation all over body, sweating,  insomnia, migraines, fatigue - the list goes on!.. and this typically starts the day after alcohol and lasts for 1-2 weeks. 

I can get away with a pint and feel fine but anymore than 3 it feels horrific, so much so I’ve now given up alcohol. 

I googled my symptoms and it comes up as alcohol myopathy but on their it seems more for alcoholics? I’m not an alcoholic but with my jobs I have binge drinked every other weekend/ every three weeks to excess - only recently that has called down. 

Could it be alcohol myopathy? Or an intolerance or something?

533,AskDocs,"First time posting on Reddit and I know it’s a shot in the dark but I feel hopeless and am getting nowhere with any of my doctors as far as a diagnosis or finding relief. Any help or insight is much appreciated.

I am a 33yr old male ,6.2 , 168lbs … never had any health issues in my life.



The issues:

There seems to be 3 things happening at once.

1. I have a sour heavy full feeling in the lower left quadrant most days…. Doesn’t matter if I’ve eaten or not. Feel the same way after a meal.

2. I am getting muscle spasms in my lower abdominal area on the bottom left, middle and right side just above the pubic area and below the belly button.

3. I noticed I was having muscle tenderness/pain on both right and left where psoas/ iliacas muscles are and obliques at the same time all of this started happening with my stomach. 
- I saw my PT for this sensation and he noted that they are most likely extremely tight for some reason and started therapy for it.

The scenario:

2 months ago I ate out for dinner, I had a grilled chicken caesar salad, and French onion soup - later than night didn’t feel too hot, but wasn’t terrible. The next day I had a stomach ache and started feeling really bloated. Within a few days the discomfort increased, I felt like I had pains in my abdomen, a dull discomfort in the lower section, and I felt like I was hungry all the time (that burning sensation when you don’t eat for awhile) even after just eating a full meal.
This is when I started noticing the muscle tenderness/soreness that felt like I had pulled a stomach muscle- which my PT believes is extremely tight PSOAS muscles. When massaging them it hurts a lot.

That discomfort lasted for two weeks and got worse so I went to the E.R. Because my PCP refused to do any testing or give me any course of action to take.

I had a CT Scan, bloodwork, stool sample, and urine test…. Doctors said everything looked normal. ( they stayed no signs of masses, appendicitis, diverticulitis, etc…) Gave me bentyl for stomach spasms and sent me on my way. That was month and a half ago… the discomfort, is still there.

Fast forward - it’s been about 2 1/2 months with this issue and I am not seeing any progress to returning to normal.

I have seen a GI and all he said was, could be IBS, take probiotics if you want and sent me on my way. Tried Visbiome which was recommended and they destroyed my stomach and made spasms very intense. I have stopped taking those.

I have been using a low fodmap diet, not seeing a ton of relief, I have been eating a lot healthier since all of this and still have the same issues. 

I know when something doesn’t feel right and it’s not normal to have this feeling. I’ve never had this for months on end, let along longer then a week.

A few things other worth noting:

Last year something similar happened but went away within a week. I had an ultrasound and everything looked normal- slight excess amount of gas but nothing concerning they said. They found a malerotated kidney but said it’s nothing to worry about..

I was also tested last year for celiac, h. Pylori, usual bloodwork and everything was normal…. I even tried reducing gluten for the hell of it and didn’t see any results.

My whole life I could eat pizza one day and be fine, and then 3 weeks later have pizza and feel super sick and have to go to the bathroom. Same deal with cheesesteaks or any other greasy food, but it was always sporadic and never consistent. That being said I don’t really think gluten is a huge factor but I am open to anything at this point.

It’s been over 2 months and everyday life is becoming miserable dealing with this pain.

Height: 5'8""

Gender: Female 

Medications: Tacrolimus 0.1% and Cortizone 10

Smoking status: very occasional

In November last year, I felt my lips start to itch and get a different texture. Within a few days, my lips began to get so dry that cracks appeared, and small cuts when I smiled and moved my mouth a lot. 
Then the whole skin started to peel and itch even more. And it only started to get better after there was no protective skin left and the entire area was completely sensitive.

What brought a lot of relief was the continuous use of Aquaphor ointment.

I went to a dermatologist in Brazil who evaluated it and said it was not contagious. It seemed to be derived from emotional stress, diagnosed it as atopic dermatitis, and gave me an ointment with tacrolimus 0.1%.

The medicine did not do the desired effect, so recently, on my own, I decided to use Cortizone 10 ointment on the ends of my lips, and this is the only thing that has brought me an immediate result. The next day I woke up, and the skin started to improve again. 

But, I know this medicine should not be used constantly as I have been using it, least of all in the mouth area. Besides, I can't stand treating the symptom and not the problem anymore because it keeps happening even with the use of Cortizone. 

Does anyone know what this could be and how to treat it correctly?

**History:** well-controlled ADHD + mild depression, idiopathic peripheral neuropathy, childbirth x3
**Current meds:** Vyvanse 4+ mos, Lexapro + Wellbutrin 2+ yrs

**Background:**
I began experiencing numbness, tingling, and extreme sensitivity in my toes in late 2019/early 2020. Concurrently I was also experiencing bouts of severe fatigue, increased clumsiness/lack of coordination, and brain fog. Primary care referred me to Neurology where an EMG and nerve conduction study revealed small and large fiber neuropathy. Next step was a skin biopsy but then, hello COVID. 

Fast forward a couple of years and a move, and I'm finally getting re-established all over again. Over the last few years the neuropathy has continued to worsen, I have almost no feeling in my toes and experience it in my hands off and on. I've also developed a strong reaction to cold in my fingers, they turn white and then tingle and burn red when warmed again. In addition to the fatigue and brain fog, I also get periods where I'm extremely sensitive to temperature in general. I'll randomly get very flushed on my neck and chest and sweat like crazy, both day and night. All of these 'symptoms' seem to come and go in surges, where they'll be really bad for a while then subside and I'll be fine for a while. Then it starts over again. 

Recent repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies still show small and large fiber sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy, and further tests have ruled out most primary causes (not diabetic, no alcohol abuse, no heavy metal exposure, B12 is fine, etc.) My new neurologist has ordered a bunch of additional blood tests, EEG, and MRI to see if we can find the cause of the neuropathy and other possibly correlated symptoms.

I've just received some of my blood test results, but wait times are super long here and I have 8 weeks before my follow-up. I'd like to arm myself with as much knowledge as possible so I don't overthink it or resort to Dr. Google (never a good idea!).

Are the following results significant? Others not mentioned came back within normal limits, and I still have several tests pending.

I have always had a pretty bad memory. Both long term memory and short term/working memory. However, lately I feel like it’s been getting worse. Sometimes simple things I have to really think about. Last night I was thinking about how old I was and even trying to calculate it based on what year I was born took me a few minutes. Ive been losing track of some conversations partway through. I have always had to make sure to put most of my “to-do” things/appointments or even just basic things I want or need to remember in my reminders on my phone, but I feel lately that I’ve had to do that more and more, and with more little things. I know that anxiety/ADHD/sleep apnea can be a contributing factor for memory issues, but would that be a reason for the sudden progression? It’s starting to really concern me.

She has recommended each year a high fiber, protein focused diet and I’ll be honest, I’m a stress eater so I often fail at it and turn to junk food. 

My last blood work (June 2022) had these values:

Total cholesterol: 336 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 187 mg/dL
HDL: 89 mg/dL

These numbers are consistent with the 2021 numbers. My liver enzymes are within normal range luckily so I don’t have NAFLD. Other BMP, CBC normal, UA normal. 

I didn’t think much of this as I have no context for what this means except high, but then my mom was prescribed a statin with much lower numbers and she didn’t take the medicine.

After digging around online, my numbers seem VERY high compared to what people who have high cholesterol measure in at.

565,AskDocs,"Hi everyone,

I have been struggling with skin rash/allergies for years. It first appeared about 5 years ago on my lower back, and I went to a dermatologist and she told me it was fungal so she prescribed me an azole. It did not work, so I went back to get a biopsy, but she never got back to me with the results. It cleared, and I thought it went away for good, but it appeared again. For about 3 years it always happened on my lower back, and I went to a second dermatologist who told me it was contact dermatitis and prescribed me a steroid. I used it, and was allergic. She took a biopsy, and prescribed me a non-steroidal cream. Did not work, but we found out that I was allergic to a type of detergent. I swapped out the detergent and it went away for the longest time, and came back again. I think it might be residue on the detergent, so I washed all my clothes, but this time the rash just never went away. My lower back has completely healed and the rash never got back after I swapped out the detergent, but now the rash is on my ribcage where my sports bra usually sits. This time, it started after I wore a sports bra and I felt itchy. I started taking loratadine because I had a sunscreen allergy before and it worked, but this time every time it gets better, it starts getting inflamed again. It goes through a cycle of first being itchy, then raised and red, then flares up and then goes away a little, turns brown, and skin starts flaking, then it becomes itchy again. I have been taking loratadine for 20 days now. Yesterday I felt itchy so I put an ice cube on my skin, and today it started being super raised and red. I also noticed that hot showers exacerbate it. I have tried baggy clothing, eating non-inflammatory food, tried all the creams out there and went to two dermatologists but none worked. I have no idea what to do.

Background: F, 24, 5'2"", 108 pounds, on and off for 5 years, recent flare up been a month, no existing medical issues, current medication only loratadine 10mg, occasional drinker, never smoked and no recreational drugs, healthy lifestyle (gym 5 days a week + always on a diet).

I got bit on the finger by what I believe to be a spider bite. I saw 2 puncture wounds before it started swelling and forming ""puss"", I left it without popping as long as I could but after 2 days it was so tight and painful I used a sanitized needle to pop a small hole to relieve the pressure. I didn't push on it or anything, just let it naturally drain. Now day 3 the red ring is much larger, there's more white ""puss"", clear liquid oozing, and this very defined small purple squiggly line.

It almost looks like a blue BIC pen line. Since I cannot confirm is was a spider bite, should I be worried about this? Sounds silly but I immediately thought of a worm or parasite.

568,AskDocs,"Im intrigued to find out what peoples experiences have been with abdominal hernias.

Im a 34yr old male and have been suffering bowel issues for over a month now. My symptoms include

- flatter stools
- stools that can be 2-3” in length and pencil thin
- straining 
- tenesmus (or however you spell it)

I’ve not had bloody stools, but have recently started seeing some small light red specs on occasions. Doctor has already put a finger up my bum and not found haemorrhoids.

I have got a small pea sized lump on my abdomen that feels kinda hard. This lump is less pronounced when lying down, however if I feel for it I can find it. It also feels like it bulges slightly when I cough.

It has never caused any discomfort, however I’m not starting to experience some very mild constant discomfort on the right side of my abdomen, and feel discomfort at times from the area of the lump. These has only started the last few weeks.

The lump is above my belly button by approx and inch and slightly off to the right side.

Could this be a hernia? And could it be a reason as to why I’m having bowel issues?

Diagnosis:
PTSD 

I have been having a hard to describe feeling that has come and gone my entire life, but it’s been worse lately. I’m scared to bring it up to my psychiatrist / therapist until I can put a name to it or describe it better. In my sleep, nightmares/night terrors and sleepwalking/waking up abruptly not knowing how I ended up in another room crying/yelling has not been uncommon. But lately, it’s just been this really deep and scary feeling of paranoia, like something is deeply wrong or out to get me or that I’m losing my mind. It’s really strong when I wake up in the middle of the night. Last night, I woke up to find that my windows had been “barricaded” with stuff like pillows and chairs which i have no memory of doing, but i do have a memory of feeling like people were out to get me or going to come in my window. I never feel like this during the day or experience paranoia like this. Often when I’m half asleep after waking up in the middle of the night, I have this horrible anxiety that I’m slowly losing touch with reality and have vivid hallucinations while falling asleep of scary things or that people are talking to me. Sometimes I wake up having an entire conversation with no one until I come to and realize nothing is there or happening. 

Again, this has never happened during the day, I never “hear voices” or talk to no one or have paranoia. I’m actually able to handle my PTSD very well - I never miss my medication doses, I can hold a job well, hold a steady social life and go to therapy weekly, as well as take care of my dog well. This doesn’t disrupt my daily life. But regardless of whether or not I take the trazedone or melatonin, I always have this issue. And it scares the hell out of me. I only experienced it briefly in highschool, sometimes having panic attacks half asleep thinking there were “demons” around. Anytime I was fully awake, I was aware of how ridiculous this was. This is only related to sleep.

I was prescribed prazosin but have yet to take it, Im scared of throwing something new in the mix but it may be a good idea. I just don’t want this to get worse.

C has specifically mentioned Radiaxct and afaik it's one of the advanced machines for RT, whereas A has not mentioned deatils of machine, while B said either TrueBeam and/or Versa.

Should/could she wait for centre C due to their use of modern machine namely Radiaxct, or going ahead with A or B is fine? Is there any optimal timing for RT post chemo?

584,AskDocs,"Hello all,

**INFO:** I’m a 24M, white, non-smoker, and occasional drinker. I weigh approx. 160 lbs and stand about 5’7” tall. 

**DOCTOR’S VISITATION SUMMARY:** I went to my general practitioner recently for an issue I’m having with my sinuses. He told me it could just be my sinuses acting up and prescribed me a nasal spray in addition to telling me to try over-the-counter allergy medications. 

**SYMPTOMS:** 

My eyes get watery, particularly my left one. 

Muscles feel fatigue. 

My ears feel like water will trickle out of them occasionally and when I rub a tissue in my outer ear, it picks up a watery substance but not a lot.

My nose is congested but nothing unordinary. 

My chest has a slight ache and a tickle in my throat will make me cough once in awhile but nothing terrible.

My throat feels sore. 

I will wake up with the back part of my throat feeling sore and I have to snort to unclog it. When I do, it’s just wads of dry mucus. I blow my nose to clear my nose and it’s mostly a mix of regular looking mucus with dry clumps. Throughout the day, my mucus becomes watery to the point it’ll just drip from my nose like a faucet that can’t be turned all the way off. 

**DURATION:** I feel like this started about two weeks ago when just my left ear hurt and felt “clogged” (it wasn’t.) Eventually, it was just a pimple in my ear but my eardrum still felt weird. My doc said they were unrelated but I wanted to mention it just in case. 

 About a week later, the symptoms I described above occurred.

**FINAL:** I tested for COVID-19 the last three days and each test came back negative. I’m at a loss and can’t believe this is JUST allergies. If they are, they have NEVER been this bad for me.

We have used condoms and tried to be careful but some accidents have happened. 

No crazy accidents like a condom breaking or anything but enough to make her want to take a plan B the following day 





A couple weeks passed and she has now missed her period by 7 days. She took a pregnancy test yesterday and it came back negative. 




I’m not super Knowledgeable about this,


I read online that taking plan B may interfere with your cycle and delay your period but I’m not sure. 

Was the test used properly? Would it read a accurate result if used 6 days after she missed her period? 


I’m just confused on testing and when should she take the test for the most accurate results.

Like if I didn't stand up and rub it in time it would've broken or something, the pain was steadily increasing.

596,AskDocs,"For my son.


Age: 8 months old
Weight and height: 20 pounds and 2 foot
No medications being taken
No smoking
No current medical issues
Location of complaint: head

I’ll start with saying we took him immediately to the ER and got seen by a neurosurgeon at a pediatric hospital afterwards. They said he was good to go after observing him for a few hours and said his CT scan was clear of any bleeding or fractures by both the ER and neurosurgeon at at the pediatric hospital.


I was at work and my wife called me and told my son fell back off of the couch, which is about a foot and half up off the floor (which is hard tile, there is a rug there as well about a quarter of an inch thick if that.)

She picked him up and then said he was crying but then he stopped and his eyes rolled to the back of his head, he started bubbling at his mouth and got stiff. Wasn’t responding to anything. I work at the hospital where we brought him into the ED at and I saw him, I was moving him but he was responding either so they called in a code and gave him some diastate 2.5 mg to help him out. After they gave him that I saw him start moving and making noises. Afterwards they took a CT scan on him which, at that point I was informed by one of the doctors there it was clear from any  fractures or bleeds. However, I was also told that since there wasn’t a radiologist there the doctor told me she couldn’t say for sure. At this point they send us to the pediatric hospital where he was seen by the neurosurgeon, who told us she didn’t see anything either and it looked clear to her as well. Afterwards we were three from about 10:30-5:00 pm. During the time we waited he fell asleep and ate like normal, didn’t throw up or anything. Neurosurgeon came back and did some other tests, he grabbed some keys she had  and played with them like he normally does with things. From there they discharged us and said to watch him over the next 48 hours for any changes in behavior or anything out the norm. Neurosurgeon stated she doesn’t think he had a seizure but doesn’t know for sure since the scan was done about 20-25 minutes after he arrived and wasn’t sure if it was done too early. For a bit of a better timeline of events, he fell about 8:59 a.m. and arrived at the hospital about 9:05 a.m

So after we got home he’s been completely normal. Even today he’s been fine. He has a regular check up in about two weeks but I want to do a follow up and wanted your alls advice due to the fact of how he was immediately after the fall, since that seemed to be the part that had most of the providers a little stumped. I did on searching on google ( I know) to see if I could find anything similar to the situation but found nothing that seemed similar to it. They way a nurse and the neurosurgeon explained what it was, was that it could’ve been he had response to the trauma of the pain and that his was reaction was what made him go into that state. I apologize for the long read but there was no short that had enough info.

But the main concern is that, I play a good bit of sports and my height sometimes becomes detrimental to my performance. It's not the only reason I want to undergo the surgery, but if my athleticism is compromised in any way because of the surgery then it kills any desire for taking it.

I have read about how ppl run, and weight lift after the surgery. But never about anyone sprinting or kicking with full force.

Initially I thought it was just like a pimple or ingrown (though I haven’t shaved recently). I am not currently sexually active since my last STD tests which were clean. It’s been getting more tender and not really going away over the last 24 hours. I’ve tried to use just like a warm washcloth which helps a little with the tenderness but not the swelling or anything. That did seem to like drain it a little actually as a pimple would. 

I already have an appointment with my PCP Monday for a general physical so I’ll ask then if it’s not better but is this a more urgent issue that can’t wait 2 days? Should I make an appointment with a dermatologist or OBGYN instead? Anything else I can do in the meantime?

I had an echocardiogram two weeks ago due to occasional shortness of breath and peripheral edema. The echo came back showing “trace pericardial effusion.” As far as I know, I haven’t gotten sick lately, and haven’t had blunt trauma to my chest. I then looked at an old echocardiogram I had at the ER in July 2022, and likewise it said I have a “small pericardial effusion” — so this is a chronic issue. Those echos were otherwise normal. 

My August 2021 echocardiogram did not find any effusion, so it appeared sometime between summer 2021 and summer 2022. 

Then I had a urinalysis exam, and it said I have a bit of proteinuria. 

My TSH, if that matters, was 2.24 early on the day of the urinalysis and 5.27 later on the same day. BNP &lt;5 pg/mL. Normal eGFR. Normal CBC &amp; CMP tests.

602,AskDocs,"29 year old female, 270 lbs, 5’8, healthy other than being obese. Living in the Netherlands. 

I have been dealing with an upper respiratory problem for 2 months. This started as a cold and then moved into my chest. It created a crackling wheeze on inhale and exhale. I went to the doctor for it, and they said that it could be an infection if it persists but it seems more like asthma. The doctors kept treating me for asthma, but I kept getting sicker, and I was on 40mg/day prednisone and a beclomatasone maintenance inhaler for a few weeks. I explained that I had asthma symptoms in childhood but this is not normal for me, maybe I have an infection? The gp said that it’s definitely asthma, and they won’t give me antibiotics because my CRP levels are too low to justify this. They scheduled a spirometry test for a few months in the future when they suspected the symptoms would go away. 

Mid March I was coughing and felt a pop and stabbing pain in my chest. One day I saw a streak of blood in the mucus I hacked up, and didn’t see any more after that to this day. I Was given a chest X-ray to rule out a pulmonary embolism in early March, and they said I have some inflammation but to just keep using inhalers.  They were going to give me a ct scan but decided not to because my labs didn’t justify the test. 

Was sent home, kept getting worse. I was coughing really hard for a long time. I was really suffocating… couldn’t even walk from my couch to the bathroom without getting out of breath. I had a lot of chest pain and was told it was just muscle pulls and uncontrolled asthma. They instructed me to take 1200 mg ibuprofen and 4000 mg paracetamol for the pain. I was finally given antibiotics after about 8 weeks (1500 mg/day 5 days). I started feeling better with lessening symptoms for a week, and then I caught a cold from my daughter (or not, she came home with a cold and I got sick a few days later again, it could’ve just been the same thing for all I know). 

Time passed and I wasn’t as sick as I was- I could still breathe, but it seemed like I was getting sicker again. a lot of coughing with a lot of mucus coming up. I was in total pain to the point I couldn’t bend, twist, clean myself etc. Earlier this week the chest pain was becoming unbearable. I also explained that I don’t want to keep taking so much ibuprofen and paracetamol because of the liver damage potential (it’s been weeks). I finally wore my gp down and she referred me for emergency services. I Went to the hospital for it, and they discovered I have pleural effusion from the X-ray. They also saw that I had a fever of 38° (mind you this is the first time I’m off ibuprofen and paracetamol in a while). 

At the hospital they tried to do a ct scan to check for a pulmonary embolism but there was an error, and they couldn’t read the area the PE would’ve been in, but the physician saw that I have 6 broken ribs all at different stages of healing, but some of them were fresh. I don’t have copies of the scans, just the reports. I asked to have them redo the ct scan but they said they can’t justify it because my symptoms are more easily explained by the bone breaks and not a pulmonary embolism. I was given pain medicine and sent home.  I got an ultrasound done a few days after, and all my other internal organs seem ok. I need to have an appointment with an internist specialist to figure out why I had six ribs break (like get a bone density scan or whatever) but they’re taking forever to process the referral. 

I also had blood work, which discovered that I have an iron deficiency and an infection (high on trombocyten, reticulocyten, reticulocyten relative, crp, LDH, haptoglobine, Erythrocyte sedimentation… low on Mcv, hemoglobin, iron and iron saturation). The doctor told me I’m probably fine and that I need to get more blood work done in 4 weeks after taking an iron supplement. I asked what about the infection? They said they didn’t have enough evidence that it’s bacterial so no antibiotics. Im still coughing up a considerable amount of green mucus but now that I’m on pain medicine I can breathe more easily. 

I googled a little bit and reminded them of something I brought up at every appointment I’ve had. They kept asking me if I had been on any long flights anywhere, and I always listed the countries. One of those countries is endemic with TB. I asked: could this be tb? They said, no it’s doubtful because I wasn’t at a hospital there. My gp consulted a public health official from our local government and now the local government wants to do a sputum test. 

1. I should probably stay home from work and inside generally until I get the tb test done right?

2. Does this sound like tb? I have zero appetite and I’m coughing up mucus but no blood. I haven’t lost weight because I eat anyway. Maybe a couple lbs max? Nobody can know til I get a result from a test but does it even sound like tb?

3. If I have six broken ribs? they said nobody can tell me that but it takes 4-6 weeks to feel better and should go back when I feel okay. Idk what that means and they shrug when I ask. How do I know I can return? Should I be totally pain free?


4. Do you think this situation was handled well? People are saying I should complain but it also seems like they tried their best. 


5. Is there something missing that could be a solution? My mental health bandwidth is really maxed out from all of this and im desperate to have my life go back to normal.

The link to the pictures is above. I (22F) found out I was pregnant last Monday. I took 3 positive pregnancy tests. The date of my last period was February 20th, so they day I found out, I couldn’t have been any farther than 6 weeks. Saturday and Sunday, I started spotting. It was light blood so I wasn’t too worried. Monday, I started getting light cramps that felt like my period was on the way or something. I had a little bit more blood on my underwear this day. Tuesday, I had cramps that felt very similar to period cramps, I felt uncomfortable all day and I got a sharp pain in my back. I was bleeding about the same amount I was on Monday, but around dinner time, I felt a gush of blood. I went to the bathroom and my panty liner was soaked. About 2 hrs later, I passed the first clot. About 2 1/2 hrs later, I passed that second clot. The second one alarmed me because it looks like the shape of a fetus, but then again this was my first pregnancy and I didn’t really know how they were supposed to look. I called my gyno the next day and she said if I was filling a pad in an hour (I wasn’t) or have severe cramps (the cramps were bad, but not that bad. Almost like period cramps) then I should go to the ER. But, she said if not then I’m going to schedule you for bloodwork. So I got blood work done and she called with my results and said that my progesterone level was .65 which was really low and my hgc was 118. She told me that since my levels were so low, it was either a pregnancy where the sperm didn’t create an embryo, or that I am going through a miscarriage. She said that she wants me to go get more blood work either today or tomorrow to confirm that it was a miscarriage and my levels are going down. She said if it comes back around the same, then I’ll get more blood work in a week to see if it’s going down and confirm that I passed everything. I just don’t know if that second clot could possibly be the fetus because it looks like it has a head and a tail, or if there’s no way possible and I didn’t even pass it yet.",t2_f7gus0uw,0,"I had a

I take Diamox 1000mg, Lamotrigine 50mg, hydroxyzine 50mg, clonidine as needed, omeprazole, and a daily allergy pill. Ever since my periods started, they've been horrifically painful and heavy. I got my first period when I was around 8 or 9 and it was just horrible from the start. I have big blood clots, cramps that are so painful I take sleeping pills in the daytime to sleep away the pain, I have a prescription of 600mg ibuprofen for my pain and bleeding as well but it's not very effective. I get horrible pelvic pain, my legs ache, it's difficult to use the bathroom to pee or poop because it causes more pain, it's hard to stand or do anything. My bleeding has caused me to become anemic and it's only getting worse with each period. I was tested for thyroid disease and hormonal imbalances but everything came back fine besides one hormone level which was DHEA. It was elevated but I guess not elevated enough to investigate further, although I was told there is a very rare and slight chance my elevated level DHEA could mean I have congenital adrenal hyperplasia but my doctor was not concerned about this and left it at that. I went to a gynecologist who explained basically my only 2 options are take ibuprofen for my periods or go on birth control to regulate them. Due to my Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, my neurologist has told me to not go on any form of birth control until my intracranial pressure is completely gone or cleared up. I also have migraines with brainstem aura and was told by my neurologist that birth controls, especially ones with estrogen can raise the risk for stroke with patients who suffer from these types of migraines. I guess my question is what the heck am I supposed to do..? The ibuprofen is not even working and I can't go on birth control. PCOS and endometriosis run in my family as well as hormonal problems. I'm getting a pelvic ultrasound done on Tuesday but I literally can't suffer like this. I get symptoms weeks before my period even comes and then it still hurts when it's gone. It's impossible to live like this. Plus I'll keep becoming more anemic. Please share any tips. I have a heating pad that burns my skin from how hot I have to keep it to help my cramps.

I recently changed my anti-depressant from 150mg of Zoloft to 150mg of Wellbutrin ... don't know if that has anything to do with anything but felt like I'd share.  I don't drink or smoke (smoked from age 15 to age 30) and no recreational drugs.  I tested positive for Covid in early Feburary of this year.  Because I am high risk (born with only one kidney/depression/overweight) I immediately contacted my doctor and got on Paxlovid.  This helped tremendously to manage my symptoms and I was feeling better in 1 week.  I still had a nagging cough that wouldn't seem to go away.  I went back to my doctor who told me I had bronchitis and prescribed me steroids, an inhaler and cough meds.  When she listened to my lungs the doctor told me they sounded clear, my BP was 125/75 and my o2 was 98%.  I took the full schedule of meds but my cough was not going away.  It actually felt like the cough was getting worse.  I reached back out to my doctor who then put me on another round of the cough meds.  On top of that I have been taking OTC cough meds (Mucinex), sleeping with a humidifier next to my bed, and putting vicks on my chest before bed.  Early this month (April) it felt like my cough was getting better.  I started having these violent coughing outbursts where I would cough so hard it would trigger my gag reflex.  When this would happen I would spit and I noticed blood in my sputum.  This was genuinely terrifying and I wanted to track down the source.  I looked online for any information and found that for the most part blood in the sputum was inconsequential.    
I realize that returning to the doctor is more than likely a correct course of action however I am scared of the potential of mounting doctors bills without any genuine diagnosis.  I am very hopeful that someone here may have heard of these symptoms before and may be able to shine any sort of light into my situation and provide some guidance.

I went to urgent care and got four stitches. They wrapped it in gauze, gave me 10 days worth of doxycycline and I went home. When I got home, I had no pain, presumably because of anesthesia.

Brief summary of relevant history:

July 2019 - First instance of noticing blood in my semen. Saw a urologist, who performed a quick exam of my prostate and noticed a minor swelling. Prescribed Levaquin. Finished the dose and issue went away.

June 2021 - Issue returned, saw the same doc and went pretty much the same way, but skipped the prostate check.

October 2021 - Issue returned, saw the same doc and went pretty much the same way as June.

April 2022 - Issue returned, saw the same doc and went pretty much the same way.

July to October 2022 - Sorry I don't remember the exact timeline for the next few things but will do my best. I went back to the doctor because of some recurring testicular discomfort. He did an ultrasound and diagnosed varicose veins in my testicles. The things we tried for that were 1) 2 weeks of meloxicam 7.5mg; 2) Another round of the Levaquin; 3) an injection into my hip of some cocktail of painkillers. 1 &amp; 3 both helped short term. Also in this time I brought up (since I has just learned it myself) that I have possible family history of prostate cancer, just one relative. He did a PSA test and it came back fine. I think he said 1.7 but not 100% I'm remembering that correct.

November 2022 - Blood issue returned, same resolution again.

Now this week I saw blood again and I'm wondering a few things:

Is it okay to just keep going back for the Levaquin to treat since it's working?

Could there be something else causing the infection to return?

Is there a risk that using the Levaquin so many times could lead to some antibiotic resistant bacteria or something? For the record I finished every prescription completely and out of all of them I think I missed a dose once.

I’m having some issues with my bladder, I’ll go to the bathroom and pee a normal amount but my bladder still feels full, just I don’t have the urge to go.

I have no pain when peeing. I can hold my pee a pretty long time, and I saw a pelvic floor pt a few years ago who had told me to squeeze a certain way when I had to pee to help build muscle and reduce urgency to pee. I think it’s just flexing your pelvic floor, whenever I do it the urge to pee goes away quickly and I don’t have to go for little while. So I do that sometimes, but now I rarely have a strong urge to pee. When I do and I go I’m peeing for 30 seconds or more sometimes.

I will also get a really intense pain sometimes, that shoots from my midline under my belly button straight down into my urethra.

FINDINGS: The right submandibular gland is normal in appearance. No stones are identified. The ducts do not appear dilated. There is a 5 mm well-circumscribed hypoechoic structure adjacent to the gland that could be a small cyst. No Doppler flow is identified. A small hypovascular nodule is also possible.

My recent labs have shown that I’m anemic, iron deficient, B12 deficient, my sodium was a little low, my blood sugar was a little high, my Albumin was high, and my BUN and BUN/Cre ratio were low. 

I wear glasses and my current prescription is very recent. 

I get pretty mild double vision most of the time. I look at something and it’s slightly overlapped, but I can make sense of it and go about my day. Sometimes, it’s really bad, and I can’t distinguish exactly where things are. If I close either eye, I can see and navigate as necessary. The biggest issue is when it gets bad and I need to drive, because the lanes start to overlap and it’ll look like someone is driving straight toward me. So I close one eye and can get safely to a destination. 

This used to happen a lot if I had been drinking, but I haven’t had a drink in months.

662,AskDocs,"Hello, I (26M) had a mental break a couple years ago. This breakdown lasted a little over a month because of accumulated stress of over a year that was going on between me and my now partner (broken up at the time but still intimate) . I thought i was losing her and it broke me. For over a month I was completely gone. I didn’t know what I was saying, doing, where i was going and who i was interacting with etc. Looking back on it from the few memories I do have from the time period I was completely voided of all emotions and couldn’t feel anything mentally and psychically. I cannot place myself for this month and only know what happened from a few memories and evidence. I regrettably did risky and hurtful activities that is very hard to talk about. Completely out of character and against my values. I did not seek this out but was able to do it because I couldn’t process what was happening or what I was doing. People said I was acting strange at the time but chalked it up to me being stressed . I also recorded a 10 second video of myself during this time saying something completely out of character that I don’t remember taking. I saw text messages during that time and said things about myself that never even happened. It has plagued my mind for 2 years what happened to me for that month so I finally saw a psychiatrist. I have no history of mental illnesses and nothing before or after has happened since. BP was also ruled out. After talking for a couple sessions with my psychiatrist he said that it sounded like I experienced a psychotic episode. He also said that it’s possible to have a stand alone psychotic episode and not have an ongoing mental illness. The only thing is, I thought he would diagnose me with a dissociative event even though dissociation can come with psychosis. A therapist also said it sounded like a dissociative event when it came to this. I had no hallucinations or delusions. My mind was completely blank looking back.

More details:
Around January I've started having abdominal pain, which I've concluded were due to constipation/irritated intestines as it disappeared after I took laxatives and went to the bathroom. However the pain would come back as soon as I missed a day at the bathroom. The pain is mostly above my navel, and I have this sensation of malaise from my stomach to my chest as if I were going to pass out and vomit at the same time, which I actually never do. All of this were coming and leaving until recently where it started becoming constant.

Lately these have been a constant thing + I have trouble sleeping, I am feeling weak and my whole body hurt.

Sometimes I have acidic reflux too.

Also seems like the amount of noise coming from my stomach has significantly decreased. Typically, I have a lot of stomach noise and gas coming up through my throat for \~2hr after eating; some noise after drinking. This is no longer the case.

I have lost my appetite. I can still eat and drink; I have increased my water intake since this started. Still able to use the bathroom and have bowel movements (no change in frequency). No vomiting.

Been to the gastroenterologist and have no external hemorrhoids,maybe an internal one and a possible fissure but a lot of the discomfort comes after using a bidet and wiping the excess off. 

The  discomfort comes from maybe half an inch inside the rectum to the skin outside of the anus. I have seen inflammation,but the anus looks normal and most days I'm normal more than not

Sometimes while pooping,I have a cracking sensation that leads to discomfort but not always. Have tried suppositories that didn't really help but I feel they weren't working because the issue isn't hemorrhoids

i don't know my weight at the moment, but i'm underweight.

i am British, and i don't smoke or drink, i don't do anything like that, or any other things.

&amp;#x200B;

so basically, i'm gonna try to go into, full detail about everything, so i'm sorry if it's very long but i rather get it off, my chest more than anything right now.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------

so basically, my dad passed away in 2019, from cancer, and i was 10 at the time, i didn't see his death, but i did see his suffering, and struggling to breathe, and seeing him, see people who aren't there, but after his passing, a few months after, i started to get stressed, and i started to deal with online bullying, harassment, fighting, drama, and abuse online. (i understand it may not seem like a big deal, but in general i felt like killing myself at the time, because of it. i don't anymore tho.)

&amp;#x200B;

but i was/am stressed for around 3-4 something years, because of my dad's death, and all the bullying etc, and now i feel weird, and you can, see my other posts on this, because i'm not the best at explaining most things, like this since i have no idea how to explain, the things i feel at the moment, and it's pretty scary, and i'm scared it's serious but, you may look at my other posts, but my feelings have 100% changed since the past few months, but i feel weird again, so i just want some help, on finding out if it's just anxiety, and stress.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry, if this is dumb, or silly it's really not a fun thing to feel, and i feel all alone, with my feelings that are making me, feel weird.",t2_qj5m987t,0,"is this anxiety, and stress, or it is more serious? f14 (please, some help.)",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12n813c,True,Go0Ld1e,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12n813c/is_this_anxiety_and_stress_or_it_is_more_serious/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12n813c/is_this_anxiety_and_stress_or_it_is_more_serious/,474971,1681573259,0,,False,1681573271,1681573272,2023-04-15 15:40:59,,,

33F. I noticed a small red spot on my chest five days ago. Three days ago, it had turned into a larger raised lump that was tender to the touch. It has been draining clear fluid since then, and yesterday finally had some white pus (I know I shouldn't have squeezed at it, but here we are). 

I've had fairly consistent chest acne for 20+ years, but typically once a pimple comes to a head and pops, it goes away quickly and relatively painlessly for me. This has only become more uncomfortable, and the surrounding area (about the size of my hand with fingers spread out) was throbbing enough last night that I had difficulties sleeping. I put a neosporin with  numbing on it yesterday and today, but it hasn't reduced the throbbing or aching feeling.

I am on Mirena IUD, and take multivitamins and B complex vitamins daily. I have previously gone through an 8-month course of Accutane, along with spironolactone, tetracycline, and a good number of tropicals, but am not using anything aside from a la Roche posey salicylic wash and vanicreme sensitive lotion currently.

Any idea what this is, or whether I should wait it out or find a clinic open on weekends?",t2_6ahxqkmb,0,Painful lump on chest,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12n80ph,True,copious-cats,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12n80ph/painful_lump_on_chest/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12n80ph/painful_lump_on_chest/,474971,1681573244,0,,False,1681573262,1681573263,2023-04-15 15:40:44,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=75a0d6b950d65311d884b218ef286bd81a0190a2', 'width': 1859, 'height': 2479}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=796f5b95d238f6cd346bf2231b208bf355c16e8f', 'width': 108, 'height': 144}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8900f6875fc49c532324a24be0fe389b744107fb', 'width': 216, 'height': 288}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd9eb827181cc1ffacff2391eb5d7d803f5de50c', 'width': 320, 'height': 426}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8a04c2a1ef74022acc8139e485ed54accd9aa88e', 'width': 640, 'height': 853}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=73b95564465cf28bb6a9f04e0086931995ec8e5e', 'width': 960, 'height': 1280}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5cC7iQs76ghlCQ_vRbnlxTXrlbljEn28A3A4A0Y-Js0.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb71bad3c895e291944c782339c3601c19747b90', 'width': 1080, 'height': 1440}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '7P8ItafJ-fCSIljMFvXp2kLO6eZ0yRTx-fwD3yCCC7k'}], 'enabled': False}",

Me and my husband are refinishing a cabinet. We don't kno what kind of wood it is. The past 3 days we have been sanding it (without masks). The first 2 days we were hand sanding it, and yesterday (the 3rd day), we were using an electric sander. 

The first day I started to complain about feeling sick, and took a covid test, which was negative. I still felt that way the second day so I took another one, which was also negative. The symptoms then were a cough, fatigue, and body aches.
The symptoms were slightly worse the third day, and there was ALOT more sawdust in the air. (We have been doing this in a room with the door shut, not outside). After doing that, when I blew my nose, it was very dark brown. 

Today I woke up and the symptoms are much much worse. My chest feels heavy and tight, theres a burning sensation in my chest and throat, my cough is much worse.. I have also been neaseous, very fatigued, and having alot of body aches. I have taken another covid test, which was negative again. I also just had covid, about a month ago, and am fully vaccinated.

The nails that are affected are softer, streaky, more brittle. They often get caught in fabric, leaving sharp remains at the edge of my nail. There are white spots and creases on my affected nails. When I cut my nails, the affected nails split into an upper and lower layer. The lower layer is much softer than the upper layer. I’ve seen three dermatologists about this, with no solution. The first one brought a thick textbook in the office, took me to the nail section, and had me review the nail infections. I didn’t find a similar condition, so they told me to see another dermatologist. The second doctor took a sample of my nail, and never got back to me. The third doctor told me it was nothing and it will go away in less than a year.  Could anyone help me here? I’ve uploaded some images of my nails here:

Anyway. quick background. I was anorexic as a teen. I've recovered but have mostly avoided typical ""working out"" as an adult to avoid triggers, I still got exercise, though. I recently started working out for real, and I like it. I eat as healthy as I'm able and still have no appetite sometimes, but I do my best.

I happened to notice in my notes from the doctor it says I'm ""Obese"" highlighted in red, whereas two lines above that... says my BMI is 24.3...

The nurse called me back today and was like, ""well it's almost 25."" Keep in mind; I've even lost 5-10 pounds since my visit; I have runners legs, you can see my ribcage if I suck in, etc.

I hear her to another nurse, ""we classify 25 - 30 as obese, right?"" and then, to me, ""Yeah, we classify obese starting at a BMI of 25, so...""

I basically just snorted a laugh and told her, ""thank you""...

As I said, I used to have an eating disorder, so I know about BMI, and it's not rocket science. Plus, I'm not body dysmorphic. My weight is average, and I look good.

I've already decided, for other reasons, that I won't be going back to this doctor. But can anyone shed light on this? Is 25 BMI now classified as obese? Also, if not, is this worth taking up with them again? I feel like this being on my chart would be confusing to other doctors.

710,AskDocs," I am a 20-year-old female. I have been facing health issues for about a year now. Symptoms include excessive fatigue, low blood pressure, dizziness, frequent fevers, frequent and severe body aches and headaches, and nausea. I have also lost about 15 kg in a short time. My hands and feet tend to stay cold. I struggle with breathing too sometimes, specifically after doing any physical activity. One other odd symptom that I have noticed is frequent urination. And no matter how tired I am, I can never sleep. I have lost my appetite drastically too; I never feel hungry. I have also become very irritable, which is very unlike me. As far as my medical history is concerned, I have dealt with low blood count and iron deficiency anaemia since my childhood. I have also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been dealing with it for quite some time. I got a lot of tests done, but doctors were unable to diagnose anything as there was nothing too alarming in the results. In October 2022, I got a hemogram, vitamin D, and bit b12 test done, which reported that my vitamin D was very low, so I took oral medication for the same. I have tried multiple prescribed medications to help with sleep and hunger, but they have not worked on me. My symptoms persist on a daily basis, but I have noticed that every couple of days, max a fortnight, my symptoms become worse than usual, and I can't handle it. I showed my reports to a haematologist, and when she did a physical examination, she saw big, dark marks all over my back and suspected that it could be an autoimmune disorder and referred me for an ANA-IFA test, which was negative. I fainted and I got a test done for hemogram and vitamin D again yesterday, and the report showed that most of my results (haemoglobin, rbc, lymphocytes, and eosinophils) are towards the lower range or borderline of the parameters. The part that concerned me the most was that my erythtocyte sed rate was very high. When I looked it up on the internet, it showed that it means I have inflammation in my body and that autoimmune has popped up again. I'm sick and tired of feeling this way for almost a year without any diagnosis. I have read that people can go years suffering from autoimmune disorders without getting a diagnosis, and that some people have it even with a negative ANA-IFA test. What should I do next? What disease could it be? Please refer some good doctors in Delhi, India, to diagnose the same and help me out.

Hi all. I’ve been bothered by two close together white lumps atop of my head. I previously thought there was only one (the small one) but it seems a second bigger one has popped up. 

It bleeds at the touch and is super sensitive. I itched at it and it resulted in weeping blood and a clear liquid. I woke up having to pull green crust out of my hair around the impacted area when I woke up in the morning. As a result I can safely rule out that they are pimples.

*Ok, onto the question: did I pick up a parasite?* I got back from Tulum, Mexico on Tuesday and am experiencing a lot of makes changes all at once. 

GI: I’ve been so bloated it looks like I’m pregnant since a day or two into the trip. Not hyperbole, I sent my mom pictures and she is insisting I take a pregnancy test lol (I have an IUD). It has not gone down even as I got home and upped my water intake, upped my fiber then avoided bloating foods for me (beans, lentils, cruciferous veggies). Normally, my bowel movements are super regular and unproblematic - 1-2x/day, easy to pass. Since early in the trip, they’re totally off: frequent but incomplete (4x yesterday), and loose but not watery. Gross, but I noticed a sting-looking thing once after a BM.

Energy: I’ve been unexplainable fatigued since halfway through the trip. I got home and did what usually helps me recharge (no alcohol, 8 hours of sleep per night, alone time) but I’m so tired still. I’ve been drinking double my usual caffeine intake (up to 160 mg) to get through working around people. 

Skin: My skin is suddenly much more textured with more visible pores than normal and I have red patches on the apples of my cheeks that aren’t usually there. My usual texture-resolving topicals are doing absolutely nothing (AHAs, BHAs).  I maintained my usual skincare while traveling and was applying SPF 2-4x/day and wearing a hat.",t2_x3n8n,0,Did I pick up a parasite traveling?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12n6205,True,tiny_al,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12n6205/did_i_pick_up_a_parasite_traveling/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12n6205/did_i_pick_up_a_parasite_traveling/,474960,1681570577,0,,False,1681570589,1681570590,2023-04-15 14:56:17,,,

55F. There was a dirty rag with which he had cleaned the glass shards from a broken bottle. What happened was that without knowing, I took the rag to clean a stain on the floor, which I did with regular force. And after that I began to feel discomfort in various areas in the palms of my hands, such as internal discomfort and pain when certain areas of the palms of my hands come into contact, despite the fact that there is no mark, swelling or bleeding in those areas. And basically at this point, a year after the event, these particles have not been expelled naturally by my body, and I still feel the same, and I try not to use too much force when holding things or coming into contact with the palms of my hand, and I have to sleep with my hands palms up to avoid any contact so it doesn't cause me pain. I am not following any treatment or taking any medicine. I hope I have a recommendation of what I can do about it.

729,AskDocs,"I am a 23 year old male, 350lb, and I have been to dozens of doctors and specialists, and while I've gotten some answers, no medications have been effective for me.

I have never smoked, never taken non-prescription drugs, never drank any alcoholic beverages. 

I am currently being prescribed: 
10mg Cyclobenzaprine for TMJ (and so far has been the *only* medication that has ever worked as intended for me) - 4 months
100mg Desvenlafaxine - 2 months 
100mg Bupropion (will be stopped due to the side effects) - 1 month 
37.5mg Phentrimine (very recently prescribed, for energy and weight loss)


I've been professionally diagnosed with:
Major Depressive Disorder (dxed @ 12, but symptoms since I was 9 or younger)
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (same as with MDD)
Sensory Processing Disorder (dxed @ 16, symptoms my whole life) 
Borderline Personality Disorder (initially dxed @ 16 with Bipolar Disorder; but was then corrected to BPD after I had been hospitalized at 18, symptoms since I was a teen) 
PTSD (dxed @ 20, but symptoms since I was 9) 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (dxed @ 20, symptoms most of my life) 
Sleep Apnea (dxed @ 20, symptoms since a teen) 

I also deal with fairly bad insomnia - I am unable to have a normal sleep schedule, my body just does not let me get to sleep until I stay up long enough to finally crash; and no sleep medication has helped. I've tried melatonin, Benadryl, NyQuil, among other OTC sleep meds, with no effect - even at 2-3x recommended dosage. I've been prescribed various sleep medications, but none have helped aside from Mirtazapine, which worked extremely well for 2 nights, then *completely* lost its effect the subsequent nights.


In a similar vein, I never feel rested when I wake up, and I am always extremely fatigued throughout the day. Even after using a CPAP to treat my sleep apnea, the quality of my sleep and level of fatigue did not change. 


I've seen over half a dozen psychiatrists since I was 15, I've seen a neurologist, I've seen a pulmonologist and had sleep studies done, I've seen an endocrinologist, I've seen multiple therapists, and just nothing has ever helped. 


Ive been on way more medications than I could ever hope to recall, but I've been prescribed dozens of antidepressants of various types, I've been put on mood stabilizers, anxiety meds, antipsychotics, anti-seizure meds (despite not having seizures), as well as numerous ""booster"" meds alongside many of these - the vast majority of all the meds have been taken up to the maximum recommended dosage (several doctors have suggested going beyond that, but insurance thinks they know better than doctors when it comes to prescribing medications, which made that not an option) and yet none have proven effective. I'll experience many of the side effects, just none of the positive effects they were intended to have. 


I had this ""gene-site testing"" done that was meant to show what medications of varying types would be most/least effective based on my genes, and despite going through numerous different medications that were all expected to have ""extremely positive results"", none have been remotely effective. I've had bloodwork done, many, many, many times to test for various other things, and nothing has been found with that. 


I have not been able to function on even a basic level for years.

I’m a 32 year old male, 155 lbs, 6’1” tall don’t drink and quit smoking and started vaping almost 8 years ago, fairly regular marijuana use. The last couples months I’ve had intermittent chest pain which is normally dead center or to the left side but sometimes presents in my right side mid way down rib cage. I’ve had 3 EKGs with 1 being described as abnormal but when it was reviewed by an ER doctor he said it wasn’t abnormal it was prolly because I’m skinny and my body has low impedance. All blood work and X-rays were described as normal. During one episode my heart rate reached 150bpm but began to slow after reaching the ER. I don’t have any history of anxiety and only ever had one heart attack in my family. Could I have developed anxiety at this age? Is this just the invincibility of youth wearing off? I would think nothing of it but sometimes my vision will become a little blurry and I feel disoriented when it happens. I have a PCP appointment next week but am fearful I could have some sort of cardiac event before then, I’ll post all results in the comments. Should I push to have this taken care of sooner? I’ve been to the ER twice and both times heart was fine, once the pain presented while on a 6 lead and it stayed normal through out chest pain. It just doesn’t “feel” like a GI issue and I’ve tried moving and stretching to try to make it better or worse just to try to narrow it down but have been unsuccessful.

742,AskDocs,"I am a 36 year old heterosexual Caucasian male. I’ve been with the same sexual pattern, my wife, 32F caucasian for the past 13 years.  I’ve developed a raw and painful spot on the shaft of my penis just underneath the head.  It’s almost like a sore, red and raw, surrounded by normal skin.  Simultaneously I have a very painful rash around my anus, where my butt cheeks rub together. At the top of my butt crack, above the anus, there is another open sore. It’s relatively itchy and when I blot it with toilet paper there is small specks of blood on the TP.   I’m unsure if these two things are related. There is currently a nasty virus going around in my house (sore throat, wet cough, congestion) and not sure if those are related in any way either.   I’ve never had either of these issues with my penis or butt.  My wife has never had either of these issues as well. 

Additional info - this past Sunday was the last time my wife and I had sexual contact and I was masturbating for some of it.   Unsure if calluses on my hand, etc could have triggered the sore and then it gradually got worse from rubbing on my underwear all week.

750,AskDocs,"**TL,DR**: My father is on 3 medications that cost over $2000 a month on Medicare. Is there any way he can get them cheaper or are there alternative meds he could be switched to that are cheaper? What are his options?

**Full explanation**:

My father doesn't know how to use a computer so I'm posting this for him to try to help save his life. My father is a 72-year-old, white European man with chronic heart failure, kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes, among many other health issues. He lives near Springfield, MA, US, and is on Medicare insurance as he is both disabled and retired. He has been hospitalized several times since November 2022 due to cardiac issues. In his last hospitalization, the doctors told us his heart function was only 15%. They wanted to implant a pacemaker but determined his heart was not strong enough. His kidneys are also not doing well. He is on a bunch of medications and basically has a pharmacy in his room. He was prescribed: Dapagliflozin (Brand name: [Farxiga](https://www.farxiga.com/)), Sacubitril / Valsartan (Brand name: [Entresto](https://www.entresto.com/)), and Sitagliptin (Brand name: [Januvia](https://www.januvia.com/)). Even though he started the medications a few months ago, he still isn't doing well and spends more than half his time in bed so I don't know how much longer he will be around. Unfortunately, even with Medicare covering 75% of the cost, he is still stuck with paying about $1300 USD each month for just those 3 prescriptions and is still paying over $600 a month just for the ""top"" Medicare plan because he has so many doctors and medications. My parents don't have that kind of money to keep paying over $2000 a month just for a few of my dad's medications. My parents combined annual income is probably only $60-70K, maybe even lower now that both parents are retired/disabled. My dad insists he makes too much to be able to apply for those low-income programs that I see for certain meds but I think it's more about shame and him being too stubborn to ask for help. To make it even worse, my mom has cancer for the second time and her medications aren't cheap either. My parents both worked hard their entire lives and I hate to see them spend all their savings on medications. Is there anything my father can do so he can afford his meds? Are there generics or other meds that work similarly and are cheaper? Is there anything that can be done?

MAIN pain/issue: INTENSE searing burning below sternum and intense nausea, shakiness, weakness and fatigue/headaches. Sounds moderate but it literally has made me pass out before. 


It’s worse on an empty stomach/ in the mornings, and the anxiety can be tremendous. Fatigue is also bad.  It makes it hard for me to even have a job, and during it’s worst, i can’t drive (panic/severe pain). Occassional burping. Bad breath (rancid). 

Symptoms:
- burn below sternum leading into stomach sometimes.  
- gets better after food.  worse on empty stomach.  
- occasional burps. Fatigue and major anxiety (working on that)  
- depletion of confidence to drive, travel, have fun, etc  

   
Some history:  
- Healed Erosive esophagitis    
- Burning is every day, worse on empty stomach
- Kratom helps the pain, nothing else does (years with and without it)
- ppi’s dont do shit but apparently helped the erosions heal? maybe? I’ve used highest doses of ALL PPIS
- Doc says i might just have an over active immune issue cuz my esophagus/stomach looks okay  
- i’ve tried every acid reducing fucking thing on this planet (h2 blockers, mylanta/gaviscon (uk and us versions), all kinds of shit.     
- even tried shit like lily of the dessert, trying that again. Pepzin GI also. I do exercise. I do eat a bland ish diet, and i experimented with all kinds of diets to no avail.

Currently trying mastic gum, anti h pylori probiotics and garlic extract. I don’t know what to do, Dr’s seem to prescribe useless antibiotics that dont do anything. Most think I’m fine, and that it’s just my central immune system being weird. 
 
So yeah, docs don’t know… I don’t know… but I’m ready to give up. It’s been over two years.

First I got very very dizzy. The world was spinning very fast. I then started sweating like crazy, I was sweating through my clothes. I felt a lump and numbness in my stomach and throat making me feel I was going to throw up. Then my ears started ringing. Then my legs felt like they were going to give in. I felt like I was going to pass out.

My mum was supporting me so I didn't fall and was leading me to a bench. That's when 2 fucking fire trucks drove past sirens blaring. The noise was deafening and made my ears ringing worse. I sat down and I lost HALF MY FUCKING HEARING in both ears. Still dizzy and disoriented.

This whole thing lasted about a minute but it felt like I lifetime. I was genuinely convinced I was dying. About half and hour later in the car I began tearing up and lost control and started crying for no reason.

I am worried it is herpes but I don’t think it is. I would like to get tested for herpes but I don’t see any blisters in my genital areas so don’t think they will do the test.

 It doesn’t look like a cold sore from the picture either.

I got 5 stitches on the outside of my lip and 2 inside - a couple of the smaller lacerations on the inside were intentionally left unstitched by the ER doc. 


I’ve been taking 875-125 MG twice per day since the day it happened, and icing often, eating carefully. Other than the swelling, it feels OK. No oozing, very minimal pain, no major redness, no bleeding, no throbbing or warmth. Just craaaazy swelling yesterday and today.

DEXA last fall showed low BMD with a Z-score of -2.4 at LS, -1.2 at FN. Very low vitamin D, B12, ferritin when checked last year, now on 50,000 iu vitamin D weekly, IM B12 monthly, iron infusions.

I took about a month off running in Feb/March for MCAT prep then resumed a couple weeks ago - for context, I usually go for longish distances of 9-12 miles 4 or 5 days a week, plus some walking. At first in late March, I just had normal muscle soreness, then mild hip pain toward the end (eg, miles 8-10) of a long run. As of about 3 days ago, I now have ongoing left hip/groin pain, antalgic gait, and pain that persists at rest for hours after a walk or jog, even while supine. I have to take 1300 of Tylenol q8 (so, max daily dose) to get through the day and sleep at night. 

I believe a hop test would be positive, but the pain does dissipate if I'm sitting for a while and not moving around. I'm of 2 minds about whether I need an ortho consult: I think I'm overall low risk, considering my age and relative good health, and I'm worried I'm overthinking this/becoming a hypochondriac, especially because it could just be a strain or impingement or something (made the age-old mistake of looking up differentials in UpToDate and am now terrified of the worst-case outcome, i.e. FN stress fx and 4 weeks on crutches).

At the same time, I'd like to know if it's a condition that's likely to progress with continued high-intensity activity so I know to lower my training load. I think previous stress fractures have scared me a little, but I don't think femoral neck stress fx has a high incidence (in non-elderly pts) relative to the types of stress fractures I've had. 

Is it worth seeing an orthopedic surgeon? Should I wait a while longer to see if it improves on its own?

When talking, I often have to swallow and drink water. It subtly affects the sound of my voice, but the worst part is just how uncomfortable talking is. It’s even worse if I’m singing, rapping, or talking for a long time. I also feel it in my nose a lot, and blowing my nose doesn’t help either.

I went to a specialist, I believe a otolaryngologist, at a hospital who stuck a camera down my throat. This was about two years ago. They didn’t find anything. I’ve mentioned this to my doctor many times, but they never find anything. I’ve tried throat lozenges, gum, etc., but nothing helps. In fact, that seems to just make it worse. I drink lots of water, but that doesn’t help either.

I struggle with anxiety as well, and I’ve been told it may be related to that. However, this is pretty much a constant problem, even if I’m totally alone. If I’m not talking for a long time, I may not notice it, but as soon as I start talking, I do notice it. Some days it’s worse than others.

This doesn't happen if I change the tampon every time before I piss. But I really can't change the tampon every time I pee as I pee very very often and that would dry up my vag. 

My question is, can this cause TSS or other not-so-good complications? Otherwise I find tampons very convenient and wouldn't want to give them up.

I’ll start with the fact that I have really strong sinus arrhythmia with fluctuations between inhales and exhales around 30bpm. When laying down my heart rate is 75+-, however if I’ll do my best to lower it down with exhaling really slow and then holding breath it drops to normal 60, but for a short time, then comes back. When sitting my heart rate is 80-100 which is very high, considering I’m doing sports my whole life and in a decent shape. Again if I try hard I can drop it to 75 for a short time. During the sleep it’s between 48-70. When I’m walking it’s 110-120 and it’s a slow walk. I’ve been to the ER 7 times during last two month because of it and my miserable heart health anxiety, all ECGs, x-rays and blood works were normal, I was also referred for a 24h monitor, which I’m still waiting for. I also feel constant chest tightness which I hope is due to anxiety. 

Btw, I had an echo around 3-4 years ago and it was completely normal, so I think I can assume that my heart is normal structurally. 

What are the chances that this is heart related condition? I’m so scared of going into cardiac arrest any second, I don’t want to die because of my heart.

Basically 16th of Jan everything changed - whilst on a walk I had this cramping / tight pain in my left calf it was causing me to limp and walk with my foot inwards. Since then I haven’t been able to walk properly without any pain / uncomfortableness. Since January I would say there’s little improvement like not limping and the cramping sensation is kinda gone but it still feels tight and stiff with movement, I can no longer walk as fast as I did (I was active) and I can’t walk for a long or even short time. When standing straight legs together on my left leg it feels like pressure around my knee and the back of my calf doesn’t feel like it has the same “structure” as my right, my right feels far more secure. One time in feb I tried to walk and I had the sharpest and tightest pain it was literally sore to touch for about 2 and a half days - I haven’t had that since. I have also been started to get twitches (not very frequent but I never used to get this) on that calf and sometimes a random cramp when sitting form but it’ll only last about 3 seconds. My leg feels less stiff at night. I get no pain when sitting only when using the leg. My right hip has also started to feel stiff and hurt but I’m not sure if it’s bc I’m using it way more however I’ve started to get a water trickling feeling across that glute but that’s on and off and been since October and I was so stressed then so my doctor chalked it up to anxiety. Also my feet have started to go warm at night sometimes one sometimes one or both. There was one time I was walking and my leg felt so heavy and my thigh was hurting me as if I was dragging a heavy weight, my foot was so red as if I was dragging a weight. My little toe has been red for ages too lol. 

My doc said it was anxiety causing this I didn’t despite it at first but this is been so long and it’s literally getting in the way of everything. I’ve paid for tests to rule things out:
- MRI of calf and knee 
- multiple blood tests 
- MRI of lower back 

Everything normal except small bulge at L4/5 but nothing enough to cause pain.

787,AskDocs,"Age: 51

Sex: F

Height: 5'10 1/2""

Weight: 170lbs

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: 3 years

Current  meds: Flovent 220mgh 2 puffs twice a day, proair rescue inhalor as  needed, hardly ever used, zyrtec 10mg daily for allergies

Previous medical conditions:

As  a child had severe allergies (environmental and seasonal) and asthma,  also dealt regularly (every 2-3 months) with bronchitis or pnemonia, so a  lot of chest xrays and antibiotics. When I got sick, I got really sick,  it would take me a long time to get better. In middle school I started  having the availability of steroid inhalers, and then middle school  through high school got allergy shots which both helped tremendously.  End of HS through college and early adult years were healthy. Had 2  pregnancies with 3 children (twins). Then at age 40 (2014) diagnosed  with invasive breast cancer. Had lumpectomy with radiation to left side.  Then in 2016 diagnosed with invasive breast cancer on right side, again  lumpectomy and radiation to right side. In 2018 precancer with  lumpectomy only. Finally in 2020 invasive breast cancer resulting in  bilateral mastectomy. Never had chemo. Tried tamoxifen and lupron, each  briefly, but could not tolerate the severe hot flashes and joint pain.

January,  2021 started having ""episodes"" of feeling ill that come on very  quickly, within 1 hour. When they happen I feel very achy all over with  severe joint and muscle pain, extreme fatigue, feeling cold like I have a  fever, but either my temp is low grade fever, or very low (95-96  degrees), and chest inflammation. My chest feels heavy, increased  respirations and O2 sats drop to high 80's to low 90's. Over a few days  it goes away, until it happens again.

Having  been sick so much when I was younger as well as having asthma attacks, I  know what each of these feel like, and this is not either of these.  Sometimes the episode is tolerable and I just muttle through it, other  times I feel so awful I have to be in bed for a day or two. I take  motrin and/or tylenol, mucinex, rescue inhalor and up my steroid  inhaler, nothing works. When I am feeling very ill I have the foggy head  feeling like when you have a bad cold or flu, but I never have any  nasal congestion. Usually gets better in 2-3 days. Then will return in 2  weeks to 2 months. The last 2 weeks I had 3 ""episodes"" and I am just  sick and tired of feeling sick and tired!!

Of  note, I had never had any urinary issues, never had a UTI, vaginitis,  bladder infection, nothing. Last September I realized my urine was  really dark (strong tea colored) and cloudy. Went to see NP, UA found to  be cloudy, sp. gravity was &lt;=1.005, trace blood, leukocytes were  large, microscopic results showed WBC 10-25, epithelial cells 2-9 and  bacteria 30-100. They diagnosed me with a UTI and treated with  antibiotics. Has been better but still have occasional episodes of urine  being cloudy or more concentrated. Looking back, it appears that I have  had since 2/22 large amounts of leukocyte esterase, and low specific  gravity, never any protein. Have no idea if this is related...

For  a long time any time my body is battling anything, either illness or  otherwise (surgery, severe stress) I get a rash. It is flat blotchy rash  that the severity depends on the level of perceived stress, so if I am  just feeling lousy it is just on my neck and chest, or if I am really  sick or after my mastectomy 24 hours later I had the rash from my neck  down to my knees covering all my skin. Lasts a few days, not itchy while  I have it, but a few days afterwards I am itchy.

Also  in between these illness ""episodes"" I can have scattered red dots on my  skin, approx 3-5mm, flat, on lower legs and arms. They last a few days  then go away, no pain or itchiness.

Have  seen my oncologist, rheumatology and pulmonology. Everyone is stumped.  The pulmonologist suggested a secondary adult onset of mitochondrial  disease due to two rounds of radiation so I have an upcoming appointment  with a neurologist. The thing that makes me think it is not is that in  between these episodes I feel totally fine.

I  came across a diagnosis of Microscopic Polyangitis, but looking through  my bloodwork I have already had a ANA and a ANCA test and both were  negative. Could it still be that even though that is negative?

I  have had chest CT scans and PET scans, all negative except the mention  that I had bone marrow expansion. The radiologist dismissed it as  post  chemo, but I have never had chemo so not sure why that would be. They  also saw a lung nodule they were watching but that has been found to be  benign.

I have many lab tests, all  wnls or negative. They tested me for lupus, IgG, IgA and IgM issues,  lyme, ferritin, complement c3 and c4, double strand DNA antibodies,  C-reactive protein, ESR, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, beta-2  glycoprotein, thyroid, rhematoid, babesia, ehrlichia antibody panel, CBC  and CMP all ok.

So very grateful for any insight or direction with this!

About a week ago I started getting pain in my armpit/trapezoid area of under my left arm. It felt like a muscle pull at first and I thought nothing of it, as I go to the gym and thought I had tweaked it. It persisted though and started making sleeping on that side extremely uncomfortable, and was sore whenever my arm rubbed against my chest or I would touch it.

Then a few days ago I then started getting red bumps appear in my left armpit. I never get spots there, it feels sore and tender to touch. I haven't changed clothes, toiletries, washing powder etc. I've been trying to book a GP appt for the past few days, but they immediately disappear at 8:05am (5 minutes after becoming available at the start of every day) and I've not been able to snag one. I now also have red bumps on my upper left pectoral area near the armpit which have emerged in the past day, and I'm now 100% sure it's all linked. I'm just wondering if I should ring 111 (non-emergency UK number) or go to A&amp;E, or just stick it out and keep trying the GP?

796,AskDocs,"I was adopted as an infant and I recently found out the identity of my biological father.  I have no contact with his family and frankly, for now, that is not something  I want.

Still, my curiosity lead me to seek more informations about him, and what I found left me with a lot of questions about his health, and eventually mine.

He was obviously very ill for a long time, and he died at 40 years old. I have seen a few pictures of him ranging from his 20's to his final years,  and he seemed to be ill on everyone of them.  

On the earlier pictures, in his 20's, the main sign of illness is his extreme thinness and his overall weak and ""unhappy"" look. He was of average height, but almost skeletal. On the few pictures nearing his death, he has a very apparent skin condition on his face, and it seems to be present for many months, maybe many years.

His skin was covered with a lot of similar looking, small red lesions.  It looked  like a very intense case of chicken pox.

I don't have many more informations, but he seemed to have been able to live a relatively normal life, despite his poor health.  I saw a picture of him driving, and smoking a cigarette, and he was obviously able to conceive a child.

What I saw of him was quite saddening, and eventhough I'm healthy,  I now wonder if I'm carrying the gene of  an unknkwon and serious illness.

I realise that it is nearly impossible to identify an illness from the very few informations I'm able to provide, but I'm taking a chance in case, I could have some hints.

Around 2 months ago one night my right leg hurt weird way, especially when I was laying down (when leg was touching the bed), so it was difficult for me to find comfortable position to sleep. And I started worrying that maybe it's DVT, because 2 years ago, after taking birth control pills (yasmine), I also had leg pain and high D-dimer (1300), but a blood clot wasn't diagnosed at that time. Since that time my right leg feels weird from time to time, even now.  Now I am taking POP (Slynd), which my doctor said is safe for me. Anyway, that night I barely slept because of being scared that I might have DVT. Next morning pain was gone, but my heart started beating too fast (around 100-110bpm) and too strongly (visible pulse on neck, strong feeling of my heartbeat in my body). Also strangely, mu pulse was slower when breathing IN, and faster when breathing OUT. At that time I thought it's because of anxiety. But symptoms didn't go away so I went to doctor, he did EKG (no abnormalities there), he said its probably stress and gave me propranolol. I also got referral to cardiologist (appontment in may). I had echo and also no abnormalities there) I also checked D-dimer levels around week (or 2, i don't remember) after onset of symptoms and it was within normal range. Some while after taking propranolol I started experiencing mild pain under my left breast on exertion. I got scared that maybe that's because of propranolol so I stopped taking it. After stopping propranolol pain subsided and heart was beating kinda fast again. But now (since around 2 weeks) I don't have tachycardia anymore, and my pulse is again faster when breathing in, slower when breathing out. But that mild pain under my left breast (on exertion) came back. Now I am wondering, could i have had pulmonary embolism (mostly because of that pulse which was slower when breathing in - i read it's sign of pulmonary embolism, and because of that weird feeling in my leg, also that pain under left breast.). Or was it just my health anxiety... I didn't and don't have shortness of breath or cough. Also my D-dimer was normal (but I read it can be normal few days after forming blood clot and I  checked that around week/2 after onset of symptoms)... Do you think it's possible that it was a pulmonary embolism?? Can I wait with that until my cardiologist appointment (may) or should I go to GP again??

Hello,
Recently my vision has been blurry in my left eye and I would like to see an optometrist soon, but since I live in a different than my home country I thought I'll just ask here to see what people think and if they have any experiences such as mine. During winter I went through a recurring case of pink eye, it was most likely because of the fact that I wear lenses, I had pink eye in both eyes at different points of the season. I used some eye ointments which gradually made this better and I also started to take more care of my eyes and be really careful with how I use lenses too. When I had signs of eye strain I would restrain from using lenses for three days at least. What baffles me the most is that one day I would have my vision blurry in left eye, the other in the right. I don't think the lenses itself are faulty because I exchanged those, although it might be the case that I need a different curvature. At least it seems to me that my eye curvature could temporarily change. I didn't get many days with this until recently again. Yesterday I was crafting some furniture with my flatmate and it made it really difficult for me to measure things, but just half an hour after we were finished my sight was suddenly clear in both eyes. It's not easiest to function like this as you might imagine, I'm only glad I do not have to operate any vehicle or device these days. Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this problem?

814,AskDocs,"My dad was a pretty severe alcoholic and a smoker since he was young. 
He was diagnosed with Stage four throat cancer when he was 48. 
I believe he had it at 45, but didn’t go to the doctor at that time. 
at 48, he had a large tumor that severely impacted his breathing and ended up getting a trach, and then a PEG tube. 

He completed radiation and chemotherapy, had a biopsy and was considered to be “cancer free”, but he still had the tumor in his throat that made his quality of life very low (not able to eat, and couldn’t taste bc of chemo and radiation) He was supposed to get the tumor removed, but the county hospitals weren’t working very quickly. 

I couldn’t be around him a lot so i’m unsure what a lot of the last month of his life was like due to COVID. 

he did continue to smoke. throughout this experience.

he ended up dying because of double pneumonia, total organ failure, and sepsis. 

the day he left for the hospital when he died, i was informed that someone bought him a bottle because he asked, and my understanding is he put the bottle into his PEG. 

I know there are many different factors here that went towards him dying at 49. 
i know the pneumonia was probably due to him sitting stationary and continuing to smoke when he’s weak and went through chemo and radiation. 

but how did the sepsis and total organ failure happen? was it due to him putting the vodka into the PEG? Or was this a ongoing thing? 

It seems that he purposely tried to kill himself with this action. I’m trying to get a better understanding of what happened. (Doctors weren’t very helpful with the explanation of how something like this could have happened at the time, but it was 2020 and i wasn’t allowed to physically be at the hospital at the time)

Female, 32y/o, 235lb, medications are nexium, synthroid, and metoprolol for SVT. 

I've been a nightly drinker (about 8oz/night) for 5 years. 

I had some bloodwork done the other day, and my electrolyte balance was a 4, which was flagged as low. Dr wanted to repeat BW, which was done 2 days later.

BW now shows electrolyte balance is normal, but creatinine is high. 

I know I have to ditch the sauce, but my Dr won't be in until mid-next week, and the anxiety is going to kill me all weekend. 

What would cause these things?

830,AskDocs,"I’m 40, athletic, don’t drink or smoke and live 90% on a low FODMAPs diet. 

A few years ago I was put on pregabalin for pain that should have, and was finally resolved after 4 years through surgery. (Fissure)

When I took the pregabalin (4 weeks) it caused gastritis .. coming off the pregabalin I waited for it to settle. It didn’t. I ended up in bed for 5 weeks unable to function and wishing I would just pass away in my sleep (dramatic I know, but it was horrendous). I ended up in A&amp;E because I couldn’t stand or function. Hobble dizzy spells, weird body draining zaps, reflux, etc. 

I was told to take prochlorperazine for the dizziness and Omeprazole 40mg for the gastritis, the first for two weeks the second for a month. Eventually I moved to a new doctors surgery and they also put me on duloxetine for the pain and to help with my mental state after having been convinced I was never getting better. I did get better, very, very slowly, it took months to feel well again, but I was able to get out of bed and build myself back into my life. Even coming off the omeprazole was hard, with the omeprazole it’s self causing me groin pains (from what a dietician told me was ingredients in the pills and my IBS)

I think it was a mixture of gastritis (diagnosed by endoscopy) and withdrawal from the pregabalin, doctors say no, they said it was anxiety 🤷‍♂️.. so I’ve put it down to the gastritis and focused on that.

I took the duloxetine until my operation and then I started to carefully come off it, considering the risk of withdrawal I did it over 6 months and even then felt pretty rough (buzzing head, sick, etc) and during the first week after stopping, these gastric symptoms started (waking up with pains in my lower back and sides) and rather than risk returning to the place I was, I jumped straight into find the best gastroenterologist I could find who did all the usual tests, samples and cameras.

I have IBS, I’ve always had IBS, I know what my IBS feels like, but just like when I had the gastritis caused by the pregabalin, no one is listening to me. When I stopped the duloxetine .. these symptoms started and they are getting worse. 

My mental health has been excellent now for over a year, but in the last few weeks, this bloating, pain and inability to get help is pushing me back down. Next I’m worried the body zaps and horrible dizzy spells will come back, last time I even had an MRI with a Neurologist because no one made the connection between my symptoms and my gastrointestinal condition.

For some reason, and it may well be that I’m oversensitive and weak, but for some reason, when my stomach is like this my body goes crazy … if coming off the duloxetine messed with the serotonin levels making my guts go crazy and I just have to wait then I’d manage, but it’s the total lack of diagnosis that makes it harder to cope with!

Is it simply a waiting game for the serotonin to return to normal? I know it’s not balanced yet as I’m still getting (best way I can describe it) over sensitivity when it comes to sex, I didn’t get any sexual side effects from the duloxetine but it’s like it’s too sensitive now 🤷‍♂️ or do I need treatment.

I’ve moved from 20mg omeprazole to 15mg lansoprazole to try and mitigate the side effects I seem to get from the omeprazole, the feeling like I need to wee when I don’t but caused by surrounding pressure (if that makes sense). I do have headaches and feel nauseous but I can cope with that. Been a few days and the side effects are less but present. I do seem to feel better overall on the ppis rather than not, but I have no idea how long to take them, or if I’m doing the right thing?!?

I’m hoping someone can help with unusual symptoms that have been going on for two months. 
 
In February this year, I felt like I caught a cold or something at my new job. I felt tired and just crappy. By the end of the week I started feeling feverish (but never have a fever; then or now). I have this sensation on the back of my head like a headache or burning. My head, neck, ears, back of shoulders, arms and hands feel like the skin is burning. I sweat from under my arms and my hands get cold, but this only happens in the morning. Ears feel clogged. My lower throat is burning and so is my chest. A cough started a week ago. The last three weeks, I have been coughing up green phlegm. The phlegm was incredibly dark green and slowly have become lighter green and it is less quantity. I was put on a 7-day course of Augmentin. I still have symptoms and now I am current on a 5-day course of Azithromycin and will finish it this coming week. I have a script to get an x-ray too, but that was given to me yesterday and I couldn’t get it done. Also, I have taken many covid tests since this started 2 months ago, never had a positive result
 
In March, I went to the ER because the “headache” was unbearable and I complained of the fever feeling, again no fever. They did blood work and a head CT (w/o contrast). The CT was normal, and no issues were discovered. The blood work was ok, but my WBC was elevated to 14.8. The doc said it wasn’t concerning because the differential was fine. The next week I went for my yearly blood work (this was scheduled prior to all this). This time the WBC was 8.2, but I still am experiencing these issues.  Bloods were really good otherwise except Vitamin D was low (25 ng/mL). I have been struggling with low vitamin d for a year. Last doc only had me supplement with 1000 iu a day and I have not felt well on this supplement ever. This doctor ordered a mega dose of 50,000 of D2 a week. I have not started it yet and have been taking 5000iu of D3. Most of this started about the time I started taking vitamin d3 again in February

838,AskDocs,"Summary: looking for a sort of second opinion. I think my pain can be worsen by my worrying I have something wrong with me. I have Pelvic pain that could be from a myriad of small things, but it’s bothering me more than most of those small things have ever bothered me.

Female, 29
10 months postpartum (twins)
5’6”, 160-170 lbs ballpark

On Mini-pill progesterone 
Combo feeding breast/formula (but for twins, so I don’t know how that evens out.)
Last period was in September, I think. It’s been a while

Relevant History:
- infertility (had successful iui eventually) 
- endometriosis stage 2 (had laparoscopy that burned out lesions.)
- small fibroid- the shallow type. Subserous? (Removed.)
- polyps (removed.)
- (all this done in 2021 before pregnancy)

- Pelvic Floor tightness issues (went to therapy).
-Fibromyalgia
- Frequent Yeast Infections and BVs
- might have some undiagnosed anxiety (not sure where I’m at compared the average person.)
—-

So, I’m 10 months postpartum. And a couple of months ago I started feeling some pelvic heaviness/discomfort. I would bend over while sitting, (to help babies), and I would feel like something was up internally. 
Idk how else to describe this, but it feels like that feeling when you’re full, and bending over kind of hurts. But it was lower. (I wasn’t full, nor did I need to use the restroom.) It also almost feels like I need to start my period, but I haven’t had one 
Then, I got a yeast infection, and I sort of had some more burning/discomfort. Got fluconazole, and got a urine test just in case. It came back clean. 
I tell this all to my new OBGYN. She orders me an ultrasound, because I’ve had a fibroid before. Ultrasound came back perfect. I also find out my endometrium is thin (thanks to birth control) and I’m not pregnant, which was a worry. (It felt a little like early pregnancy.) 
I had a urine test that came back clean, except for traces of blood. But the culture showed nothing growing.
She ordered me more pelvic floor therapy. (Will start that later.) She also noticed that my yeast infection was still there, so I got 3 more doses of diflucan. 

My digestion has also been varying degrees of uncomfortable these past couple of months. But it’s not seemingly based on the food I eat. My problem is discomfort over the mechanics more than the chemistry, if that makes sense. Lol. I sometimes get loose stool, but recently my stool has been looking so healthy according to what I’ve googled, haha. But I’ve had to lay down after because of pelvic discomfort. 

Again, I’m going to pelvic floor physical therapy in a month. And I have a new pcp that I’ll see in 2 1/2 months. But, waiting for that long to see if something helps has got me a little worried. Especially that I’ve had my fair share of Pelvic Floor issues, and this feels a little different this time. (I went before for painful sex, and “problems emptying bladder”, but I haven’t had all these symptoms before, and I don’t even have problems with painful sex anymore.)

Could my endometriosis be back and causing havoc without my period being back? 
Or is this just a new flavor of Pelvic Floor disfunction? 

I know doctors here can only answer theoretically, but that’s what I’m looking for. If you say you’d do everything the same as my doctor, that gives me comfort. If you say I should look up something, that would give me something to put my energy into besides just wondering what exactly is wrong. 
Again, I think my pain and discomfort is worsened by the thought that this could be something worse than I’m being treated for. (That just comes from my anxiety from family and friends’ sicknesses. They all started with “something doesn’t feel right.”)

841,AskDocs,"(22F) I’ve had this issue since middle school but it got worse in high school. Everyone tells me that it sounds like I have heartburn but more severe. I also get told that it might not just be a heartburn. 

- My belly bloats and I hiccup after every meal without fail which causes me discomfort and after that my stomach gets very audible digestion sounds to the point I get anxiety because of it.
- When it makes those loud sounds, I can physically feel it and it hurts.
- It feels like there’s a lump of air in my throat and I get chest pain. 
- I get heartburn every two weeks or so but any longer period of time I would get a heartburn episode that pains me even more. 
- During the worst episodes it gets hard to breathe. I feel dizzy, with cold sweat, I’m shaking and get super nauseous but I don’t throw up. 
- Usually with heartburn, I was told that laying down makes it worse, but for me I found that it is the most comfortable position and is the only way to relieve pain besides drinking hot water.
- I heard that ginger relieves stomach pain and my mom would make me a hot ginger tea but it doesn’t do anything, it might actually make me feel worse.
- Currently on no medication.
- I’ve tried tums that supposedly work immediately but does nothing. 
- I remember I was prescribed pantoprazole at one point which made it worse, I bloat way more and makes me feel nauseous. I had a couple more medications but I forget their names but none helped anyway.
- I went to many gastroenterologists but they could never conclude anything since I am a busy college student and I jump from my college state to home state. 
- A doctor suggested that I might have a mild version of Crohn’s disease?
- I was able to test for colonoscopy and endoscopy there in which they found several mini ulcers. They wanted a follow up CT scan but I didn’t have time for that and had to go back home.

Currently at my home state and taking a gap year so I wanted to use this opportunity to finally figure out my stomach issues.
I told all my symptoms and results of the tests and medication that I did previously to my current new gastroenterologist. I told him about the mini ulcers and the other specialist to maybe having a mild Crohn’s disease. I forget what he says here exactly but basically he dismisses the idea? Then he suggests that I bring a stool sample to check if I really have other stomach issues or if I get stressed easily and am hypersensitive which triggers the pain. 

I am baffled by this quite honestly. How does hiccuping after every meal and having this issue for years sound like just being stressed?
 
Sorry that was long. I just would like to know what is that I might have.

I haven't had acne or any changes in how my body looks that are supposed to happen during puberty and that I see in my classmates. I guess the only thing that could point to puberty is some small hairs that have started growing here and there, but not a whole lot. I'd say tanner stage II-III ish? It's the only thing that seems to be progressing as it should. I'm 4'11 ish or around 150cm and basically haven't grown at all in the past 2 years.

So basically I have a bit of swelling around my foreskin on the left side whenever I pull my foreskin back, otherwise it isn’t noticeable. Whenever I am erect the swelling gets bigger and is more noticeable and whenever I masturbate it is also more noticeable and swollen which doesn’t surprise me. For context I do masturbate a lot and a few weeks ago when I was masturbating I felt a bit of a niggle in the same spot that is now giving me bother, it then swole quite quickly on that occasion and since I’ve noticed this problem. The swelling feels kind of like a line along my foreskin and is a bit bumpy but it is not currently sore or tender to touch. I’m hoping that this swelling is being caused because of this but I just wanted to try and rule out the big C before going to my doctor but I was thinking it is less likely to be the big C as mine changes in size where I assumed lumps generally stay the same or only increase.

Microcytosis via thalassemia minor.
Have a history of easy bruising that comes and goes.  Recently woke up with large Petechiae rash on upper thigh.  Doctor said I probably scratched myself in sleep.  Since then have been inspecting self and found more sporadic Petechiae onipper thighs, abdomen, chest, upper arms.  Checked CBCs everything is stable.  Platelets range from low to mid normal, most recently tested mid normal, but giant platelets found.  Never had this before. I also get random low grade fevers.  Are giant platelets normal?  Could this affect my platelet count?  Wondering if I should go back to doctor, get second opinion, or if this sounds normal.

Blood in urine last 2+ weeks

45 Male, USA, average built, no medical history, except I have an Inguinal Hernia since last 10 years.

The inguinal hernia has always been manageable, it easily retraced back when I lie down. However recently about 2 months back it got a little bigger and got descended into scrotum. Now also it retraces back but I have to now manually push it a little when I lie down.

About 2 weeks back I started noticing darker urine, and occasional 1 or 2 red mustard size small blood flakes along with urine.

Urine routine test, Urine culture , Urine cytology, Renal profile tests Abdo-Pelvis ultrasound, Abdo-Pelvis CT scan, all came back negative.

Only Urine routine shows RBC in the range of 80-100 / hpf but no bacterial infection was found in urine routine or culture test. Even then I took a 5 day antibiotic course just for precaution.

Since last 2/3 days I am noticing if I am well hydrated and not moving around much, the color of the urine looks normal yellowish with very rarely even smaller 1 or 2 red blood flake. If I go for a 30 mins walk or do some similar activity, the color again changes to brown / pink (I suspect the blood is getting mixed and is changing the color again). So if I taking rest the color of the urine remains normal but with activity it again gets mixed with blood and color changes.

852,AskDocs,"I am a 32yo male, generally healthy. I have had hemorrhoids for the last 6 or so years which have become very severe in the last 3 years.

During bad periods, they are not at all manageable and cause severe pain and heavy bleeding. Through the years I have tried all over-the-counter treatents and am vigilant with my diet and toilet habits.

Because of the problems, I cancelled a long-term goal of cycling around the world whilst I wait to receive treatment.

Since then, I have had one round of banding which has improved things considerably. They are still present and I'm worried they could flare up again. I am extremely careful however I worry that on a long-term bike trip I could experience problems if I got food poisoning or became very constipated. 

I had planned to wait to have a hemorrhoidectomy and then leave for the cycle trip, however, doctors in the UK seem reluctant on the surgery and have warned of the pain/recovery time/complications. I know that for any treatment I would need to continue to monitor diet and generally avoid constipation. 

My question is, would it be sensible to try and get a hemorrhoidectomy as a longer-term solution? Should I try and persue less intensive treatments?

853,AskDocs,"Hello, just wondering if anyone can give advice/ put my mind at rest until I contact my GP next week. It’s going to be a long post so bear with me.
To be honest I don’t know where to start with this🙈First of all I’m Female, 38 years old. 
No major health issues. Have low ferritin so I’m medicated and I had an endoscopy about 9 years ago where a small hiatal hernia was found although didn’t really have any issues with that.
Referred to Gynaecologist about 18 months ago as I was getting low right sided abdominal pain ( have had this for years)plus on internal examination GP found my Cervix to be “ bulky” and small cervical erosion ( which absolutely terrified me!) anyway the Gynaecologist said that all looks fine, my smear came back normal and ultrasound was fine. Said it likely to be ovulation pain! 

So for the past week or so I have been having some abdominal discomfort. It started off in my low right abdomen again, felt like a pulling/ crampy period pain. Anyway that sort of disappeared but then manifested in upper abdomen. Now I do get upper abdominal pain from time to time, but it’s always before my period and at times it actual feels like a period pain! I felt a bit nauseous too. I noticed discomfort when lying down to sleep, it was like all my tummy muscles were pulled/ sore particularly if I slept on my right hand side. Anyway, this sort of disappeared but it’s came back again yesterday, after a bowel movement. 
No issues with bowel movements except they have been more loose. I do think that might be due to what I have been eating and caffeine intake. No weight loss or appetite changes.
Thought it might be good to note that a few weeks ago I had Impetigo and was out on strong antibiotic. This all over pain has only occurred since then.
I had bloods done few month back including thyroid as I am experiencing some hyper symptoms but that was apparently normal ( not as tired as I was, racing heart, anxious, nausea,sudden spots, aching, feeling hot, frequent urination, etc)
Here’s some of my other symptoms!
* weird upper abdominal pain like a burning or period pain feeling.
*lower right abdominal and groin pain.
* periods have gotten heavier last few years.
* awful cramping pain in both bottom and vagina at same time.
* awful PMS symptoms.
* Acne/ skin rashes 
* frequent urination especially ovulation and before period
* loose stools around ovulation and period
Probably lots more symptoms but these are main ones, so I’m puzzled as to if it could be a reproductive problem, digestive issues or brought on my antibiotics or an issue like thyroid? Today it’s back and is shifting low right side to all over particularly under ribs both sides. So scared it’s something sinister.

863,AskDocs,"Hi all, 

I'm a 30 year old non-binary person living in the UK. I was assigned male at birth and have grown up male. I'm currently waiting for a baseline blood test before I start estrogen monotherapy via patches for transfeminising hormone therapy. I've been gender-nonconforming/fluid/queer for a long time and am out and happy about it. I have mild dysphoria about body hair, and I want to transition to female hormones for 1 to 2 years minimum and experience the changes it will have on my emotions, cognition, and body. 

I was diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder / Communication Disorder at age 2. I was on Ritalin at some point until maybe age 8? Then I stopped medicating and had to develop coping and masking strategies. I've been very successful academically and am now doing a PhD, but I'm dependent on my calendar and todo lists and other external systems to handle my neurodivergence.

My partner and friends have noticed I am severely socially inattentive. We can have a conversation and I won't remember it later that day. Sometimes within minutes I will forget something. My sense of time is terrible and I struggle to remember what I did yesterday, or to put events in sequence. Despite this I am very effective at work and research, but it's harming my relationships.

I'm thinking I would like to try medication for my ADHD now to see if it can improve my inattentiveness. But I'm not sure it would be good for me to start estrogen at the same time. So now I don't know if I should go on E first for 3-6 months, then talk to my GP about ADHD meds, or go on ADHD meds and delay my hormonal transition for however long it takes to titrate on that.

I've read that estrogen will affect dopamine production and reuptake but I'm struggling to find academic literature and even anecdotal evidence on Reddit about people in my position. Ideally I'd hope that going on E would also help with my ADHD symptoms, but it seems like it could go better or worse or no change, depending on how well I absorb the E, how well my T is supressed, and the specific issues of my ADHD with respect to brain structure changes and dopamine reuptake. 

I'm thinking maybe I should have a consultation with a private specialist doctor in UK with experience with trans ADHD patients but I don't know how I would find such a person or what the ideal specialisation is to look for. Maybe a neuropsychiatrist with experience with trans patients? Or an endocrinologist with experience with ADHD patients?

So if anyone could provide more information on the effects of MTF hormonal transition in adults with unmedicated ADHD, that would be extremely useful!

MRI showed frontal bilateral migraines. MRA was normal. However, my head is tender. Laying on a pillow makes my headache flair. I also had weird pain in the left leg, like the circulation is poor. Doc said it was muscular, even though there was no pain in the muscle when examining. Now I have a slight pain in my caratoid artery. I have fibromyalgia. Can this cause some type of inflammation in my veins? One of my worst headaches, it felt like the left side of my face, eye, and teeth hurt. Throbbing pain. I've also had 3 ocular disturbances, 2 left, 1 right. Just putting my puzzle pieces out here to see if someone else can figure it out. I've had silent migraines for years, maybe 1 or 2  a year with ocular fields only. No pain, ever. I really don't feel like this is the same, since my MRI looks the same as two years ago.

Pain is primarily top front of the head both sides. Sometimes one, sometimes in the ears, sometimes the bones above the eye, sometimes the temples. Ranging from a 3 to a 9. 9 being the one described above. They lay till I'm exhausted and sleep. Being less painful in the morning. Triptants, Tylenol or anti-inflammatory meds don't touch any headache. I drink one coffee a day. Tried cutting out coffee, didn't help. Drinking more makes the pressure worse. Cold shower or ice is the only thing to take the edge off. Sometimes ice doesn't help either.

877,AskDocs,"Hello, i have a few questions about testing to make sure my brain isnt dying or something.. I have been having pain on the top of my head and side on the right for over a year. A few months ago i went to the er because of a panic attack.. (i guess?) and they did a CT scan on my head. It was clear. But i still have weird symptoms. Ive been having unexplained anxiety and panic attacks since 2021.  Weird adrenaline rushes (idek how to explain) sometimes my body will jerk when i feel uncomfortable in my head and i start breathing hard and my heart will race for a bit. also a random sinking feeling in my body that i get for no reason that makes my heart race for a few minutes. Feeling like im falling sometimes when im standing up. that stuff started in 2021. I started blinking my eyes and raising my eyebrows rapidly in september 2022. Things like that make me feel like im dying, and i cant live like this anymore.  This entire time i thought i had a tumor. I was happy and disappointed when i found out i didnt, Like what do i have to do to feel normal again. What is even wrong with me. I just wish i knew so i could treat it. My mental health has been declining since february wich makes me get the feeling that im dying even more.

But anyways, im seeing a nurse practitioner soon, im hoping she can refer me to a neurologist. (can a NP even refer me to one?) My mom recently saw her and loved her so she wants me to see her too, to get with a psychiatrist. My mental health has been 100X worse since the er panic attack day. But *i* want to go to get with a neurologist.

Now, im guessing if i see a neurologist for my head pain, i will get an mri done right? Can a mri find multiple things at once? Like.. im not sure how it works.. but if i get a mri for head pain, could they also see if my brain is dying or not?

878,AskDocs,"So first I’ll tell you what I’ve told all the medical professionals I’ve talked to thus far.   


This started at the beginning of march. At first I thought it was acne, it was just a few red bumps on my legs. Look exactly like pimples. I bought an acne soap and ointment since I don’t have any acne products for body. Both are sulfur. The pimples did not go away, there were more and it started itching. This is when I realized it wasn’t acne but I thought it would just go away after s while. But it just got worse. Theres so many individual bumps close to each other they formed into big spots. And it’s insanely itchy, literally the most intense itch I’ve ever experienced. Not really itchy during the day but so bad at night I haven’t been getting sleep. I have noticed that the acne treatments while not making the rash better, did significantly help the itching.  


First mf 

Tokd me it was most likely pityriosis rosea and prescribed a steroid cream. I looked that up and no idea why she said that was most likely because it doesn’t line up with what I said at all. She told me to come back if it gets worse. It got worse. I did more research to see what I could find and what seems to me to line up the most is some sort of mites. So I started suspecting that.   


Second mf

Says that it’s probably a fungal infection since it got worse after starting the steroids. She asked me if I see bugs around and I said no because I don’t get a lot of bugs here. This made me concerned because bugs arent always visable and mites and stuff fit in that.   


Third mf

Said the rosea diagnosis was a long shot but has no idea what it is and tells me to go to a dermatologist and get scraped. I brought up bugs and she said it doesn’t look like bug bites. No crap. Though she did listen when I told her about the itching and prescribed medication for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently waiting on dermatology appointment. I’ve found little moving black dots on my legs. One peticular spot was burning and itching so I pulled out a macro lense. It was moving! So yeah I’m pretty sure these are bugs. But what and what can I do about them currently?

For the past several years I have developed the rigorous habit of cleaning my ears with q-tips. Typically, I would use more than 5 q-tips a day to clean my ears dry. I have always been careful not to go too far in so as to touch the eardrum, but I do go as far as I can before getting there. I also apply a lot of pressure to the sides of my ear canal to scratch them, sometimes so much as to cause the skin to break and bleed lightly. I even sometimes use smooth metal objects to lightly scratch the inside of my ears (which feels really good) or to scoop out earwax.

I have also begun to suffer symptoms of tinnitus - although I believe this is likely due to regular exposure to gunshots (military). There has been one incident where a rifle was fired about 5 meters beside me when my hearing protection fell out of my ear, which I describe as the loudest sound I have ever heard. The tinnitus is like a faint noise that is easy to hear when in a silent environment. Usually I can tune it out otherwise.

I also regularly wear gaming headphones to listen to music/game and I wonder if the vibrations from this are part of the reason why I clean/scratch my ears.

A few days ago I was starting to wonder if the tinnitus symptoms could be due to excessive ear cleaning. I know that you are not suppose to clean your ears and that earwax in general is nothing more than an annoyance, but it is a habit I have been unable to shake for years.",t2_wpth9,0,Is excessive ear cleaning related to tinnitus symptoms?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12mvcnz,True,zirkon0999,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12mvcnz/is_excessive_ear_cleaning_related_to_tinnitus/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12mvcnz/is_excessive_ear_cleaning_related_to_tinnitus/,474923,1681547468,0,,False,1681547481,1681547481,2023-04-15 08:31:08,,,
882,AskDocs,"I am 21M, 1.75m tall, 67kg, experiencing a weird numb feeling in my limbs after smoking weed. Happens for about a week after. No existing medical issues, currently on Lexamil/Lexapro 10mg but have experienced these symptoms before I started Lexamil. I drink occasionally. I do not smoke cigarettes or vape. And I have only smoked weed 4 times over the past 3 years, and I've had the symptoms every single time. South Africa.

Further comments: So I've tried weed a number of times now and every single time I've had weird symptoms that seemingly only happen to me. It's like I lose partial feeling in my limbs, where everything I touch registers in this weird delay. Or another way I would describe it is that my skin is only registering physical touch every other half-second; so every other half-second it's completely numb. I would almost describe it as pins and needles but not quite. The weirdest part is that it persists for about a week after I smoke, which really makes doing everyday tasks difficult; I would pick stuff up and not get physical confirmation if I picked it up until a second after. Not even my doctor really understands where my symptoms come from. I've tried different strains to make sure if maybe I reacted badly to a specific strain.

This is my biggest insecurity, but it also causes me pain because the lower part of my ribs that stick out the most are sore all the time and anytime i move i can feel them rubbing against my skin and it hurts really bad.
I developed an eating disorder when i was 16 because i was hoping it would make me look smaller to combat the ribcage but i havent changed at all

My ribcage is wide, but aside from that it protrudes very badly.

My waist is 25 inches but just my ribs not including my boobs is 36, with boobs its 43 
this gives me a very very weird figure, i look like im sucking my stomach in and aggressively poking my chest out at all times. 

once my ribs end, theres about a 5 inch sudden concave to my stomach, it looks like my chest is hanging in space.
Ive tried to gain weight in my stomach to possibly cover up the ribs protruding, but it just looks like i have a fat belly and the ribs still poke out.
They also are thick in the back too, up near the shoulders, so it looks like im hunched over when im not.

Are there any exercises or surgeries, anything i could do to help this issue? I feel like them hurting means they shouldnt be this way.

I included a picture i traced of me in a swimsuit do you guys can see, keeo in mind i was kind of tucking them in in this picture, when i stand normally they are almost facing the sun

Atenolol (25 mg once per day for Graves and anxiety) and just started buspirone (5mg twice per day for anxiety.

Hi, I have localized pain in my left buttock that’s tender to the touch where the hip joint is. It is radiating down my leg. I’ve been taking 800mg of ibuprofen and that helps manage it but I still get shocking pain when I get up or pivot and can’t quite walk normally even with the ibuprofen. 

I’m very uncomfortable and in a lot of pain. It is Friday where I am in the US and I am wondering if it is even worth it to drive to urgent care (an hour away and sitting makes it markedly worse).

No history of this. I’ve let physical fitness slide after getting very busy at work and have been sitting and traveling for work (more sitting in a car). Normally I hike and walk frequently but it’s been a few months of marathon work day sitting.

Do I just wait out for weeks or a month until I can see my primary? Urgent care? Feels silly to go to ER, but I am really hurting.

Has been hurting since Wednesday night. I don’t want painkillers other than ibuprofen, so I’m not even sure if it is worthwhile to go in.

904,AskDocs,"Several years ago I (33 male, taking lisinopril for stage 2 hypertension) had a epidermoid cyst become abscessed. I had it removed at the student health center at my university.  I was 26 at the time. I had mentioned to the PA who had been treating me it felt like something was still there, but she dismissed my concerns. It started growing again, and about 2 weeks ago, I noticed the cyst had become very sensitive and the are around it was becoming inflamed. I saw my primary doctor on Tuesday, and he prescribed a course of antibiotics and told me to contact a dermatologist in Albuquerque since there are none here in Gallup. No one will take me in. I've tried ABQ, Farmington, Durango, Flagstaff, and no one can take me in for at least 2 months. My doctor also said to try the general surgery in Grants. IN the meantime, the cyst has begun draining on its own with some very thin but chunky discharge. 

 My question is, if I can't be seen soon, should I try the ER in Farmington, or should I ask my primary to drain it and buy me a little more time?

I spot a lot before, and on my heaviest day I pass huge blood clots. Before, during and after my period I have intense nausea and sometimes headaches. This cycle it hasn’t left me and I finished my period three days ago. 

It’s not just that though. Everyday, whatever the time of the month, I feel discomfort somewhere in my pelvic region, lower back, thighs or tailbone. Getting up is painful, walking is sometimes uncomfortable. It’s not excruciating pain but it’s uncomfortable. I feel that this region in my body is constantly under tension. I also get stabbing pains in my pelvis from time to time. 

Finally the main “symptom” I would say I have is infertility. My husband and I have been trying to conceive since September (so for 8 cycles) and nothing, despite tracking with cervical mucus, OPKs and temperature and hitting all the right days. I ovulate every month. My husband did a sperm analysis that came back very good. 

The only endo symptom I don’t experience is painful intercourse.

Hi all, some context: I’ve had a swollen salivary gland on the right side of my throat on and off for months now. I’ve been to a few specialists who wrote it off as dehydration/salivary stones, so I decided to finally get an ultrasound for peace of mind. These are the results:

FINDINGS:
The right submandibular gland is normal in appearance. No stones are identified. The ducts do not appear dilated.
There is a 5 mm well-circumscribed hypoechoic structure adjacent to the gland that could be a small cyst. No Doppler flow is identified. A small hypovascular nodule is also possible. Could consider follow-up ultrasound.
Small lymph nodes are identified. 
There are no pathologically enlarged nodes.

918,AskDocs," I recently noticed a small green spot on the side of my big toenail, and I'm not sure what it could be or how to treat it. The area around the nail is slightly swollen, but it doesn't hurt but is barley tender. 

 I've read online that soaking my foot in a solution of  salt water could help, and I'm also considering using over-the-counter antifungal creams. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice on what I could do to treat this? 

Also, I'm wondering if this is something I should see a doctor about or if it's something that will likely go away with home treatment. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

 I asked my dad about the swelling a few days ago before the green dot appeared, and he said it is an ingrown toenail. But, I keep them cut pretty regularly. After I saw the dot, I trimmed the nail to see if it would help, in case it was the problem.

I’ve been having a number of symptoms for the past 3 months or so. My symptoms include: 

- extreme bloating (constant)
-feeling full quickly 
- occasionally throwing up when i burp 
- ocasional náusea after eating 
- pain in my pelvis when i try to hold in my pee/ inability to hold it because of this 
- more frequent urination 
- lower back pain (persistent) 
- irregularity in vowel movements (haven’t had a normal bowel movement in months) 
- rarely but sometimes i start my period with brown blood clots (this just started this year) 
- period pains have now become very painful 
- fatigue (been sleeping ~10hrs a night since symptoms arose) 

The nausea and bloating was what caused me to get an ultrasound. As you can see in the picture, they found two lumps, one a little over 6cm and other around 3cm, both on my left ovary which is where the discomfort lies. They believe there might be another one but my uterus was swollen that day because I had just started my period so they couldn’t tell. Cancer is a very genetic factor in my family and I’m pretty nervous about this. What is the possibility that I have ovarian cancer?

Yesterday I went to the bathroom and saw these old shaving blades on my shelf and decided to test them on my wrist. When I shaved them I didn’t notice the various cuts left at all and thought I was fine. I went to defecate and notice there was blood coming out of my wrist. I tried to avoid touching but there was a period for a few seconds where my toilet paper with my fecal matter was near and may have touched each other. I immediately got up and ran water on it as I wiped, then washed my other hand. I didn’t have a bandaid so I ended up using a spare toilet paper to cover the cut. For the next 2 hours, I applied pressure, ran water on it (3-4 times minimum), and exposed it to oxygen, I kept repeating this process until it was mostly healed. I did some research online and found you can get fecal sepsis from it and so far I didn’t get any of its symptoms excerpts for chills(40-50 degrees, I was up at 3 am) and rapid heartbeat(lasted like a minute but could’ve been caused by my anxiety making me think that it’s rapid causing it to beat faster).

Hi I used to take 2 mg risperidone for a mood disorder and felt really stable, I could function and live my life normally. Then I wanted to get off risperidone because of the side effects and drug testing that a new job has. I lowered the dose to 1.5 mg and was on that for 2 months, with no noticeable difference in my mood. I then decided to lower it again to 1mg a week ago, and was fine for 4 days. The last 3 days have been really hard though. I have crazy anxiety, nihilism, and insomnia (I’m writing this now at 2 in the morning) All this is to say I’m going to increase my medication back to 1.5 mg, and the only question I have is if I’ll have any problems from increasing the medication too quick after lowering it.

939,AskDocs,"Hi there, I’m discussing treatment options for Endo and Adenomyosis with my doctor and would like opinions of the best choice. 

I am 37F with 2 kids conceived through IVF. I have a long history with endometriosis - it scarred both tubes causing ectopic pregnancy, I’ve lost mobility of an ovary, and it is extensive across both sides, the POD and there is a Hypoechoic mass attached to my uterus which they think is likely a Deep Infiltrating Endo deposit.

I’ve also just been diagnosed with Adenomyosis, causing heavy bleeding with huge clots. 

I also have a 15 year history battling HPV 18, with CIN3 and LLETZ loop excision. I’m immune compromised so the virus keeps showing up on and off. 

I am now discussing treatment options with my doctor. These are the options and I’d like to know which option you think would be the most effective for my long term health and to really stop the Endo progressing as much as possible. 

1. Laparoscopic Endo resection and Mirena
2. Removal of uterus and cervix 
3. The above hysterectomy plus an Oophorectomy
4. Mirena re-fitted only and follow up ultrasound in a few months (it makes me nervous not to have looked inside to see extent of Endo or check out the mass). I previously had Mirena for 10 years before having kids. 

I have a lot of family history with cancers, including uterine cancer. I’m also scared of the Endo effecting my bowel or bladder, so I’m not super keen to be too conservative.

What’s the issue?
I had a major flare of Seb derm inflammation on my face/ nose and upper moustache area. 

What was my journey? 
I was on Elomet (Mometasone) for 3 days then switched to Desowen (Desonide) supposedly for 2 weeks. Used them twice a day. 

The first image on left was before any steroid use. The second image on right is what 2.5 weeks of use looks like. The inflammation has reduced but not gone. Still pinkish marks that signify inflammation. 


https://imgur.com/a/mBQzWiV

What im doing right now?
I then switched back to Elomet again just to try clear the inflammation. I’m trying it just for 3 days then going back to lower grade steroid again, bringing my total duration of steroid use to 3 weeks. 

Questions: 
1.) I’m curious why my response is rather slow. I’ve heard stories of people responding quick to steroids. 

2.) am I at risk already for using steroid for 3 weeks? What’s the most number of days I can?

What’s the issue?
I had a major flare of Seb derm inflammation on my face/ nose and upper moustache area. 

What was my journey? 
I was on Elomet (Mometasone) for 3 days then switched to Desowen (Desonide) supposedly for 2 weeks. Used them twice a day. 

The first image on left was before any steroid use. The second image on right is what 2.5 weeks of use looks like. The inflammation has reduced but not gone. Still pinkish marks that signify inflammation. 

https://imgur.com/a/9WXcdWk

What im doing right now?
I then switched back to Elomet again just to try clear the inflammation. I’m trying it just for 3 days then going back to lower grade steroid again, bringing my total duration of steroid use to 3 weeks. 

Questions: 
1.) I’m curious why my response is rather slow. I’ve heard stories of people responding quick to steroids. 

2.) am I at risk already for using steroid for 3 weeks? What’s the most number of days I can? 

3.) I wonder if there’s any other things I need to look into/ blood work.

957,AskDocs,"I am a trans woman (born male) in my early twenties and I am concerned about my hormone levels. I have been on estradiol valerate (0.25 mL of 20 mg/mL) injections for about a decade and had sexual-reassignment surgery four years ago (no longer have gonads) at 19. Since the surgery, I have had undetectable blood testosterone levels (less than 5 ng/dL), and I have struggled with fatigue, a notable decrease in muscle tone, muscle weakness, and a decrease in libido. My primary concern is however the long-term health implications on bone health.

Following my surgery, my surgeon recommended that I take a low dose of testosterone to help with fatigue. My primary care provider (nurse practitioner) refuses to prescribe any testosterone. She has told me on more than one occasion that the goal of ""transgender therapy"" is to achieve undetectable blood testosterone levels, and that there are no potential side effects associated with this. As a patient I find this strange given that low testosterone levels are associated with symptoms similar to mine in both males and females. When I told her about my symptoms, she insisted that I get my thyroid hormone levels checked, despite having no history of thyroid dysfunction (tested multiple times). My previous providers (two NPs) gave me a similar answer when I asked. I have been trying to find a physician (FM or endocrinologist) that has experience working with trans people to provide a second opinion. It is, unfortunately, the case that the only clinicians that work with trans people where I live are nurse practitioners, and given my previous experience with NPs, I am skeptical of going back.

961,AskDocs,"Basic info: mid-20F, healthy height/weight, no meds/drugs/smoking or health conditions. moderate covid illness + (recovered/ing?) long hauler. 

I will preface this by saying I want to get vaccinated- just unsure if it is safe for me to do so. I can't get a hold of my PCP's office and don't want to wait until the post-infection immunity wanes.

**Context:**

Caught covid 4 months ago and considered a long-hauler. I had a rollercoaster of bad symptoms for months- shortness of breath (normal O2), chest pain, tachycardia, fatigue, headaches, insomnia, depression, dehydration, diarrhea, ringing in ears, pins &amp; needles, tingling, arm numbness, body aches, etc. **The x-rays, ekgs, bloodwork, heart monitors, and echo didn't find anything unusual in regards to the chest pain. Troponin, d-dimer, &amp; ferritin were normal.** 

My doctor said the problem was my immune system is overreactive. Don't entirely know what this means- but she said it in response to my prolonged intense symptoms and because I reacted with similar cardiac symptoms after my first covid shot.

After my first vaccination I had zero symptoms but 4 days later developed intense fatigue and ""heaviness"" then chest pain shortness of breath and a fluttering heart sensation- which lasted about 3-4 weeks. This was prior to CDC guidance to get these checked for possible peri/myocarditis, so we just assumed it was anxiety and I did not seek testing.

I want to get the bivalent booster now because my risks of greater illness from COVID seem higher than I initially thought (which is why I didn't get boosted before). 

**Questions:**

W**ill getting boosted ""re-trigger"" the diminishing long-haul symptoms? I live alone now and am scared of the consequences of that.** 

**If my ""overreative"" immune system is the problem- does that mean I'm stuck in the middle avoiding both vaccination and covid?** Is there any way to get vaccinated without my immune system overreating?

I just had a C14 urea test and right after I had a bottle of cold water as I hadn’t drank all day prior to the test. 

This made my stomach upset and I ended up vomiting in the car on the way home from the doctors. 

I understand they use a small amount of radiation in these test and since I vomited and got it on me and in my car my ocd is telling me everything is now radioactive. Please let me know if I’m worried for nothing. I can’t relax

My dad had stage 4 squamous cell of tonsil/tongue in 2017 and was treated with chemo and radiation. Has been fine since but he has been coughing and having an odd almost hoarse voice getting increasingly worse for about 4-5 months now. It got really bad and they said it was pneumonia but it continued. He got a CT scan 3 weeks ago, it showed fluid and a mass in his lung. The day he went in he had severe shortness of breath and dizziness and had to take a break. He has had dizziness a couple other times as well. 

He got a biopsy completed Wednesday and the news was stage 4 squamous cell lung cancer that had spread from original site. It is also in 3 lymph nodes in his chest. They have put a rush to get him back into oncology and told him he needs to be aggressive with it which tells me it’s not good news (obviously horrible news but that seems like it is an aggressive cancer). I’m wondering if anyone is familiar with this type of situation/how bad it usually is. I can’t find anything really specific online. Dad is 67 and my wedding is in 2 weeks. Just a very emotional day all around. Anxious to get him in for a PET scan to see if there is any other spreading of it.

Over the last 4 months I've been experiencing insomnia as a side effect of the generic adhd medication I had been taking and as a result, developed the anxious habit of cracking my knuckles a LOT. I used pop them occasionally but now it's just constant when l'm not even thinking, literally if my hands aren't occupied with something else I'm pushing on my knuckles, even if there's nothing to be cracked, at all times. Like, a LOT a lot. Since this started, I developed calluses on the highest joints of almost all my fingers - I've never had these before except for a smaller writer's bump. I'm a skin picker, too, so this hasn't been great because I impulsively pick the skin off these calluses. I've chalked them up to my knuckle cracking habit but I didn't realize that that basically never happens.

DEXA last fall showed low BMD with a Z-score of -2.4 at LS, -1.2 at FN. Very low vitamin D, B12, ferritin when checked last year, now on 50,000 iu vitamin D weekly, IM B12 monthly, iron infusions.

I took about a month off running in Feb/March for MCAT prep then resumed a couple weeks ago - for context, I usually go for longish distances of 9-12 miles 4 or 5 days a week, plus some walking. At first in late March, I just had normal muscle soreness, then mild hip pain toward the end (eg, miles 8-10) of a long run. As of about 3 days ago, I now have ongoing left hip pain, antalgic gait, and pain that persists at rest for hours after a walk or jog, even while supine. I have to take 1300 of Tylenol q8 (so, max daily dose) to get through the day and sleep at night. 

I believe a hop test would be positive, but the pain does dissipate if I'm sitting for a while and not moving around. I'm of 2 minds about whether I need an ortho consult: I think I'm overall low risk, considering my age and relative good health, and I'm worried I'm overthinking this/becoming a hypochondriac, especially because it could just be a strain or impingement or something. At the same time, I'd like to know if it's a condition that's likely to progress with continued high-intensity activity so I know to lower my training load. I think my previous stress fractures have scared me a little, but I don't think femoral neck stress fx has a high incidence relative to the types of stress fractures I've had.

979,AskDocs,"62 male, 200 lbs. white, sudden hearing loss (some tinnitus), since last night, no other issues, non-smoker, drink most nights, no drugs. Meds: Wellbutrin 300 mg, Adderall 20 mg most days, Guanfacine 1 mg, Crestor 5 mg, Propranolol 20 mg x 2 (essential tremor), Telmisartan 40 mg. I have been taking these for several years with no problem.

Last night I woke up and felt what I thought was fluid on one of my ears. It didn't hurt exactly, just uncomfortable, like the feeling you get on an airplane, except that efforts to clear it by yawning or squeezing my nose provided little, if any, relief. I turned back and forth, in much the same way I do when a single sinus gets stopped up. I managed to get back to sleep, but when I woke up I found that I was almost completely deaf in my right ear (when I snap my finger right next to my right ear I hear it in my left ear). I'm not sure what my loss is, if any, in my left ear, as I have shooter's ear, but I am almost functionally deaf.

I had agreed to substitute teach Friday, and so showed up. I really didn't have to teach anything, as the kids had work to do, and in a couple of classes they watched a movie. But I could barely hear enough to carry on a conversation. I told the kids what was going on (I've had them before) and they were nice about it.

I was never aware how much we as humans, much like bats, rely on hearing from both ears. Even though I don't hear particularly well in my left ear it may have been mostly unaffected. Frequently I heard sounds as if they were coming from inside my left ear, like with an ear bud. It was weird. I frequently misplace my phone, and when I did a ""find my device"" it took me forever to find it, as I couldn't determine the location of the sound.

After school, I went to a minor emergency clinic. They said I had a lot of ear wax and removed most of it; they said I had an infection in my right ear. Let me note that I have zero pain other than the uncomfortable airplane feeling and some moderate tinnitus. They gave me a week's worth of augmentin 850mg and told me to finish taking them and then start using some peroxide drops to loosen the remaining ear wax. I'm not really sure why I am supposed to wait.

I've had ear infections in the past and they all have had two characteristics: they hurt and they haven't caused hearing loss. Whatever I have now doesn't ""hurt,"" but the hearing loss is almost total.

Seeing a doctor in my area is almost impossible on Fridays, which is why I went to a quick-treat clinic.

I will preface this by saying that i will be taking him for his 4yr pediatrician visit shortly and will bring this up and see if we can run some bloodwork.

I am honestly not terribly concerned but others are. He has always had a bunch of bruises but doctors weren't concerned. He's been very rambunctious since the weather has gotten better, we live on a property with a lot of rocks. He loves climbing rocks, jumping around, typical stuff for a wild 4yo. Most of these bruises come from incidents i know about. Like the knee bruise and scrape was a trio and fall on gravel. 

He doesn't act sluggish. He says his head never hurts, he never feels dizzy, doesn't have any bleeding issues, doesn't get fevers, hardly ever gets sick. Sleeps well and plays hard. 

Also i am with him 24/7 so not concerned about like anyone doing anything. 

So just wanted to ask, before i talk to his doctor, if this is considered normal or not?

hey everyone, i’m kind of hitting a wall lately with a spike in my stomach health. i’ve never in my life had issues with digestion up until maybe february of this year and i don’t know what it is.

i went to my primary doctor and got a whole bunch of blood work tests. everything was normal. went to the gastroenterologist, they have me do a colonoscopy since i mentioned my mom had colon cancer in her mid 30’s (thankfully caught it early) — mine was clear. 

my symptoms have been:

severe bloating and constipation - 

sometimes painful, but really just very frustrating because i don’t know where else to direct myself to. i’m a healthy person generally, but i have altered my diet since then and still the same symptoms. i can admit i’ve been consuming processed sugars, ramen, and sometimes red meat lately within the past couple of months in which is fairly new to me. 

my next bet would be a food allergy test, but i don’t think my symptoms are normal or just as simple as taking a food allergy test - who knows… i’m not sure if this matters, but i have a small ongoing toothache that i have yet to get checked out (cause it’s not THAT bothersome, but i know, i have to see the dentist)… anyway, i was looking at a tooth map and the tooth im experiencing pain in is connected to my large intestines so that could be a possibility? do i get a SIBO test? food allergy? endoscopy?! i don’t know…

just looking for answers, this has stressed me out so much :( any help is appreciated!",t2_3bzxxuud,0,wondering if i should get tested for SIBO,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12mq0yw,True,Ashleeyg,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12mq0yw/wondering_if_i_should_get_tested_for_sibo/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12mq0yw/wondering_if_i_should_get_tested_for_sibo/,474895,1681533229,0,,False,1681533240,1681533241,2023-04-15 04:33:49,,,

987,AskDocs," For the last week and a half I've been experiencing the following symptoms:

1. numbness and headache on right side of face, ear (And last few days shoulder, hip and leg)
2. Fatigue - sleeping a lot more than normal, need naps throughout the day, little energy to do anything other than bare minimum

No trouble walking, haven't taken time off work (work remote), but my head hasn't been fully in it. Went to urgent care and they sent me to ER, had an MRI all looks fine could just be a cluster headache.

Reflecting on it, the day before this started I went for a run and my right leg felt really off. Is it possible this could be a pinched nerve or something? I would just go to the doctor but travelling at the moment. Type of person who has a hard time resting, but is my best bet to try and take it easy for the next couple of weeks and see if it goes away? Or should I try and find a local doctor?

But yesterday when i smoked the same pre roll alone at home...my heart got fast and my watch showed 150bpm...i lanicked that maybe i took hits too fast...threw the leftover joint...took a bath and licked lemon. I drank plenty of water too....

I had also consumed coffee 1 hour before smoking...

Then the heart beat slowed down but still stayed at 100-110bpm for an hour. I also started having weird chest pain, heartburn nausea and headache. 

Googling these symptoms made me paranoid as google said it might be heart attack...

After 3 hours or so...my heartbeat went to 80-90bpm but was still higher than I usually have (60-75bpm).

So i slept and woke up after 4 hours of sleep in morning (14 hours after smoking)...My heart rate is 80bpm still. Nausea is there a bit but better than before....

i still have tightness around upper left chest but its better than yesterday. Getting palpitations if i lie down.
