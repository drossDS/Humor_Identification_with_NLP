Apologies for the long post, want to be thorough.

Complaint of constant nausea, been to GP lots but they won't do anything other than run blood tests and refer me to therapy (cbt), as a result offered Sertraline but I decline each time. Diagnosed anxiety and low mood, also diagnosed IBS but I've been mostly fine the past month. Tried changing my diet to cut out gluten, lactose, FODMAPs, no difference to the nausea. My diet right now consists of rice + rice noodles, chicken breast, white fish, spinach, oats, pea protein isolate, cacao, greek yohurt, honey, sesame oil, blue poppy seeds, beer which doesn't seem to give me any digestive/GI issues. Every now and then I allow myself to eat things like butter, cheese, white bread, garlic etc but the only difference in eating those things is my bowel movements become loose. I probably eat a few other things but it's hard to keep track, I did keep a food diary for a while but my nausea hasn't changed since then.

I drink 2-3 times a week and use cannabis intermittently via dry-herb vaporising. Bloods showed low iron and vitamin D from my test a week ago, however the nausea persisted even when my levels came back normal last year.

The nausea still happens when i don't drink or use cannabis. Been experiencing this for roughly 5 years, good days and bad days. I've tried propranolol for the anxiety but it made me feel weird and didn't do anything for the nausea which is primarily why I wanted to treat my anxiety, as supposedly, having anxiety is why I feel sick every hour of every day. It's flipped my life upside-down, I've had slight improvement but ultimately it comes back, I've seen so many therapists, and I don't want to try SSRIs if I can help it due to the side effects, but if it's something I have to do then I suppose I'll have to try. 

I don't have much of a life anymore and I've had to drop out of uni because of it, I'm struggling to even see my boyfriend because when we spend time together most of it is spent with me not wanting to be touched because I feel so sick. I'm not scared about throwing up around him, he's looked after me many times.

I've had no answers apart from 'yep anxiety causes nausea' but it's constant. I'm not anxious 24/7, but I *always* feel like I could vomit. I do sometimes but it's not common, as in once every couple months and usually happens as part of a panic attack. I get really really painful periods, like fainting, screaming, vomiting from how much it hurts. A roommate found me passed out face down in my own vomit and called an ambulance a few months ago due to my period pain, but I haven't been diagnosed with anything in regards to that, or tested for anything. I get more nausea through my period and when I'm PMSing though.

Recently it's been very focused on my throat, I'm not sure how to explain it. I haven't felt sick in my actual stomach much, just in my throat and the back of my mouth. And that soft part under my chin especially, like the underside of my tongue but on the outside is where I feel the sensation, it almost feels like I'm going to gag. If I push gently on that spot I do gag. Having my tongue in my mouth is uncomfortable, I usually find that I'm having my mouth slightly open and holding my tongue in the middle so it's not touching the top or bottom of my mouth in order to keep the nausea to a minimum. It does get worse when I go outside or see people, but I think that's because I'm anxious about throwing up when I can't minimise the mess or people looking at me, that part is the anxiety talking.

I don't know if it's all in my head and I honestly feel like I'm going insane, it's always there, I've tried mindfulness and meditation, all sorts, it just never goes away. Even if it's not that bad it's still there all the time and it being there at all is enough to make it hard to eat and keep up with basic responsibilities. My GP always tells me it's just anxiety, but I've been in therapy since I was 13 and nothing has changed the nausea, and they've not run any tests besides bloods and checking my pressure and heart rate.",t2_96yp2a4u,0,Constant nausea rarely accompanied by vomiting,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12ptoxi,True,Iris-Oh-Iris,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12ptoxi/constant_nausea_rarely_accompanied_by_vomiting/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12ptoxi/constant_nausea_rarely_accompanied_by_vomiting/,475529,1681759661,0,,False,1681759678,1681759679,2023-04-17 19:27:41,,,

I've tried to explain this to my doctor on many occasions but as long as I can remember, I'll get what I can only describe as nerve pain between my knees and feet and sometimes elbows to hands. Almost like that sensation you get when you hit your funny bone. It makes me feel so anxious, day and night. It's not constant but when it gets going its hard to do anything for days to weeks.

Ive seen a couple PCPs, neurologists, and rheumatologists. I was anemic and severely iron deficient and one doctor thought that might be the cause, but that is now resolved and no improvement. I've tested negative for any autoimmune disorders, negative for fibromyalgia, no other major deficiencies. Blood work always comes back normal. I've tried taking magnesium (thinking maybe some form of RLS?), no help. I used to be on gabapentin for migraines 7 years ago and I think there was an improvement during that time (could just be the general pain relief), however I was on such large doses that didn't affect the migraines, I eventually was taken off.

(The following timeline might be a bit off, I don’t remember how old I was for everything)
I figured out how to masturbate probably when I was around 12 ish? I remember it used to feel so good, like it was extremely powerful, and afterwards my penis was incredibly sensitive. Like I would do it in the shower, and afterwards I would have to keep it away from the water because the feeling was overwhelming if the shower rained on it. Around 13ish years old I got into what is similar to my current master nation habit. I take a shower pretty much every day, and I would use Vaseline to masturbate in the shower, and would get out of the shower often without cleaning myself with soap or shampoo. I think around 14 I started to ejaculate when I finished. Before that, nothing happened (maybe a little bit of pre cum but not rly). Around 15 time, I also started watching porn or looking at pictures I found on NSFW social media accounts. I think I would start to masturbate, then get into the shower, and think imagine what I was watching while I finished. Around this time I got a girlfriend and started masturbating to pictures of her. We never had sex or anything, but she did show me her breasts once and I felt very confused instead of aroused I think. I didn’t realy understand entirely what was going on at the moment and I was panicking internally so I just smiled. We bike up when about a year later because I just wasn’t feeling it anymore (I was also having mental health problems and stuff which may have contributed) Soon after, I started doing this thing where I start the shower, and masturbate siting on the toilet, watching porn hub or something while the shower warmed up. I don’t know how long I would sit there, but I would try to edge myself to make it take longer because that often made it feel better. My parents have complained that I was taking too long showers and it’s probably because of this habit. 

After a while I got disgusted by the things I was watching, and I was hearing a lot of people talking about the long term side effects of porn (sex isn’t good enough anymore, can’t get an errection, unreasonable expectations, other things)
A while ago I tried giving up porn entirely, I’ve tried only watching hentai, I’ve tried only reading erotica, and a bunch of other things.
I’ve made promises to myself to not watch porn anymore, and I’ve broken them many times. I’ve told myself I won’t watch certain types anymore and that didn’t work out. 
Now I usually turn on the shower, sit on the toilet, bring up the catalog on r/nsfw411 and scroll through to find something I like.

I’m not sure if it matters but I consider myself to be a heterosexual male, but some of the stuff that I was into made me question myself (femboy stuff, cum fetish, pegging…) and some of the stuff makes me feel like I’m sick or something (I used to wet the bed a lot so my parents had me wear pull-ups and for some reason it aroused me, and now I have sort of a fettish for pull-ups I guess?) I don’t know what to think about all that stuff.

At the moment my current habit is that sometimes I will jerk off maybe every day for around a week, and sometimes not at all for week, usually it’s like every other day or something like that. At the moment, I haven’t done it in like 4 days I think? I’ve been trying to do it less often. I don’t have a girlfriend, and I’m still a virgin (most I’ve done is make out in bed fully clothed)

21,AskDocs,"Hello,

Will try to be brief. 37M. I bought a house two years ago. At that time, I had high blood pressure 139/95 or so on metroprolol, had IBS, moderate anxiety, GERD, bruxism.

After living here for a year, I had frequent post nasal drip in my master bed, then got covid followed by subacute thyroiditis. Miraculously when the hyperthyroid ohase shifted to euthyroid, it was the best I've felt in my adult life since my early 20s. Started hypo phase and ate plenty of iodine foods trying to get back to feeling good. I over did it and got iodine induced hyperthyroidism. On last ultrasound, my thyroif was hyperemic. No doc has explained well what that means outside of graves. I am negative for antibodies. Developed insomnia, depression, extremely sensitive to smells, hyperacusis.

A couple months after overcoming the second hyperthyroidism, I became sensitive to my bedroom and evacuated. I started to get better on most symptoms and conditions.

I ate moderate amounts of iodine and symptoms all returned, blood pressure now drug free went from 117/69 to 165/120. Again after time it abated.

I began getting weird chills. Body temp often under 96.5, even as low as 95.7 in my 68 degress house wearing a sweater. I developed TMJ disorder. I started sleeping on couch and got better for little while. Had a basement water incursion and here I am.

We found this whole time there was undisclosed attic mold, crawlspace mold. I work at home next to the open crawlspace. The water incursion spread it more so. My son also developed breathing issues.

Currently I'm on no drugs, take 5000ius of Vit D a day, magnesium, electrolyte powder. I eat only meat, a few veggies, avocados, plaintains and a few other foods. This keeps gerd, suspected hiatal hernia, ibs at bay. Blood pressure is 120/90 without drugs.

My active symptoms are: bruxism/tmjd, insomnia, severe mood swings, severe anxiety, severe depression, muscle spasms, sleep apnea (went from post nasal drip to completely closing throat), poor nasal breathing.

I just want to feel ""ok"" at this point. How much of this could be mold, or hyperemic thyroid. What can I do? I am getting mold worked on in the house, I just dunno how safe it will be and what studies on mold are real. Anecdotally, many trusted people in my life say they moved from mold and healed. Likely cant move. Thyroid when last checked was in range though tsh was on the higher end of normal 3.5 or so. Normally I used to be 1.3.

 *I have pasted the findings of my regular echo below* (The tricuspid regurgitation is new)

• Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an estimated EF 55%.
• Mild left atrial enlargement.
• The mitral valve is thickened and the anterior mitral valve leaflet is elongated. There is bileaflet mitral valve prolapse
and an associated eccentric jet of moderate mitral insufficiency.
• There is mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.
• Dilated IVC without respiratory variation consistent with elevated right atrial pressure 15 mmHg.
• Estimated PA systolic pressure at the upper limits of normal 34 mmHg.
• Given decline in LV systolic function (previously 65%) and technically difficult images with difficult to view mitral
insufficiency, will discuss with the patient moving forward with a TEE.


-Left ventricle cavity size appears normal. Left ventricular systolic function is normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.
-Left atrium cavity size is mildly dilated.
-Right ventricle cavity size appears normal. -Systolic function is normal.
-Right atrium cavity size is normal.
-The aortic valve is probably tricuspid. The leaflets exhibit normal excursion. There is no regurgitation.
-The mitral valve is thickened and the anterior mitral valve leaflet is elongated. There is bileaflet mitral valve prolapse and an associated eccentric jet of moderate mitral insufficiency.
-There is mild tricuspid regurgitation. RVSP is 34 mmHg.
-The pulmonic valve was not well visualized.
-The aortic root at the Sinuses of Valsalva appears normal in size.
-The inferior vena cava demonstrates a diameter of &gt;21 mm and collapses &lt;50%; therefore, the right atrial pressure is estimated at 15 mmHg.

I then saw a physiotherapist who gave me a few stretching exercises to do, suspect c5 bulged disc.

27,AskDocs,"Since December I’ve been having a lot of pelvic issues that I assumed to be female related. I thought I had endometriosis or something similar going on. At the end of December I thought I had a severe uti and the at home tests all came up positive but my urine sample tested at the lab was fine. Since then I have had pelvic pain, episodes of nausea and sometimes chills, fatigue and low energy, constipation, bloating or pressure feeling in my pelvic, very excessive discharge that is often brown (old blood?) and with bits of flesh but no blood, heavy periods, spotting, and general not feeling well. The episodes of nausea make me lose my appetite and I’ve lost weight. 

I finally went to the doctor and had a pap, pelvic exam, vaginal samples taken, urine sample with several tests done on it, and blood samples also with several tests done on it. My vaginal samples have come back negative for stds and infection. I am still waiting for my pap. My vitamin blood tests showed low vitamin d and calcium. My general blood tests showed low hemoglobin, hematocrit, mch, mchc and high rdw which the feedback section said indicated I was anemic. My urinalysis came back with trace of “Leuk Esterase,UA POCT” which the feedback says is just white blood cells. 

My main concern is my aerobic culture came back showing I have “Staphylococcus epidermidis” in my urinary tract. After researching what this means I have found very little on it and it appears to be uncommon in the urinary tract from what I have seen on Google. I basically just know it is a type of staph infection and usually occurs in people who have medical devices in their bodies which I don’t. I did find one study of adolescents who had this infection in their urinary tract and in all cases there was an underlying issue such as bladder diverticulitis or urine reflux. How might’ve I gotten this infection and does it mean I likely have an underlying cause? Is this likely what has been causing my symptoms for the last 4+ months?

Would like to see if there’s anything I can take that will help out or what I can ask/tell my doctor. I have been able to manage my symptoms more so it’s not as bad as it used to be. The first time my symptoms occurred was December 2021, I had very little sleep the entire week and didn’t eat well that day. I went to my barber shop for a haircut and that’s when I started to feel a tingling sensation on my left hand and leg, I also felt like I wasn’t breathing well, mouth was dry, heart beating fast, and weak/fatigue. My barber noticed and said I was pale. After my haircut I ate and slept and felt better. Once this happened I started to pay attention to what it was I was feeling and when because it was happening often. After months I pinpointed what would trigger what. First I noticed that certain foods or if I missed a meal I would get bloated/inflammation on my stomach area which would cause shortness of breath until I belched (lol). I would take peptobismol for this. Second, My nose would get dry with cold air or it would happen randomly which affects my breathing as well. Third, if I don’t sleep well I would feel anxious and would notice my heart rate would be high until I took a nap or slept well. 
Sometimes symptoms 1 and 2 would happen at the same time and it was not fun at all. I figured out that breathing through my mouth would relax me and cause my heart rate to decrease as not being able to breath well triggered what I assume what it could be something like a panic attack or anxiety. 
I started to take ashwaganda before sleep with melatonin and this helped tremendously with my sleep. I also started to take black garlic supplement for inflammation and it also helped out a lot. I do at times get the symptoms but not as severe. I noticed this also happens when I don’t sleep well. 
My question is what can I ask my doc or should do to find proper care for this. (Also, I have been living a more sedentary lifestyle.

**Duration:** Since Dec of 2018

No drug use, minimal social drinking, only medications are birth control and adderall and this problem predates my adderall usage.

I went to physical therapy from Oct 2021 - March 2022 and April 2022 - September 2022. The first PT had me do exercises that often would exacerbate my pain. **The exercises dont hurt to perform, but they make my pain worse the next day.** Pain management was provided through dry needling (which worked very well), but the PT decided she wanted to stop dry needling and have me perform more aggressive exercises. I tried this but ended up being in way too much pain to function as a result of no pain management, so I sought a PT who would just perform dry needling. This kept the pain in check very well but I couldn't afford to keep going indefinitely. Neither PT gave a diagnoses, both struggled to understand what exactly was wrong. The 2nd suspected a possible disc issue, but my lower spine had been x-rayed and looked normal. 

Given that my glute pain doesnt actively prevent me from doing anything (it just makes me constantly uncomfortable later), I don't think its piriformis syndrome. Its an irritating burning ache, but is not accompanied by the pins and needles or excruciating pain associated with nerve pain and it does not radiate down my leg.

As stated previously, my lower back was x-rayed (in 2021) but looked normal. I have not had my hip x-rayed. Frankly I dont think it would show anything and would like to get an MRI, but obviously I dont have a medical degree and I know insurance likes to fight against patients getting ""unnecessary"" MRIs. 

Prior to this pain starting, two notable things happened:

\- Single car accident where I was driving on a highway and slid into a concrete divider on a rainy day, going around 50-55 mph. Impact was on the front driver's side (so the left side of my car, same side as my ""bad butt""). Airbags did not deploy (1999 car though) and vehicle was still able to drive. I did not see a doctor after this incident. After this car accident is when I first remember having this pain, but it may have started earlier.

\- The summer (2018) before this pain started, I started having leg stiffness after runs that progressed to where I could no longer physically lift my left leg (the same side I'm having problems with today). It didnt hurt to lift it, I just physically couldnt. An x-ray revealed nothing, and my insurance wouldnt cover physical therapy at the time. My mother paid for me to see a ""myopractor"" who fixed the problem in one session. I was able to resume running but started having pain in both my lower legs and started waking up stiff, so I turned to stair stepping and weight lifting for exercise instead of running. I'm still having problems with bilateral leg pain but I don't think its tied to the problem in my left glute.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably not really relevant so I'm not going to list them all, but I've had a lot of blood tests run by my PCP and a rheumatologist; all were normal aside from low iron (which has since been fixed).",t2_16hzo1,0,"Desperate to know whats been causing my glute pain for 4 years, physical therapy/exercises and stretches make it worse, 2 different PTs gave no diagnosis",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12prte1,True,boxdkittens,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12prte1/desperate_to_know_whats_been_causing_my_glute/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12prte1/desperate_to_know_whats_been_causing_my_glute/,475519,1681756048,0,,False,1681756059,1681756059,2023-04-17 18:27:28,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3782cf35e65e292ed4ae8aef6bd5da3de140940', 'width': 1000, 'height': 938}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=43046e2479f76650ca9471dfa2de566dbe6bcd0b', 'width': 108, 'height': 101}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d046941ca69f87454ed38172a5a139aaaf9fac51', 'width': 216, 'height': 202}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc763217910ddf8981ff6fb700677caab365106b', 'width': 320, 'height': 300}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e49409df75aee5ce6220c7143742329ab6d1c3db', 'width': 640, 'height': 600}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/pt8_lfJ154yQd8OEs6nyivnAkJpnKbQJtJJlEFhc2uM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2a2c321afec22f2c45b040e2100c3bbd56f869ca', 'width': 960, 'height': 900}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'zgvhpWzlXpExSYg9AjHu5goDUjhiAeR_0o6KlUL2cyQ'}], 'enabled': False}",

Since I’ve been aware of my penis I’ve noticed there’s a bump on my scar where I was circumcised 

There’s like a little pocket with some squishy cartilage like bit inside, it’s kinda rectangular and fits in my finger tips, it doesn’t hurt or anything and I can kinda play with it like inside the pocket it moves and flips around 

Doctors have seen my penis and said it’s fine and I know it’s not an STD as I’ve had it pre being sexually active 

I’ve always been slightly insecure about it because I don’t want partners to feel a way about it

I had a cardiac episode at the very beginning of 2021. An ambulance was called and they wanted to take me to the hospital but I didn’t have health insurance at the time so I denied treatment. My BP was 180/90 and my heart rate was 150+, can’t remember exactly but it was really high. For about a month after that I was unable to stand for long periods of time, and struggled with breathing. My blood pressure was higher than usual, although my blood pressure never exceeded 110/70 prior to that. I had issues with my blood pressure dropping a lot before this incident.

I’ve had heart flutters for years now, but I get chest pain when I’m tired. An issue I’m having at work is I’ll randomly get tired to the point where I think I’m going to pass out and I’ll get chest pain. I also get out of breath easily during that time. 

I’m seeing a doctor soon to request a referral to a cardiologist, but I want to make sure I’m not brushed off as anxiety. The PCM that I saw after my cardiac episode in 2021 decided that I had had a panic attack at work. I know it wasn’t anxiety because there was nothing to trigger it, and I know what panic attacks are like.

Back in December 2022, I had various lumps on the right side of my neck, which I'm assuming were swollen lymph nodes. I didn't have any symptoms of infection/illness. Some came and went but the longest stayed there for over 2 weeks. They were soft (I think - it's hard to distinguish) and didn't get bigger in size. I was debating about getting it checked but it was around the festive period and they all did eventually go away.

Now, I have another lump on the right side of my neck, again I'm assuming it's the same thing. Again, not unwell. It's been about two weeks now and I think it is going down but it is still there.

The only other thing I have now noticed just today are these tiny red dots. I have about 8 of them on my trunk/flank all spread out. They are pin-sized and do not hurt or itch. Never noticed them before. They are not clustered - just 8 individual red dots.

I (21F) haven’t had my period in 3 months, about 2 days I started spotting and it was only spotting for the first two days and then yesterday I had cramps but nothing too bad and then this came out of me yesterday and ever since blood has been dark red and shiny. I did pregnancy test spaced out and they were both negative, but now I’m not so sure what this is. I’m insulin resistant so I take PreDialPlus 850mg once daily and Dixi 35. I started Dixi 35 a month ago which my gynecologist prescribed since the tests were negative.

Today was my first ever visit to a GI. I went to a senior GI, with 31 years of experience 

I am suffering from loss of appetite,  sore throat, burning sensation there, difficulty swallowing and heartburn, occasional ear ringing too. 

I also have chronic constipation and gas problems 

I was hoping he would tell me to get an endo + colon and tell me to visit the EMT and get a laryngoscopy done.

But nope. 

He was very nice but just prescribed me meds and asked me to return after 2 weeks. 

I was hoping to get these tests done to see if whats happening to me is just Gerd/digestive issues or something sinister.

I am active at the GERD forum and so many people there have had tests like endo+colon+laryngoscopy +barrium water swallow + esophageal manometry.

Current issue: I've been sick a lot more recently, which is unusual for me. I was sick with a cold during finals in mid-December 2022; gastro in early-mid January 2023; another cold contracted from my clinical group colleague in mid-February 2023; another cold in end March to early April that I recovered from barely two weeks ago. I am now experiencing some nasal congestion, cough flares (it was particularly worse last night) and my throat feeling weird but not a sore throat. 

I don't feel stressed. Sleep could be better (average 7 hours a night). My resting heart rate is higher (75 vs early 60s), potentially indicating an infection. I've never gotten sick this much before and during the pandemic. I think, before December 2022, I was last ill with a cold was in autumn 2021. I'm unsure if I'm suffering from a low immunity stemming from an underlying cause or superinfections from my habits and at what point should I be visiting my GP about this issue?

So i have claudication-like pain everywhere. I know that sounds odd. But I've been having trouble breathing for quite awhile now. Shortness of breath, heart palps, neck jaw pain that comes and goes but has obviously never killed me. I know something is up, but seemed like no one around be cared so I just stayed bed bound whenever and wherever I could. I've also fainted 3 times this month. 

In January I started having strange claudication type symptoms mainly in legs But I've also had them in my arms and jaw to temples. I've had a right sided earache since January sometimes with stabbing pain, and believe it's artery related, doctors examine ot and say there's no infection/ear wax. I also have tearing ripping pains in the right side of my neck. 

I've been sweating A LOT too nonstop. I feel incredibly sick, agitated, and irritability from the pain and would do anything to make it stop. There is pressure and pain/aching/tenderness at the very top of my sternum that never leaves. My voice goes hoarse sometimes and jt feels related to that. 

Right now currently, it seems like most of the claudication-like symptoms are on my entire right side;- right temple, right ear, right jaw, right neck, right shoulder/arm right rib cage, right hip, right buttock, right entire leg. However, the claudication can also be felt quit a bit in my left jaw, left temple, and left lower back. My lower stomach constantly feels throbby and achey. There is constant pin prickles and stabbing pains in upper back, chest, lower back, groin/pelvis and right leg. Some of it is ripping, tearing, and unbearable.

There's probably more to add but I'm in so much pain my thinking is getting messed up. I feel like I just want to crawl out of my skin.

I notice it the most when walking and holding something in either hand. I’m concerned what it may be because googling brings up vascular issues or even low oxygen.

Doctor ordered MRI’s and said there are no tears and diagnosed it as subacromial bursitis. It’s been about 6 weeks now without any upper body activities and although it seems a lot of inflammation has gone down I still feel a pinch when in certain ranges of motion.

I just feel ill all the time and don’t want to eat. I went from 149 lbs to 110 lbs. I’m lucky if I can manage to eat one meal a day and even then I have to take gravol (anti-nauseant). 

I now have eye pain, dry eyes, and blurred vision, stomach pain, digestive issues, nausea, chest pain, arm/hand and leg/feet numbness/tingling, dark/cloudy urine, emotional dysregulation, and recently migraines (I think they’re from the eye pain). I’m exhausted. 

I want to come off the medication as fast as possible. I’m 5’8”, 110lbs and look like an ill skeleton. It hurts to sit. I feel malnourished and weak. I get out of breath climbing the stairs and had to quit my job because I don’t feel safe driving and I’m scared I’ll pass out and injure myself. All I want to do is sleep. I’ve developed a cough with mucus in my lungs a couple weeks ago I can’t shake. 

I don’t have a PCP (I’ve been on a waitlist for years since I moved here). I live in a small town in the Maritimes (Canada) and have to use telehealth (they outsource so I always get a doc from another province in Canada). 

**Q's:** I’m concerned that being underweight like this is harmful and I’d like to get some blood tests to see if this weight loss and malnourishment has caused any issues. *I’d like to know what tests I should make sure are ordered.* I’m assuming that once I get off this medication my appetite will come back and I’ll be able to eat normally again and gain weight. *Will my health return to normal too?* 

For additional information: I’m normally pescatarian, but I can’t remember the last time I ate fish because the smell of most foods make me nauseated now. I don’t eat meat. I don’t drink or use any substances. I used to take vitamins B12 and D3 for deficiencies, but I’ve been fine for years and haven’t had to. I started taking a prescription for my gerd again (only since being put on the topiramate though, before that it was manageable).

A month ago I had a very painful morning urination (felt like peeing out barbed wire) and bright red blood when wiping (I did not have my period), and sharp RLQ pain that lasted about 5 minutes. No fever, no back pain.The painful urination lasted most of the day but decreased in pain with each time urinating and the amount of blood decreased each time urinating. 

The next day I went to urgent care for ear pain/cough and mentioned the painful urination/blood. I was told that my urine sample showed no blood or sign of infection and the culture came back negative. The APRN told me I was probably having spotting from my IUD and it was not coming from my urethra.

Twice since then I have had days with similar painful morning urination, though not as intense; painful urination for two or three times urinating and light blood noticed on the toilet paper. I did use a mirror while wiping and know it was not menstrual blood. The rest of the time I have had no pain, no blood. No fever, no back pain, no abdominal pain. I've never seen any kind of stone in the toilet.

I've just had another painful urination and light blood. No back or abdominal pain.

Hypertrophic scarring due to head trauma 

No current medications

My son has a traumatic facial laceration scar that has had complications and is now becoming hypertrophic. Our pediatrician referred us to derm. In our area and with our HMO insurance a referral is required

Today the derm called me to schedule and upon discussion of insurance I mentioned, I have private health insurance HMO which they accept and our deductible is already met. And my son also carries Medicaid as a secondary insurance

Immediately the lady told me sorry she called me but they can’t accept him as a patient if he has Medicaid. I explained it’s ok if they don’t accept it, I will just use our primary insurance and pay OOP any copays. 

She said no, it’s their office policy to NOT ACCEPT any patients at all while they have active Medicaid. I asked why? She said “people with Medicaid tend to not pay their bills.”

Is this legal? Ethical? What do I even do? I can’t cancel his Medicaid just to be seen at the office but it feels discriminatory to refuse to even see him. I understand not accepting or billing Medicaid but this is another level I haven’t experienced. 

I tried searching for derms in the area who do accept Medicaid patients and none appear to and they all require a referral anyway.

I am an Asian/white 51 year old female 110 lb . I am taking 50 mg Spirolactanone  and 1mg Bystolic for hyperadolsteronism hypertension. BP is 127/89/50 monthly average with medication .  Without medication my dystolic blood pressure raises to 100 but the systolic and heart rate stay normal . 
I feel tired with brain fog at least a week out of the month and have to stay in bed for a few days . If I exercise beyond an hour (like go on hikes ) I am fatigued for the rest of the day. I used to be very active and would push through when I felt faint thinking it was good for me till I got the low sodium levels of 130 on my tests last summer and my dr told me to limit excessive exercise so now I’m a lot less active and have gained 5 lb . I do walk every day and take spin and cardio classes a few times a week. She told me to get off of the spirolactonone and then slowly ramp up again. When I got the meds off my bp shot back up so now I take half what I was taking and my sodium levels went back up to what they were which was still low . My sodium levels have been 134 for the last 5 years (that’s all the tests I have access too ) even before i took any  medications and so have my white blood cell count at 3.7.

I was seeing an endocrinologist but she told me to see a hypertension specialist because she was baffled by my low sodium but high adolsterone , my adolsterone level is 60 and normal range is max in the 20’s . I tried to make an appt with a nephrologist but I haven’t been able to connect my paperwork to them yet but I am seeing a cardiologist who did an ekg and echocardiogram and my heart is in great shape he prescribed bystolic but that alone doesn’t get my BP down.

80,AskDocs,"I am a healthy (I hope? I do deal with health palpitations and shortness of breath at times…) mid 20s woman who wants to get an IUD. My doctor suggested conscious sedation during placement as an option for me, because speculum insertion hurts a lot for me as if I am getting split in half/stabbed and she can’t insert it (interestingly enough, PIV and tampon insertion and fingering cause me no such issues). And after reading so many horror stories on Reddit, I have also expressed anxiety to my OBGYN about the pain. 

But I still don’t understand the concept of “conscious sedation”. At this point, I’m a lot more afraid of the anesthesia part tbh, because I know that it is not without risk. It seems like I’ll be given fentanyl and Xanax through an IV. 

What does that mean for me? Will I be “out of it” (not sure I want that)? I’m also incredibly afraid of being “loopy” and saying something stupid or embarrassing or regretful. Will that happen (mainly from a mental/behavioral standpoint)? Basically, I think all my anxieties center around a fear of losing my mind. I also have a huge fear that I’ll never wake up or something.

As far as the IUD insertion itself, I’m really only afraid of feeling the type of pain I’ve seen people describe on Reddit, but other than that I am totally fine with the idea of being conscious during they procedure itself. What do I do? If it helps, I feel no pain with a smaller speculum, but I’m not sure if that’s enough for an IUD insertion?

I’m mainly worried because I posted about this in another subreddit, and this is a comment I saw in my thread:

**Commenter A:**

&gt; It is not worth the risk.


**Commenter B:**

&gt; She would be heavily monitored and in the best hands possible. It’s definitely not unnecessary. IUD insertion can be incredibly painful as is, and OP also mentioned having issues with the speculum itself which are both absolutely not unnecessary reasons to use some kind of sedation.

**Commenter A:**

&gt; Barely monitored (Dr’s office), and rarely supplied with crash cart and other support measures. Both of those meds (odd combination, btw) can cause respiratory suppression, and their backup plan, likely, would be to call 911. Just not worth the risk imo.

My current diagnoses are hEDS, orthostatic hypotension, and PTSD. I was diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension doing a sit stand test where they checked my blood pressure before and after resting sitting/laying for a few min then standing. Most frequently sometimes when I stand up too quick I will feel lightheaded, sometimes my vision has like a gray/black filter over it(I can see still) and really loud ringing in my ears, sometimes a strange sensation in my face/upper body that’s probably related to lack of blood upon standing, I’ll get pale and then flushed. I would say maybe 7 times it has been more serious to where I lose bodily control/fall if I was standing(one time I was sitting and held my breath after smoking weed, had muscle jerking and lost control) Each time it has happened I don’t lose consciousness, I’m completely aware of what is happening as my body fails me. It starts with symptoms listed above but worse until i just lose bodily control, though I’ve never lost bladder control I have drooled a couple times during this. Everytime this has happened I have pretty severe muscle jerking. Usually just my upper body. My head will jerk front to back or side to side, shoulders jerk like I’m shimmying and arms jerking all over place.

I have one under each of my armpits, 6-8 under my chin, some in my neck, one on my shoulder and a few on both sides of my groin, yet no medical examination was ever worrying (paradoxically that’s the most worrying part for me).
I’ve been suffering from hypochondria and anxiety for a few years now and have tachycardia (every heart examination proved it to be healthy). I’ve been on a blood and urine test, abdominal ultrasound and a chest radiograph and all of these didn’t show anything worrying either (except for a slightly enlarged liver, and lymph nodes also present in the abdominal, but was told not to worry as it’s supposedly normal).
I have no clue what might be the cause of all this (of course cancer and autoimmune diseases being my biggest fear). I’ve had severe meningitis as a small child (live threatening level) and from more recent stuff I took the Johnson vaccine and had a bad case of pseudomonas aeruginosa (had to take Cipro unfortunately, didn’t do me no good mentally).

i’m not convinced that i haven’t had a ligament torn during my last examination. i didn’t receive any sort of soft tissue scan, and the only time they actually came near my ankle was to touch the surface to feel if it was hot, which it is. i don’t know much about gout, i presume my kidney deformity makes me a little more at risk, but my diet isn’t particularly rich at all, and if it was gout it has been several days since the pain reached its peak and there’s no sign of it easing off. i haven’t had any ankle injuries other than the issue with my physical examination last week. am i going totally crazy, or is this a really weird ‘diagnosis’ and should i seek a second opinion?",t2_1erfc25j,0,allegedly i have cellulitis or gout but i don’t agree,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12ppurl,True,fledermoyz,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12ppurl/allegedly_i_have_cellulitis_or_gout_but_i_dont/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12ppurl/allegedly_i_have_cellulitis_or_gout_but_i_dont/,475504,1681752420,0,,False,1681752434,1681752434,2023-04-17 17:27:00,,,

My doctor is recommending I start Myfembree to treat pain from endometriosis. She said that Myfembree contains hormonal birth control but is not yet approved for that purpose, so she is supposed to tell me to use condoms to prevent pregnancy. She made it sound like she doesn’t think that is necessary. 

For context - outside of concerns with this drug, I am taking measures to prevent pregnancy but would be ok with it if I did get pregnant. I’d have a much lower risk tolerance if there was potential for a drug I was taking to harm a fetus. In my personal situation I would want to keep any potential pregnancy. I would prefer not to use condoms due to issues with UTIs in the past but if it’s risky not to use them, I will. Also, in 6-12 months I would like to come off of Myfembree so that I can start actively trying for pregnancy. 

How important would it be to use barrier contraception while on Myfembree for the next several months?

97,AskDocs,"I posted previously about the “Case of the Mysterious Invisible Urine,” which the pt’s PCP, urologist, neurologist, and now a Psychiatrist have agreed appears to be a form of psychosis/delusion as there is 1) no sign of the urine incontinence problem and 2) No physiological reason that the situation exists except in the pt’s perception. 

Neuro, PCP, and Urology both suggest med review by a psychiatrist. Psychiatrist said “Wow, that’s a lot of meds. Probably something in there is making you toxic. You should have those reviewed.” (Yes, he said “making you toxic.” Yes, he is an MD in practice for decades and very highly thought of.)

We said, “yes. That is what we are here for, Doctor. We were hoping you could comment since there are some iffy psych meds for geriatric patients in the mix and the hallucination/delusion about the urine seems to be a psych issue.”

The Psychiatrist said PCP should be the one to review. The PCP is the one who suggested psychiatry.

So right now, all her doctors are just like that gif of all the Spider-Mans (spider-men?) pointing at each other, and meanwhile, the patient is (from her perspective), sitting and sleeping in pools of her own reeking urine, believes her skin is dissolving/being eaten away from soaking in urine, and now is convinced that the urine has attracted bugs that are crawling on her all the time.

Hey everyone! I am struggling with numerous symptoms of what I think might be nerve related issue. My first symptoms appeared close to the end of January. While I was leaving shopping mall,I felt a very strange feeling,as if the floor under me was falling together with me. It was really strange,my chest felt squeezed from inside and I would stop feeling my legs.This strange periods would last for a very tiny amount of time,literally less than a second. 

The next day,I started getting dizzy whenever I stepped on my left foot,whilst the last strange feeling disappeared. I am a very anxious person and I immediately thought that I might have MS and went to neurologist and had MRI of brain and spine (all three parts),which came back fine. Doc shrugged his shoulders and sent me home.Just to be sure,I went to two other neurologists who also couldn’t find anything unusual. I also thought I might be having stroke or something and third neuro ordered blood work which also came back fine.

Fast forward to April, I still experience some dizziness and left leg discomfort especially when I stand for too long. My left leg and upper body starts shaking from inside.

Next day, i wake up and it's significantly worse. I had to miss school it was so bad. Friday repeats. So i went to urgent care because i cant keep missing school. The nurse practitioner i saw (ha not even a doc) did a swab for strep (negative). Decided its just a combination of a virus and allergies. My throat was very red. The following 2 days were just as bad (maybe worse) i constantly was sucking on lozenges and doing all the other basics (salt water, hyrdation etc.) Yesterday i realized most of my pain was coming from an ulcer on the side of my throat aligned with my tongue. This thing is bad news...i cant talk, chew, swallow, even breathing funny causes it pain. I did some research and lysine + b12 apparently helps ulcers heal. 

This morning my throat is still very red and i still have the ulcer. i cant talk and i still have to miss school.

114,AskDocs,"Into about me: 18M (afab but I am a transgender man), diagnosed with BPD depression anxiety autism tourettes syndrome and mystery heart problem that is suspected POTS but unconfirmed, medications I'm on include Desogestrel quetiapine mirtazipine Testogel with diazepam and zopiclone as PRN, I also take a multivitamin with minerals once a day. 

So I have just been prescribed bisoprolol to treat my undiagnosed heart problems which are suspected to possibly be POTS but unconfirmed as I have to wait for my Cardiology appointment in July to discuss further testing and diagnosis. I was prescribed bisoprolol by my GP under request of the cardiologist who checked my holter monitor results after it showed sinus tachycardia which increased whenever I changed posture/moved/felt symptoms and since my heart rate rests at 80-100 when sleeping, 100-130 when awake resting and shoots from 130bpm up to 182bpm from any movement like standing up, walking slowly, going up stairs, carrying things, standing up for too long etc. I have multiple other symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, palpations, dizziness, presyncope, blood pressure dropping and pulse rate rising from postural changes or movement, random chest pains, headaches, shortness of breath after doing minor things like walking/going up stairs/carrying things, pins and needles in hands legs and feet randomly, heart racing and probably more I left out. Basically the cardiologist wrote I'm 'clearly symptomatic' so I've been prescribed 2.5mg of bisoprolol once a day. 

From what research I've done on bisoprolol, I've seen some people say that they took their first few doses in the evening to try and sleep through possible side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness and nausea. My GP hasn't given me a particular time to take it and has just said once a day at whatever time so I'm just wondering what has worked best for other people.

Posted here before and never got a response so figure out give it another try. I’ve been struggling with the diagnosis of anxiety and recently diagnosed with depression. I am currently taking BuSpar 15 mg twice daily most of the time I’m pretty consistent but then sometimes I do miss dosage. My specific anxiety is centered around health, anxiety, and which I struggle with serious illnesses with me or my loved ones I recently had a guy very close on who’s diagnosed with one of my greatest fears and I am experiencing a setback but it’s hard for me to tell if it is due to my medication, a real health issue, side effects or just my stress in general. I seem to be OK when I’m distracted or when talking to someone but when I am alone, I notice a significant uptick in anxiety symptoms. All of my anxiety symptoms seem to affect the same area of my body, and I’m unsure if it is just because the whole stress or of us because of a real issue, I have been to the ER twice actually more than twice but recently twice I’ve had CT scans clear bloodwork on clearance from Drs. however, 
It is not big enough to quell my panic. Recently I had episodes of where I was lightheaded and dizzy for a week. This was when I found out about my aunts diagnosis soon after her being hospitalized. I did not know whether to attribute it to the fact that I hadn’t been consistent on my BuSpar or just from the fear and stress of the whole situation.

133,AskDocs,"41M, 5'11, 151lbs Caucasian. I take Vyvanse for ADHD and Clonidine at night so I can sleep. Probably not relevant, recently discovered that I have hereditary hemochromatosis which we're treating by donating a whole unit of blood every 60-90 days.

I've been dealing with long covid (fatigue, brain fog, etc.) since I had a mild bout of covid-19 in Nov. 2021. I am a software developer and have been working from home; more than 20 hours per week at my own desk in my living room is pushing it. The fatigue is REAL. Labs from about five months ago indicate that I have Epstein-Barr reactivation. Doctor thinks this is unusual and suspected toxic mold exposure (I live in the Pacific northwest). Urine test via Rupa Health came back positive and looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Test|Value|Result| Not Present if less than |Equivocal if between|Present if greater or equal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Ochratoxin A | 1.77000 ppb | Not Present | 1.8 ppb | 1.8-2 ppb  | 2 ppb |
|Aflatoxin Group: (B1, B2, G1, G2) | 1.13300 ppb | Present | 0.8 ppb  | 0.8-1 ppb  | 1 ppb |
|  Trichothecene Group (Macrocyclic): Roridin A, Roridin E, Roridin H, Roridin L-2, Verrucarin A, Verrucarin J, Satratoxin G, Satratoxin H, Isosatratoxin F | 0.11600 ppb | Present | 0.07 ppb | 0.07-0.09 ppb | 0.09 ppb |
|Gliotoxin Derivative | 0.37500 ppb | Not Present | 0.5 ppb | 0.5-1.0 ppb  | 1.0 ppb |
| Zearalenone | 0.43400 ppb | Not Present | 0.5 ppb | 0.5-0.7 ppb | 0.7 ppb |

First question: How long can Aflatoxin hang around in my system? Aside from white rice (from Costco) I have not had many things on the potential sources list that I can identify. My diet is very restricted these days due to some GI stuff. It's been maybe 2-3 years since I've had any nuts, for example. Having a hard time guessing where this could have come from.

Second question: Trichothecene Group sounds terrifying. 0.9 ppb is an extremely small number but this is the bad stuff. Eliminating exposure (presumably in my home) is my first priority right now. What else is normal to do in this situation? Is there a treatment that can help me get rid of it?

Showed up about 2 days after shaving 


Had a bad bout of jock itch months ago that I kicked. shaved about 5 days ago, and the redness has gone down, but I wasn't sure if it was just razor burn? I shave all the time but hardly ever examine. But since I had the jock itch I'm beyond paranoid. It itches in the way razor burn would but not even really that bad. 
Only on one side and in this one area. I use camera flash so it looks more red than it is. 

Or if there's anything else that looks weird? I have the white lines all along my panty line with the little bit of red crease. Figured because of weight but ive never noticed it again, until the jock itch where I was examining DAILY. One person even suggested lichen sclerosus or intertrigo. 

Personally I think I'm fine with some razor bumps but I'd like a second opinion so I don't do something stupid to mistreat or not treat.

I've recently been experiencing chest pressure/discomfort about 2x / week, lasting less than 30 minutes each. It's pretty dull discomfort, I wouldn't even call it pain. Like a pressure inside my chest. No nausea / fainting / etc. to indicate an immediate medical concern. 

I do not have a primary care doctor I visit regularly, but I did visit a local doctor to discuss this issue. He seemed to think I'm a young healthy guy and it was heart burn, even though I'm pretty sure I know the difference between heart burn and this feeling. Advised for bloodwork and a review, but scheduled my appointment for reviewing the blood work out so far in the future.

I'd just like a simple review of my blood work / seeing if anything on these results point to my chest discomfort or further investigation I should expect from my doctor.

I also have hashimotos and scoliosis. I take 100 mcg Tirosint, 10 mg methylprednisolone, 3 pills twice daily of Taveneos (don’t remember exact dosage), and 2 500 mg pills of cellcept twice daily.

So with all this autoimmune stuff, I was finally able to come off steroids back in the beginning of October. I tested positive for covid at the very end of October and boy did it hit me like a truck- throwing up, fevers, chills, cough so bad my rib became all inflamed, sore throat so bad I couldn’t even talk…etc. at the time I was not on steroids. Thankfully I kicked it after 2 weeks and had gotten antivirals. 

Fast forward to yesterday and I tested positive for covid again but this time I am back on steroids and my symptoms are very very different. I wasn’t even going to test because I’ve had no fever or gastro problems, just a very runny nose/congestion and keep sneezing with a mild cough. Low and behold and I have covid again. I was just wondering if my symptoms may not be as bad this time because I’m on steroids and they’re lowering my inflammation or if this strain is just milder.

about every march/april, i (m27) start to get these itchy red bumps on my hands. very occasionally they will appear earlier in the year but will be much milder, almost unseeable. they’re really only itchy if i brush them against something, otherwise they don’t cause discomfort 99% of the time. when i do scratch them, they get inflamed and spread a bit. they’re pretty mild as of writing this, but kind of flare up if i scratch them/randomly. they typically last into the late summer months, and then go away in the winter. the strangest part is i do not get them on ANY other part of my body. they don’t move anywhere but the tops of my hands and fingers. they don’t wrap around to my palm, they don’t go up my arm, they don’t show up on my face or back or neck, etc. I have a few theories as to what it could be, but they just make no sense and google doesn’t really have any answer i can find.

seasonal allergies make sense, but why just my hands?? a sunlight sensitivity makes sense too, but.. why just my hands? i wear short sleeves and go shirtless in the summer and again, they still don’t travel up my arms, they don’t appear on my chest or face. some sort of sweat gland issue? i just have no clue. i also had and idea track foods that might be causing this. i thought that it might be bananas so i ate a banana and rubbed it on my hands but nothing happened. i’ve done this with a couple of foods to no avail.

my lifestyle does not change much vs the winter other than being a bit more active outdoors. no new meds, i’m not touching any weird plants or petting any cats or dogs that i’ve not been in contact with all winter.

does anyone know what this could be? i’ve never tried any type of ointment, just occasionally use lotion when my hands get dry.

Okay, I can hardly find ANY information regarding adrenergic urticaria. But I am very concerned.

I have had chronic hives for several years. They were always heat induced, specifically when I showered and stayed in the creases of my body. No biggy, just take colder showers or deal with it for 30 minutes to an hour until they went away. Well in December of 2022 my hives changed very suddenly. I had a methylprednisolone dose pack that I was prescribed by my Dr. For an asthma exacerbation. 2 hours after I had the first dose I had SEVERE hives all down my arms and it BURNED. Literally felt like I was burning from the inside out. It continued to get worse and I was breaking out full body hives every single day. But this was strange because they had white circles around them. Which I have discovered is extremely characteristic of adrenergic urticaria. 

However, I do also have heat induced hives and have nearly had to use my epipen due to anaphylaxis.

All of this to say I am scared/nervous that if I use my epipen I will have a bad allergic reaction to the epipen because adrenaline is what causes the adrenergic urticaria.",t2_idzjz6nj,0,Adrenergic Urticaria ALLERGY TO EPIPEN,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12pms9f,True,pslanon,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12pms9f/adrenergic_urticaria_allergy_to_epipen/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12pms9f/adrenergic_urticaria_allergy_to_epipen/,475492,1681747170,0,,False,1681747186,1681747187,2023-04-17 15:59:30,,,

148,AskDocs,"A few weeks ago i noticed a small brown bruise above one of my armpits; now after showering i noticed it again, unsure if it grew or if it is still the same size. I have a symmetrical, but much lighter one at the same spot near the other armpit as well.

Photo (sorry for bad quality, its a difficult spot): https://imgur.com/a/KQFCv4H

I showed it to my mother who told me to stretch it around some, and to her it appears to be located on the skin not inside the flesh. 

I am very overweight and i am aware of acanthosis nigricans, however to my amateur eyes it does not look the same since my condition looks like a bruise, doesn't have thicker skin, and is not located in a skin fold. I do not have a diabetes diagnosis (though it runs in the family), and no PCOS diagnosis.

I will be going to a doctor, but i'd love to have some idea beforehand just for peace of mind since it will be a week or so until i get an appointment. Planning to see both a skin doctor and my general doctor.

Largest was 10mm, rest were much smaller. I’m on protonix/pantopraloze 40mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Seeing a new GI tomorrow as my insurance is changing and I’m wondering if there are any other meds I should ask about taking to heal faster? Or based on the pathology report (below), is the protonix alone enough to heal this? 

One other note is idk how I got this other than stress (I’ve had severe stress/anxiety for the past 4 months that has made me feel sick and depressed). H pylori negative, no history of nsaid use, and I don’t smoke or drink. I do have a family history of gastritis and depression, but I’m not sure if there’s a genetic component.

155,AskDocs,"Hi guys I'm a 36-year old male. I'm 5'11 229 pounds with slightly below average bodyfat. I live a very active lifestyle been working out for over 20 years and I lift quite a bit. I'm mixed with caucasian and hispanic. 

Long story short, I think I might have issues with the way my body metabolizes drugs and possibly even my own hormones. I'll give a few examples so you can understand where I'm coming from - pieces of the puzzle if you will?

&amp;#x200B;

* Recently diagnosed with degenerative disc disease (21 years heavy lifting I guess), before I received the diagnosis I opted to not go to the ER as my brother told me they wouldn't do anything for me. I had a close family member bring over muscle relaxers and pain meds because I was nearly paralyzed from the pain. They told me to take the muscle relaxer before bed time because it was going to knock me out. First night, I took only a half tab and nothing. I figured I didn't take enough, the next night I took a full tab and nothing - 10mg cyclobenzaprine. Supposedly this dose was going to knock me out completely. I had insomnia all night and still had a lot of pain. 
* I take TRT at 200mg/week and I also take anastazole to keep my estrogen levels in check. At the 200mg/week mark, I have to take about 2-3mg a week of anastrozole to keep the E in check. This is perhaps 2-4x what the average TRT user would require?
* I also take daily Cialis for the benefits on BP, slight performance enhancement in the gym and elsewhere. However, 5mg a day wouldn't even scratch the surface. I take 10mg daily and while the half life suggests that it should be active in my system for 36 hours (theoretically, it should be building up in my system), I only 'feel' it for probably 8-10 hours at best. I understand this is a hefty dose, especially for daily use but otherwise, I wouldn't feel anything. 
* Currently battling high BP and was prescribed Telmisartan. 40mg daily doesn't do anything. I saw some minor cosmetic effects at first (eliminating some fluid retention), but it seems like my body has adjusted and is now back to the same position I was in before the medication. Additionally, the medication might have dropped my BP by a couple of points - if that. I've been on for a little over a month now, it's had some time to work. 

I've also done courses of certain anabolics and never really observed any benefits from them. Especially oral anabolics like oxandrolone. 

Furthermore, my TSH is creeping up while my t3 levels are in range. It leads me to believe that my liver is now metabolizing drugs and my own hormones rapidly - so as my body is clearing out t3 faster than normal, that drives TSH up to keep pumping out t3 to make up for the rapid metabolism of the active hormone. 

I have researched pharmacogenetics and I'm looking at doing tests for that and to learn more about my own cytochrome P450 enzymes. I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with that? Or if you could potentially point me in the right direction where I might be able to learn more about what's going on?

I know the liver is responsible for detoxing drugs and even our own endogenous hormones - it seems like maybe my liver is doing too good a job at clearing everything out. Any help would be appreciated.

Overall it seems like something odd is going on in how I'm processing hormones/drugs.",t2_q5or01ii,0,"Drugs Just Don't Have Any Effect on Me, What's Going On?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12plz92,True,FtheBS_,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12plz92/drugs_just_dont_have_any_effect_on_me_whats_going/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12plz92/drugs_just_dont_have_any_effect_on_me_whats_going/,475485,1681746083,0,,False,1681746104,1681746105,2023-04-17 15:41:23,,,

159,AskDocs,"Hi!, I’m male 29 yo, 6 ft, and 260 lbs.
I was diagnosed in 2018 with GAD, OCD white coat hypertension because going to the doctor freaks me out.
I was doing CBT until six months ago and took 30 mg of citalopram and 1 mg of clonazepam daily.
I was tapering off clonazepam, but one week after my last dose I woke up with a panic attack feeling an impending sense of doom and with my hr climbing from 55 to 140. 
My new psychiatrist put me under 100 mg of fluvoxamine ( to increase steadily to 200 or 300 according to my needs and reaction), 0.5 mg alprazolam twice a day and 10 mg of propranolol twice a day.  
After this panic attack I am waking up every night at the same time I had the  attack, only my heart rate does not increase,
 except yesterday when I forgot to take propranolol and I wake up , feeling stressed out and my heart rate going to 108 rapidity going down when I took the dose.
Could this all be because of the withdrawal  effects of clonazepam?. Can I expected the symptoms to go away when the new SSRI takes full effect?.
It makes me nervous because propranolol took my average rhr from 53 to 47 (psychiatrist says it does not matter as I am having no symptoms), and I’m fairly active but clearly overweight, and don’t want to depend on so many drugs.

I get  trichilemmal cysts on my scalp. 

Two months ago I had one removed that was on the back of my head--just about 1/2""  away from the bottom of my right ear. Nothing unusual in the procedure or the initial 2-3 weeks, it healed up more or less like the others did and stitches were removed.

This one has ""lingered"" in healing, meaning it is still occasionally breaking open and bleeding--only a little bit though. Note that when I say it is occasionally breaking open / bleeding, I'm talking it oozes out a **little** bit of blood, like you can dab it a couple times with a tissue and it stops.

Anyway, last night I go to bed, I use a CPAP and my mask was loose last night, so I cinched it a bit tighter than normal to keep it secured and go to sleep--one of the CPAP mask straps sits near where the wound is.

I wake up at around 4 hours later and notice that my head is **soaking** wet. The right side of my head is soaked in so much blood it feels very wet to the touch there is a grapefruit sized bloodstain on my pillow that is extremely dark red.

I clean myself up, apply aquaphor. I assume this is just the incision still healing and the CPAP strap maybe pushed a bunch of blood out, but I was curious if I need to be doing anything different with this incision or if there is cause for any greater concern. Note that upon waking up, I probed the incision extensively with my finger--I could not find anywhere that it was **actively bleeding**, and it felt like the wound was entirely knitted together / healed, so I am guessing it closed back up after bleeding for a while.

Probably a totally unrelated coincidence, I had an unusual headache last night that felt like ""pressure"" and ""fullness"" on the right side of my head, that is abnormal for me but I do have seasonal allergies. I figured it might be a sinus headache or something so I took some flonase, headache was completely gone when I woke up soaked in blood (again, I'm sure just a coincidence, but wanted to mention.)",t2_hnil5,0,"Scalp incision bled very profusely overnight, should I be doing anything different?",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12plgqs,True,Broxian,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12plgqs/scalp_incision_bled_very_profusely_overnight/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12plgqs/scalp_incision_bled_very_profusely_overnight/,475484,1681745413,0,,False,1681745433,1681745434,2023-04-17 15:30:13,,,

Took one poop but there was no diarrhea (loose frequent stools). Went to the doctor on Mon and he thought it was gastritis. Ate omeprazole for a good 2 days and no recovery. Went to another doctor on Wed. Still no diarrhea or vomiting, given antacid again! Gastritis she said. Went to the government doctor on Friday. Coincidentally the day before I had more visits to the toilet than usual with my stomach just burning, but no nausea. He gave me stomach cramp pills and charcoal pills and I slowly got better. Thing is it's been 3 days on charcoal pills and I do feel much better. BUT every once in a while I do feel a slight discomfort, and like small pokes and left and right of the lower abdomen.

The diet might be taxing on the digestion.

How long should I keep to a clean diet, and should I go to the ER to see if it could be appendicitis? Or maybe I'm just overthinking this because of my fear of appendicitis?

It’s not unpleasant necessarily and at first I thought it was my body odor or clothes but I’ve ruled that out.  I can’t pin exactly what smell it is but it’s most related to breakfast food if that matters at all.

I’ve had other health issues arise in the past year such as significant depression, moodiness (i have been correlating this depression), urinary issues (trouble starting/finishing)(not often), weight gain, trouble focusing, swelling feet/ankles (sedentary lifestyle due to long office hours), and lastly but most significantly feeling as if I’m losing touch of reality in a way (letting my house become utterly trashed, ignoring most of my personal responsibilities regardless of impact, very apathetic, no sense of motivation, etc.).

173,AskDocs,"17F. About 2 days ago, I was at a hangout and one of my kind friends offered me to try a drink (not alcohol) that I said I had never tried before. I have good hygiene, and understand that sharing anything is a risk, but I fell under peer pressure in fear that I’d make her feel bad if I didn’t accept to take the drink. So I take the cup, chose an end she didn’t drink from, and took a small sip. 

Time jump to yesterday, when I started to convince myself that my lips felt off. They were drying out, even when putting Vaseline and chapstick on them, which caused me to freak out more when i started feeling some tingles on my lips. That being said, the day OF taking the drink I had been really bad about keeping my lips from being chapped (wasn’t using chapstick enough). I believe there was one other person there too who had insisted on coming although they were somewhat ill some time before, but no one really shared anything with them except the air around us. It’s allergy season I think, and my nose is stuffy and my mouth/throat is dry currently.

I know this means nearly nothing, but the person I shared a drink with is very clean and I have never seen her with an active cold sore on her mouth after knowing her for at least a year now. It’s been about 30+ hours since, and I’ve been subtly stressing. My lymph nodes don’t feel swelled, there’s no blisters or sores forming in or out of my mouth, and *down there* seems normal as always. The only thing I can account for is the feeling in my lips, but I am unsure if it an actual symptom or my anxiety psyching me out. Makes me feel as if every single thing that happens is a result of a developing sore. 

Despite my risk taking, I’m highly afraid of disease and surely have learned my lesson. I was wondering how long cold sores usually take to show up after first contact, and what symptoms I’ve said are result of that or from something else. Can anxiety induce felt symptoms, even if you don’t have the specific disease?

Yesterday afternoon I had a first date, we planned to meet at a restaurant inside of a park (a place I know well) but then to walk off/fool around in a more secluded picnic area. I was running late and the man said he was stopping at a beer garden nearby for a cider, and that they had ordered me one too. I got there, the drinks were already on the table. I had only a few sips of it and immediately started to feel “something is really wrong.” They told me then that it was pineapple flavored cider (even though I had specifically told them I was allergic to it, when they asked for dietary restrictions just 1-2 hours prior).

He eventually called, and what was actually a 8 minute wait felt like hours. During this time I was floating in and out of consciousness and felt like I was dying.

Hello, before anyone asks I have just seen the ENT. 

For the last three weeks I have had a persistent feeling of dripping fluid inside one of my ears. I have been treated with oral antibiotics and otofloxacin ear drops on and off for the duration of those weeks. I also had to do a course of anti-fungal drops at one point due to the overuse of the otofloxacin.  Finally my PCP referred me to an ENT. 

The ENT completely cleaned out the ears and auctioned out whatever wax/liquid was inside the ear but noted that he did not see any sign of infection. I was given a hearing test (I have experienced a small difference in hearing through the course of this) which detected no hearing loss outside of “normal range”. I don’t really know what that means. 

Anyways; the ENT took me off the oral antibiotics and said to take a reduced amount of the otofloxacin drops twice a day for a week and to follow up in one whole month. I can go ahead and tell you it almost feels like the drops are making the sensation worse. 

What do I do? Should I stop taking the drops? They’ve  already given me a fungal infection once.   

I’ve experienced no pain or itching with this infection, but the persistent fluid like sensation in the ear and the hearing loss is prohibitively annoying. Could there be something else going on?

Should I go back to the ENT before my follow up? This has gone on too long in my opinion.

I've put on a fair bit of weight since the pandemic, but I still go cycling 3-4 days a week, and can do vigorous and lengthy cycles. 

Heavy drinking - more days than not for the last few years. Only ever beers, and around 4-6 330ml cans. I'd have a month or two of ever year, but it was becoming a bit of a crutch. 

Anyway, I had a full blood test done last week, and got my LFT results back - they were all within range, except the ALT, which was at 62UL. Doctor sent a text today to say I need to book in an appointment to discuss. 

I'm now freaking out that i have irreparable liver damage or cirrhosis. 

I'm obviously not asking for a diagnosis online, but i'd like to know what kind of ALT levels you'd expect to see in people with liver disease or cirrhosis? i've checked online and the opinion seems to vary wildly. 

I've stopped the drinking and have committed to doing more exercise and healthy eating. 

Also on 100mg lamotrigine for epilepsy.

Hey everyone, two weeks ago on Monday I went to the bathroom and noticed some little blood (bright red) in my tool only when I wiped. I was a bit surprised by this but didn’t worry too much, however, I went few more times to the toilet on that day (no more blood noticed) and started experiencing some discomfort in my tummy. This went on for 4 days and it stopped completely on Friday that week.

However, last Monday all these symptoms came back. I noticed that my stomach feels a bit upset (kinda like full) after eating or drinking anything, and also feel that it starts gurgling quite a bit. Never noticed blood in my stool again but it has a soft consistency and yellowish/light brown colour (kinda like peanut butter) as well as having some undigested food in it. I am still feeling the same and doing bland diet. I also started taking paracetamol and notices that the discomfort gets better afterwards. 

I went to the doctor last week and explained the whole situation, she did not seem too concerned and suggested to send stool sample to analyse for bacteria, parasites, occult blood and gastroenteritis (still waiting for the results) I did some routinary blood work 3 weeks ago which turned out quite good. 

I gotta admit I have a pretty bad health anxiety (which my doctor is aware of), but my anxiety levels has not been any different from the past few months so I am surprised if this was caused by it.

Has anyone experienced these symptoms? I am a bit worried and would like some more insights and feedback so please share your experience/opinions, it would really help!

Hey Docs! 

Quick question, I’ve been taking Doxycycline for the past 5 days after believing I had a mild case of Prostatitis. I had the Doxy in my cupboard. 

I finally managed to get a GP appointment today where I received a diagnosis of Epididymitis. 

My doctor has prescribed Levofloxacin for 10 days to treat this. 

Should I immediately discontinue the Doxy and start tomorrow fresh with what the doctor has prescribed? Or should I finish the last 2 days of my doxy and start the Levofloxacin once it’s gone? 

I realise I probably shouldn’t have taken the doxy but I was in pain and couldn’t get a GP appointment at all. 

I just want to make sure I do the right thing.

It seems like a muscle and after massaging it's relieved, but I would like to know if there is any way how to get rid of the pain completely.

204,AskDocs,"My son is 3, last well visit he was 34"" and 29lbs (I think). No preexisting conditions, generally a healthy kiddo. No meds, other than we've been giving him Miralax (3tsps) periodically, have used Pedia-lax laxatives once in the past few weeks, (all as instructed by RN at peds office). 

A few weeks-possibly a month ago, my son was a little constipated.  It happens periodically, but usually he was always regular, sometimes going a few times a day.  I think at one point when he was constipated (he had dry little poops, and was at the time not feeling well and probably not hydrating enough/eating enough fruits and veg) he must have been in pain.  This has created a situation where he seems to be afraid of pooping now.  He will tell us that he ""doesn't want to poop,"" or ""maybe tomorrow,"" or he will scream and throw the biggest tantrum in the world if you bring it up.  He will withhold his stool for days until we literally eject it out of him, either with the recommended dose of Miralax, or prunes/pears/apple juice, as directed by the RN at our peds office.  What is concerning is he will run around grabbing his bum and saying ""my butt hurts my butt hurts!"" and it does seem like he's momentarily in pain.  Sometimes he poops. Sometimes he will say ""my butt hurts! I don't want to poop!"" But when he has it is not dry or even hard. It's just as normal as it was before.  

He has had a little bit of a diaper rash/redness/irritation around his anus, which we've used diaper cream for, and it's cleared up, but then come back. I don't know if he's going a little, but retracting it (?) and causing this irritation? 

We've stopped working on potty training. We've done everything that the nurse at the peds office has told us, but she was also hesitant to schedule us an appointment because she's not sure what the doctor can even do at this point. When he does go, he seems to say he feels much better.  He also says ""that wasn't scary!"" Outside of these random outbursts of his ""butt hurting"" and not wanting to poop, he's not changed at all... still playing, eating, being a general threenager. 

Is this something I should press for him to see the doctor? Does it sound behavioral, or could there be something really wrong? I don't want my baby to be in pain, but I'm also not sure what is even going on (he's 3 and it's kind of hard to tell if it's just an uncomfortable feeling, or he's actually in pain).",t2_135qdk,0,Stool Withholding (?) with my 3 year old,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,nsfw,False,default,[],{},,True,text,3,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,True,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12pimnm,True,hounddogmama,,1,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12pimnm/stool_withholding_with_my_3_year_old/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12pimnm/stool_withholding_with_my_3_year_old/,475463,1681741957,0,,False,1681741977,1681741978,2023-04-17 14:32:37,,,
205,AskDocs,"24F 5’6 155lbs I’ve been taking paliperidone for schizophrenia for about 10 months. Because of trying out so many antipsychotics that wrecked me, I began to sleep for upwards of 16 hours a day, and sometimes took a nap too. I lowered my dose of paliperidone a little and started taking modafinil to give me more energy. 

I started experiencing lactation from my breasts (not pregnant, never have been). My doctor said it was due to the paliperidone and I eventually had a blood test to see what my prolactin level was. Finally after months he prescribed me with bromocriptine to lower my prolactin levels. I’ve been taking it for maybe 2 weeks now, and I think I’m on 2.5mg. Since taking it, I’ve had SIGNIFICANTLY more energy. I only sleep 8-9 hours a night. Sometimes I need a nap, and I’ve been going to bed a little earlier, but I finally feel like a functioning human! 

Here’s my question. Does having high prolactin cause a lack of energy and excessive sleeping? I’m wondering if lowering my prolactin levels is what’s causing me to have significantly more energy.

211,AskDocs,"Hi docs: 

34 y/o F. I had a profuse uncontrollable nosebleed the night of 4/5/2023 into the morning of 4/6/2023. This was 5 weeks s/p leforte 1 surgery, bilateral inferior turbinate reduction, and septoplasty. I have no bleeding disorders or other medical conditions and no history of prior nose bleeds or nasal trauma. I had been taking aspirin and tylenol for headaches. I have since stopped the aspirin.

Healing was going well after the surgery; the nosebleed seemed to come out of nowhere. I went to the ED and ENT consult had to be called to get the bleeding under control. The otolaryngologist identified active bleeding on the inferior left turbinate and a small area of bleeding superiorly within the nasal vault on the right. The bleeding was controlled with dissolvable nasal packing. I haven't had any bleeding since. I also had a CTA done that night which was negative for pseudoaneurysm. 

I've been on nasal precautions to last two weeks. The thing is I had a flight scheduled for this Wednesday 4/19 to go to my sister's wedding which is just before two weeks of nasal precautions are ending. 

I'm nervous about the pressure changes on the plane. Otherwise, I can bring a portable humidifier and keep my nasal passages moist with nasal gel/petroleum which I've been doing daily anyway. Also the flight is from the east to the west coast so about 6 hours. 

Any thoughts on whether it would be too risky to attempt the flight at this point?

So for the past 2-3 weeks I have been suffering from quite severe bloating, cramps and stomach pain 24/7. I'm not sure what the issue is and have been contemplating visiting a doctor for the past few days to see what a professional has to say. I wouldn't really say I have diarrhoea or constipation however, my stools do tend to differ every day. I have been taking doxycycline since September last year and really only occasionally took probiotics with it, since this bloating and cramp started I have started taking it every day, I'm not sure if that might have killed my gut.

So, to explain I (22F) recently had a miscarriage. I would’ve been about 7 weeks. My doctor took my bloodwork twice, and saw my levels were decreasing pretty fast and confirmed that what I was going through, was a miscarriage. I passed two of these clots in the same day and was able to take a picture of them. I sent the pictures to my doctor and asked her if this was for sure the fetus. She told me “it definitely is an interesting picture because you were about 7 weeks, and this definitely has the shape of a fetus, like it was in the early stages of forming so it is very possible that this could have been the fetus” which to me sounds like she’s pretty much saying “I don’t know, it’s possible but I don’t know” And I just want to know if that’s what it is. I know nobody is going to have a definitive answer, but I just want to ease my mind knowing if this was, or was not my fetus. Please let me know your opinions if this is the fetus or not. My doctor hasn’t given me a straight answer and it sucks. I just want to know.",t2_f7gus0uw,0,"I had a miscarriage, is this the fetus?

Whenever I’m falling asleep and right on the brink, I get a sharp chest pain right in the middle of my chest, directly on the sternum near the surface. I’ll shoot upright for a few seconds and then feel completely fine. It can happen three or four times in a night and be completely hellish.

Hi Everyone,

I’m seeing conflicting information online. There are as many resources saying that it is possible as resources saying that it is not.

One week ago, I went on a girls’ trip. We all shared bathrooms. I accidentally wrapped myself in my friend’s towel for approximately two minutes before we realized my mistake (we both got new towels). I left my washcloth in the bathroom but assuming my mistake, I’m not sure if either of my friends could have made a similar mistake with my washcloth (which I actually did use *inside* of my vagina while showering). We all had similar looking personal items.

What is the likelihood that either of these scenarios of indirect contact could transmit an STD/STI? I am having slight vaginal itching and pelvic discomfort that feels like gas/dull cramps (period finished earlier this week). One of my friends was successfully treated for ureaplasma/mycoplasma, but can either of those be transmitted through accidental use of the same washcloth/towel?

Please advise!

I say this because she’s been in the same treatment center as me for the past ~35 days (I’ve been in-patient for 64 days) and she’s still testing positive for benzodiazepines on her UDS. Back story on her: she’s been on Ativan since 1994 and there at the end she was on up to 12mg a day before she crashed and burned and ended up in a detox facility where they gave her a Librium taper. Apparently the last time she ever ingested any Librium was March 5th. She’s 65 years old, she’s probably 5’5 and weighs 230 lbs. is it possible at all that she is truly clean and it’s taking her this long to not test positive? Her behavior is really weird lately- all the symptoms of a sudden detox off of benzodiazepines. I recognize this because I’ve been there many times myself. But even after years and years of use and abuse of Xanax, klonopin and Valium the benzodiazepines are usually out of my system after ~15 days. Am I being delusional or does staff need to be aware of this situation? I know her husband still uses Ativan and she had a visit with him a couple of weeks ago so that’s where she could’ve gotten it.

  I’ve calmed down a bit since my initial post, and I’m hoping that this is just some mistake because I’m quite alarmed by this revelation. I recently asked my mother for my exact blood type out if curiosity, as i’ve been told that it’s ab ages ago when i was around 11, and never really questioned it. She mentioned something about the doctor saying that it was rare and that i should donate once i’m older, but that’s about it. She told me that my blood type was AB, and i kept pushing for her to tell me the rh group, due to how as far as i knew at the time, you can’t just be an AB without having any rh groups. She sent me an image of my birth records, and surprise surprise, no rh group was selected. 

I’m planning on donating blood soon, just to get the results and see what my actual blood type is because the prospect of being an rh null terrifies me

I have developed severe psychotic episodes where I want to freak out at people and have destroyed most relationships in my life and panic attacks. Doctors do not seem to care. I went to the er and nothing. I had cbc and liver and kidney panels done. Nothing despite me used to and maybe still having non alcoholic fatty liver. I do not drink or smoke though edibles in 2020 set off the initial psychosis along with some issues with relationships.

So I have had since september of 2022 extreme and severe fatigue which gets worse and worse. No matter how long I sleep I am still tired. I worked overnights for 6 years and do it now but I can barely make it through a 6 hour shift and I get angry and tired. My doctor is allowing me to do a sleep apnea test, my father and grandmother have it.

Also, I took adderall for about a year. I don’t know if my body became addicted to it or what but I always took 40mg.

Below is the latest MRCP report. Pursuant to numerous MRCPs over the last 3+ years the pancreatic duct has been reported dilated 5-7 mm. Last EUS (negative brushings/biopsies) on 1/21. Earlier EUS’ and ERCPs reported negative brushings/biopsies. The doctor speculates a possible side branch IPMN.

The patient is a 74-year-old male. Occasional upper left abdominal pain from gastritis.

What procedures/labs are suggested for continued surveillance? Is a prophylactic resection a good idea? 

IMPRESSION:

1. No pancreatic duct cysts seen. Previously described pancreatic tail cyst likely due to the pancreatic duct seen on end.

2. Pancreas divisum. Stable mild dilation of the main pancreatic duct

EXAM: MRI MRCP W/WO CONTRASTCLINICAL HISTORY: pancreas cyst.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar-multisequence imaging of the abdomen was performed prior to and following the intravenous administration of 7.5 mL Gadavist. MRCP imaging without contrast was performed after the administration of secretin.

COMPARISON: MR abdomen/MRCP from 9/30/2022

FINDINGS:

Lung bases: Clear

Heart: Normal

Vessels: Stable mildly dilated bilateral common iliac arteries

Liver: Normal

Gallbladder: Normal

Bile ducts: Normal. The common duct measures approximately 6 mm in caliber (series 6, image 58)

Pancreas: No pancreatic cysts are seen. The previously described cyst in the pancreatic tail is likely due to the pancreatic duct seen on end.

Pancreatic duct: Pancreas divisum. Stable mild dilation. The pancreatic duct measures approximately 5 mm in caliber in the pancreatic neck (series 3, image 32)

241,AskDocs,"I don't know who else to ask or talk to about this so I hope I can post it here and get some advice/help. 

I'm 25 and I've been to the emergency room 6 times already because of heart palpitations and (what I assume is) tachycardia. One time I had 240 bpm. They did tests on me but never found anything, told me that I'm fine and sent me home. I should also mention that I have anxiety which I know can also be the reason why I get palpitations and fast heart rate.

But what made me write a post here is what happened last night when I went to the emergency room again.
Right after I laid down to go to bed last night I felt my heart skip a beat and then it started beating really fast. I did what I always do; splash cold water in my face, massage the left side of my neck, try to calm down etc but nothing was helping.
It also felt like my heart is pounding in my chest but when I checked the pulse on my neck it felt out of sync with the beating in my chest. 
So I went to the emergency room and as soon as I laid down my heart rate went back to normal. I know it could be because I stopped panicking and calmed down a bit when I came to the emergency room but because that happened the doctors just told me ""I had a panic attack"" and wouldn't listen to anything I tried to tell them. I've had panic attacks before and this was not what a panic attack usually felt like for me. I wasn't dizzy or sick or had chest pain or was even anxious before going to bed. I just went to bed, took a deep breath and my heart skipped a beat then started pounding out of my chest.
Whenever I tried to explain to the doctor what happened and what it felt like she was rolling her eyes at me and repeatedly told me that I just need to speak to a therapist because I have anxiety but I really don't think that this is JUST anxiety related.

I sometimes feel my heart skipping beats when I'm laying on my left side, when I get up too quickly, when I stretch and when I take a deep breath. I sometimes get faster heart rate after eating, walking up the stairs, standing up too quickly, standing for longer periods of time or when I'm in bed trying to sleep. This happens quite often but it never worries me too much. What happens when I end up going to the emergency room is I don't only feel my heart beating fast but it feels like it grows in size and pounds so hard I feel it all over my body. Sometimes I feel shortness of breath too but that's a common anxiety symptom for me and I'm not sure if it's related to the fast heart rate.
I don't really know how to explain the feeling in more detail but I hope I can get some help and advice because I'm scared and worried for when it will happen again :(

244,AskDocs,"Hi All

Ill start off by saying understand fully you cannot diagnose me. I have just had blood tests relating to some of these symptoms (all clear bar still waiting on ESR results) 
I wondered if anyone experienced similar that resulted in a diagnosis, it might give me further confidence to ask my GP for a referral to Neurologist.

Some background:
I am 27 F from Scotland. 
I have had poor circulation in my feet for as long as I can remember. 
My feet and ankles will be red after showering for instance. In the last two years I have had episodes of chillblains in my toes, they would swollen, itchy and sometimes have small ulcers . This would be happen during the night. 
My feet have always been ice cold to touch, I now have this in my hands too, however could always have been there and perhaps I have never noticed before. 
For the last 6 years I have had issues with an overactive bladder that has gotten worse. I am constantly at the bathroom and often once I finish and stand up, I will have to sit back down again as there’s more.
I have had issues with constipation since my teenage years. I drink coffee daily to help combat this (I know this is likely counterproductive)
I am prone to abscesses started in 2019, I get between 1- 5 in any given year always on my buttocks. 
I have issues with working memory but I am also diagnosed with combined ADHD, so I have always chalked this down to that. Since January I have been medicated and haven’t seen any improvement in that regard. 
In the last two years I have noticed an issue with sweating. 
I have since my teenage years had problems with Acid reflux and indigestion.
I have vision problems and double vision, but this is congenital and corrected with contact lenses although my eyesight has worsened with age. 
I had a knee injury in my left side in 2020. It got better but seems to have flared up again. 

Newer symptoms in last 6 months:

I have been diagnosed with Raynaud’s in January 2023. I am currently under investigation to determine if the Raynaud’s is primary or secondary. 
What lead me to see the GP was a flare up in which I had swollen toes, chillblains, extreme knee discomfort, muscle spasms down my left leg, my lower left leg was numb and felt weak when walking. This happened two evenings in a row. It took a week for swelling to go down and I have been left with some discoloured toes. 

My symptoms flare up regularly throughout the month. They are worse at night and in left leg .
 I always have very cold feet and hands. Although during flare ups I will experience tingling, painful pins and needles, knee pain ( below knee cap and inner side of knee) numbness in foot, this can sometimes be in ankle and lower half of leg. 
In the few extreme flare ups I have felt weakness when standing straight and have to shift weight from leg to leg to bare it.

I have muscle pain in my shoulder and lower back that comes and goes.

I am concerned that there is an underlying issue separate to Raynaud’s as the symptoms are tend to be worse on left side. Two evenings in a row last week I had uncomfortable warm feeling in my left knee like I held it close to an oven. It was hot to touch and visibly red in colour. Later that evening my feet also become hot and the soles of my foot throbbed similar to plantar fasciitis sensation ( I had this in my late teens not in recent years) they did not change colour the first night. It was uncomfortable to stand straight and my left leg was achy.
The following night was similar although both my left foot and knee were red in colour. I can’t recall in my right foot was red but I did experience  heat and discomfort in this foot too. 

I experience daily pins and needles. When I shower it can become very uncomfortable to stand due to the numbness. I will often have to sit until I get the feeling back once I get out before drying. It’s probably important to mention I can feel quite squeamish and I can’t pin point if this is why I find the numbness sensation so unbearable. That probably doesn’t make much sense.
I know MS is not genetic but I have heard you may be more predisposed if there is cases in your family. There are extended family members on both parents side. The closest relative is maternal uncle who is diagnosed. I imagine I am far removed enough from these relatives to not be higher risk. 

If you made it this far I really appreciate your time honestly. I apologise if this post is hard to follow. I have only started writing things down recently so it’s hard to remember. 

I just wondered if anyone diagnosed experienced anything similar at the start. I believe my GP will likely be referring me to rheumatologists once bloods come back. I just wondered if it’s worth putting pressure on to be referred to the neurologists.

251,AskDocs,"Hi, I’ve been feeling a slight tightness in my upper left butt, right below the hip. When doing a left leg crossover stretch I definitely feel a significant tightness there, more so than the other side.

The only causes I can think of are either: 

- from doing a single leg deadlift on that side during which I did feel similar strain - 5 days ago

- I was trying an ab exercise on my back on a hardwood floor. Leg lift along with raising my hips too at the top. Once I felt that I had put too much pressure on part of my (near mid top) spine I stopped immediately. - 3 days ago

I don’t feel pain in the area, just tightness. I can also feel that tightness if I put pressure on that buttock area with my thumb. I’ve been walking and functioning normally otherwise. 

I guess I’m looking for reassurance that it’s probably just a muscle strain issue rather than something spinal. 

 I’m freaking out slightly because of googling some results that discussed spinal cord injuries and paralysis, which in my logical mind I don’t think would’ve happened but the thought still terrifies me.

I co-sleep with my 2 year old. This will maybe be the fourth time he has hit me in the eye while he’s asleep. This morning he swung what I assume was his arm backwards (I was asleep) very fast and smacked me very hard in the eye. My question is: how much of this before any permanent damage? Of course I’ll be going to get my eye checked as I usually do when this happens. I’m concerned because I have pre-existing conditions. I am high myopic, I have awful vision, I have two permanent scotoma, I see flashes of light and get floaters. All of these issues are being monitored by a specialist. My eyes are already so fragile and the last thing I want is retinal tear or detachment of any kind.

254,AskDocs,"Hola again doctors, 

I come bearing a photo of my genitals in the hopes someone can help. I have tried to remove my body hair by shaving, waxing, hair removal cream and threading (on my eyebrows/facial hair). The main area I have an issue with is my pubic area obviously and when I shave or wax because that’s what causes the most irritation. 

Within 24 hours I will get ‘razor burn’ or a rash that itches like mad and burns. It’s very uncomfortable and doesn’t exactly look great when you’re shuffling around tryna scratch an itch. I have tried ALL the tricks, like exfoliating before shaving , after shaving…before and after shaving…not exfoliating at all. Moisturising myself like crazy. Warm clothes. Different style razors, different hair removal creams, sugar wax, different other waxes. All of them leave me sore and irritated. 

My legs and armpits also get itchy but the bumps aren’t so bad or noticeable actually. 

Of course I could just not shave or ‘trim’ but I just don’t wanna do that so I’m looking for a solution first. Any medical creams or something out there that can make my vag not look so prickly? muchas gracias!

Age: 36
Sex: Male
Height: 6’3”
Weight: 200lb
Race: White
Duration of complaint: 4 weeks
Location: USA

Any existing relevant medical issues: very deviated septum

Current medications: Nexium, Flonase

Can’t get answers - any thoughts?

Ever since March 21, about once every seven to 10 days, I get a very full feeling in my left nostril/sinus. When I blow my nose, first comes a thick golden clear mucus…almost like honey, followed by a lot of watery yellow tinged drainage (pics in comments). 

It happened again today - most of the day I had pain in my left sinus above my left eye. The left side sinus pain is intermittent, not constant, and doesn’t always indicate the drainage will happen. Sometimes the drainage happens with no headache at all.

I have a severely deviated septum (to the left side, same side as drainage and headache).

I went to ENT on Friday and they did a scope in my nose and saw nothing abnormal. Otherwise healthy, no fever, cough, sore throat.

It’s very unnerving when it happens and unpredictable. Doesn’t happen because of a specific position or exertion. And the watery fluid is a little shocking. After it clears out it stops, but I’m sure in a number of days it’ll happen again.

ENT thinks it’s just allergies but I’ve never experienced anything like this before in my 36 years of having a deviated septum. I’ve had allergies before but nothing like this. No other allergy symptoms, no red eyes, sneezy, coughing, itching, etc. 

At first I panicked and thought it was CSF but I’m pretty certain that’s not the case anymore. Although the fluid that comes after the golden/honey mucus is like water, it does stiffen tissues and has a very slight yellow tinge. 

Nervous about what is causing the intermittent pain, and the thick clear yellow mucus that seems to be holding back watery fluid.

256,AskDocs,"I am male, 26 years old, and about 155 pounds. I've had this issue for a few years, and am not currently on any medication at all. 

I've felt like this for as long as I can remember. It's with only a certain amount of foods, but they're all on the sweet side. For instance, I can have like... Half of a Crunch candy bar. Or one Hershey Kiss. Or, as we speak, half of the Birthday Cake Protein bar I'm eating right now post workout. I can have a small amount without a problem and enjoy it (mostly, I don't really care for much chocolate, but I can totally have like 2 Oreos and thoroughly enjoy both). But any more than the above amount, and I start to enjoy it significantly less. To the point where I feel physically nauseous, and feel like if I were to eat a single bit more, I will vomit


Perfect example with the protein bar right now. This is how it felt right now, and feels with other foods pretty frequently:

- First 20% of protein bar eaten-- Ooo this is delicious! Really enjoying it!

- 40% eaten: Okay, maybe it's not delicious, but hey, it's still good

- (Slowing down) 50%: starting to feel a bit off, but I bet I can eat the rest of this no problem 

- 60%: Ugh shit, I don't know how much more I can stomach. Starting to get nauseous

- 65%: If I eat a single more bite, my stomach is going to evacuate everything. Even the thought of eating the rest is making me feel sick 




-----

Pretty much how it goes. I can't stand it, and it's not like I'm nauseous from being overly full and pushing myself and eating past my limit. I've felt that, and this isn't it. This is something different; stomach is still growling and the thought of eating more of that specific food is out of the question, unless I feel like vomiting (side note. I've never eaten further once I feel like this, therefore I've never actually vomited from this feeling. But sure as hell feels like I'm teetering right on the edge)


Out of the last decade or so, I can say with confidence that these are the foods that will do it to me without fail, and how much... 

- Brownies after like 2-3 (which sucks because I love them) 

- a certain weed gummy/edible I got. Only after 1. And yet I love gummy bears so it's not the texture 

- Standard Oreos, after about 2

- All vanilla Oreos, after about 1

- Crunch Chocolate Bar, after about 1/4 of it

- Hershey Kisses, after 1-2 (not a big deal. Don't care for them) 

- Many different kinds of protein bars, this one discovered right now. A Birthday Cake flavor from Pure Protein, I can eat like 60% of it, as I said



There's a few more, but that's all that comes to mind at the moment. I am not a big sweets person, but figured maybe I might be lactose intolerant, if that's causing it? A lot of those things have milk chocolate. But that's weird because I love milk and can put away a 16oz glass daily without any problems whatsoever. And I love other kinds of like ice cream and some desserts, but it's only the above that do it. 


Any ideas what the hell is wrong with me? At first I thought when I was young and noticing this, it was all in my head. But it's persisted, and it's not like how when you drink nothing but a certain alcohol in college, you can't stand the stuff now. Most of these foods I don't eat at all, and they just cause this sensation. Plus, some of it is even food I enjoy.




Annnyaay, just curious for some input. This recent one now, with the Birthday Cake Protein Bar was pretty bad. Just thinking about it right now makes me feel like I'm a second away from a dry heave, so I figured I'd ask about it for the first time. I'd be happy to answer any questions too.

3 days ago a hole appeared on my right tonsil, a painful lump on my throat/jaw (gland area) and pain in my ear in the same side. 

I have attached pictures of yesterday and today, it is larger and I am in more pain today. 

I am prone to tonsillitis but no symptoms and I had COVID (mild) about a month ago.

**TLDR AT BOTTOM**

For the last few months I’ve had discharge (sometimes yellowish and smells very bad but recently it has been more white and not much of a bad odour) under my foreskin and I’ve seen that it comes out of my urethra. I clean my penis daily (including pulling foreskin back to clean underneath - no soap, just water) but it seems to come and go at random times. The head of my penis becomes irritated and dry/peeling skin and will sometimes be a little more red/purple on the area that is most irritated. If, for whatever reason, I haven’t managed to shower for one day, it will become very irritated and discharge will start leaking from the urethra. The same seems to happens hours or a day after masturbation. I’ve had this problem for a couple years now (it didn’t occur too often) and I just assumed I was prone to yeast infections due to tight-ish foreskin but it seems to be happening very often now. Head of penis also gets very dry at times and I have to wash away dead skin that’s peeling (the actual head under foreskin). My foreskin is quite tight when the penis is erect but fine when soft.
I haven’t had sexual intercourse in about 10 months so I don’t think it’s an STI - I also had tests for chlamydia and gonorhea when this first started happening a couple years ago, of which both came back negative. I live in a very small town where most doctors know me personally so I’m kinda hesitant to talk to one of them about this. I’ve been feeling very anxious thinking that I’ve left it too long now and I’m just going to have to suffer the long term effects (if any) 

Could it be an STI from years ago that’s been left untreated? Maybe prone to yeast infections? Or perhaps it’s due to my foreskin being slightly tighter than normal while wearing tight underwear 24/7? 

At home treatments would be great but if I really have to see a doctor I will.

TLDR; penis discharge and irritation under foreskin for years, happens a lot now more than ever - used to be more yellow with foul odour, now more white with odour not as bad. penis head gets irritated, dry and thin layers of skin peeling. Clean penis daily, if not cleaned for one day there will be lots of discharge and irritation. Not sexually active for approx 10 months. Masturbation causes discharge and irritation the next day. 
Possible STI from years ago untreated? Prone to yeast infections? Caused my tight foreskin + tight underwear?

What is the difference? How can you tell? My SO was diagnosed with Bipolar and is currently taking Lamictal and Gabapentin, I’m not sure it’s doing her much good though, even though it seemed to be when she first started (6 months ago). Anyhow I’ve done a lot of research on her disorder to better know her condition and be able to mitigate her mood swings/hallucinations. Anyhow after researching I think that she was misdiagnosed and that she actually has BPD. Come to find out two of her family members were previously diagnosed with BPD. Looking for some ways to spot the difference/broach the potential misdiagnosis to her. She thinks she’s doing better but is far from it, although in her defense she just started a new job for the first time in a long time and has been burning the wick at both ends.

I have constantly gotten sore throats all my life. At age 4, I had tubes put it and adenoids removed due to constant ear infections but my parents opted against removal of the tonsils. I curse them all the time for this. 

I've had tonsillitis, kissing tonsils, tonsil stones, you name it, I've had it. Recently however, due to my toddler being put in daycare, the sicknesses are doubling. Last year I was sick roughly 7 times always with painful sore throats, swollen tonsils covered in white streaks and what feels like phlegm down my throat. During these, I'm constantly waking up gagging and easily I'm sick for 7+ days. 

Currently I'm on day 5 of yet another tonsil sore throat bout, this time with fever. My daughter is getting her tonsils taken out (due to sleep obstructive disorder) and when asking about potentially getting them myself, was strongly advised not to. Something about it being much more dangerous for an older individual. Two more doctors confirmed this but no one has offered an alternative.

OK onto the fun part, 
I woke up yesterday morning, went to my computer, I took a small sip of water, and proceeded to break out in hives across my face and neck.  
I was alarmed because I haven’t had hives since I was a small child around six or seven, so I called in a virtual visit with a Doctor who prescribed me famotidine and Zyrtec. 
I waited all day for the prescription, but the pharmacy wasn’t able to fill it, and then that evening after dinner, I started breaking out in hives again, but this time there was some throat involvement, and I was wheezing so based on the suggestion of the e-doc I went to the ER. 
The hospital was packed and after waiting two hours to be seen, the attack subsided, and I decided to go home. 
This morning I feel mostly fine, but my face is slightly inflamed, and my skin feels super sensitive, as if I have a sunburn almost. 

Before y’all ask: no new lotions, laundry, detergents, face washes, makeups, or medications. 

I called my family doctor and I’m waiting for a callback to make an appointment hopefully today but he’s not super familiar with EDS/HSD things, so I figured I’d ask here

Started with strange neck pain and mild temperature spikes along with body aches and fatigue about two months ago. I failed three Covid tests so I went to my PCP and he said it was a virus. Weeks later I was severely congested, and presented with metallic and aggressive salty taste in mouth. Went to an ENT and was given a z pack for a sinus infection. It didn’t do anything so he sent me for x rays that came back normal. He told me to reach out to my PCP. It has now been two months and I am suffering from EXTREME salty taste in my mouth, post nasal drip, head congestion, headaches, shortness of breath when exercising (or even walking my dog), dry eyes, and fatigue. Body temperature is okay and energy throughout the day is up and down. 

I’m feeling foggy and intensely nervous because my cognitive abilities seem off. I don’t know if it’s the congestion or if I’m suffering from something more severe or if it’s just health anxiety.  This salty taste is driving me crazy.

Backstory: I had a UTI in September 2021 that never went away with short term antibiotics. I was referred to a urologist who put me on Cefalexin for 3 months.

After this time, I felt so much better! Until February 2023 - when I tested positive for another UTI which came out of nowhere. I took nitrofaruntoin which felt like it worked. 

Now over a month later April 2023 - I have tested positive for another UTI but have had lingering on &amp; off symptoms for the last 2 weeks. 

I am now being prescribed Cefalexin for 5 days as this did seem to work back when I saw my urologist. 

My question is, is Cefalexin likely to work again? Or because I took it for so long, is it likely that the bacteria has become resistant?

- Blood spots (purpura?) - twice behind left knee, twice on left and petechiae once on upper arm, once left hand  
- Small indentation in left upper thigh, feels as though muscle is missing 
- Random bruising   

Other:

I also have the Kyleena IUD in situ, short of acting as contraception it’s done nothing to slow my periods down. 

I’ve been on the norethisterone for 6 weeks - I bled for 2 weeks, then stopped for 1 week, and have started again, this time for 3 weeks with no sign it will stop soon. 

Other meds: apixaban 5mg BD, venlefaxine 300mg, propanolol 20mg BD, aripiprazole 15mg, gabapentin 600mg, Metformin 850mg BD, mirtazepine 15mg.

311,AskDocs," 

39F, 5'7"", 128lbs, white. Generally really healthy honestly. Never smoked, social drinker, and I walk 6-7 miles every day.

**Existing diagnoses:** OCD, anxiety, depression

**Current Medication:** Xanax 0.25 - 0.5mg as needed (not taken often)

**Complaint:** Sleep issues and night sweats for 3 straight months, every night. The sweats *always* accompany a wake-up from extremely vivid dreams, though they are not nightmares. I will sleep for 3-4 hours, then wake up from a dream with the backs of my legs dripping with sweat. This will continue with me falling into another vivid dream and waking up with legs sweating about an hour later.. goes on until the morning.

I'm not drenching the bed and it is ONLY the back of my legs my legs and knee pits that sweat. After a full night of 'episodes' the sheets under my legs will be a little damp, but my pajama shorts and underwear are mostly dry. My head, armpits, shirt, etc... are all dry.

**Other Info:** The sleep problems started 2 weeks after I recovered from a fairly mild Covid infection (my first one ever). It was also during a period of extremely crushing stress and anxiety about some other issues that are still ongoing, but even when I go to bed NOT feeling anxious, the vivid dreams and leg sweats still show up.

I realize I'm almost 40 so perimenopause isn't off the table, though I'll mention that my periods are regular and normal and I've had no obvious changes to my cycle during all of this.

**Tests I've Had:**

\- Brain MRI with IAC, with and without contrast, 2 weeks ago. Results were normal. This was not done because of the sweats, but because of some longstanding tinnitus and lingering dizziness from a vestibular neuritis years ago. Covid worsened both of those symptoms and it worried me.

\- Hearing test and tympanometry. Results normal. This was also done for the symptoms above, not for the sweats.

\- Blood tests (CBC, TSH, liver and kidney, fasted glucose). All normal except my WBC was 3.6 (ref range started at 3.8 or 4). Doctor told me not to worry at all about it since I don't get sick frequently or contract infections.

\- Vestibular testing. This revealed a 'weakness' in my right ear that uncovered what my doctor thinks is leftover from an old vestibular neuritis from a couple of violent vertigo attacks I had years ago (I've had intermittent mild rocking dizziness since then, but it got way worse after Covid).

\- I've taken my temperature during several of the sweaty-dream wake-ups and it is always normal, around 97.4 which is my norm. So I don't think I'm spiking fevers during the night.

\- I don't have any swollen lymph nodes in my neck, collarbone area, or groin.

**What's Been Tried:**

So my doctor thinks that because I had the worsening tinnitus/dizziness as well as loss of taste/smell for 2 weeks from Covid, that it's likely it also messed with something neurologically and is causing these lingering sleep problems. He thinks through habituation to the tinnitus, physical therapy to get me back to my normal for the dizziness, and just... time... things will improve with my sleep as well. He thinks it may be a form of long Covid, but he's just guessing of course.

My psychiatrist, of course, thinks it's all anxiety (and yes, my anxiety HAS been chronically high for a long time now) and put me on a low dose of Amitriptyline at bed to help with sleep and ""dry me out"" but it did nothing.

**Overall Question:**

So obviously, you Google 'night sweats' and get a lot of scary stuff. I'm sick of seeing doctors over this and my other issues and really would like to get back to my life and see if, with time, it will stop.

My question... is it safe to do that? With my specific symptoms and the tests I've had done so far, should I just put this to rest, work on lowering my anxiety, and try to move on? Did COVID maybe do something to my ANS? Or should I be seeking other tests?

Recently it came back, I applied it with Bepanthen gel and it got better. Completely dissapeared. But yesterday I went into the salty water and the same evening it came back with vengeance.

I will apply the gel again, but is it common for salt water to cause it overnight? Even though it was gone totally?

320,AskDocs,"After being on NHS waiting lists on and off for years, I am desperate for answers. Whilst on a walk in 2018, I suddenly started to feel a severe cramping pain in my calves which caused me to stop walking. Over the past five years, the calf pain has persisted and become more frequent, in addition to hip and buttocks pain and weakness and weakness in my arms. This is now seriously affecting my quality of life, and I struggle to walk and leave the house because of the pain.

I’ve been seen in orthopaedics, as spinal stenosis was initially suspected, but that was ruled out. I’ve now been referred to the neuromuscular clinic and have had my initial appointment. An EMG and nerve conduction study show myopathy, but no nerve issues. Blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers, but normal creatine kinase levels.

These issues have put my life on hold - I’ve had to temporarily leave university, and I’m currently unemployed, as I can barely walk for 30 seconds without being in severe pain. Due to the current situation with our national health service, I have to wait months in between appointments, and I’m receiving no answers as to what the cause could be. Due to this, I’ve started to do my own research.

Looking back at my medical records, I was prescribed asthma inhalers for suspected asthma around a month before the symptoms started. I didn’t find these to be particularly helpful, so I did not continue with treatment. 

After reading some articles in medical journals, I became aware of steroid induced myopathy. Could this be what is causing my symptoms? I’m unsure, as from what I’ve read, the symptoms usually stop after steroid use has stopped.

I’d be extremely grateful for any advice or answers as to what could be causing my symptoms, thank you!

324,AskDocs,"It started roughly two weeks ago, when I was exercising. I was adequately warmed up, and was lifting heavy working on a leg press machine. I was in the middle of a set when I experienced an intense heat and then uncomfortable, constant and dull pain. It almost felt like my neck was locked up and I needed to stretch it. I immediately stopped my set, and started rolling and massaging my neck. I don’t recall any light headedness or spotty vision, just the pain in my neck/base of my head. After the pain subsided a little, I took it easy and finished my workout. The rest of the day I felt sick, almost as if I was on the verge of vomiting. The next day I woke up feeling completely fine, I was able to workout without any issues.

Fast forward a week, I am warming up to reset my 1RM bench press, when I experience the same pain. At that time in my workout I was still warming up and lifting what I normally lift, it started off extremely mild but then grew to the same pain as the previous week. I eventually called off my workout and went home, I decided to take the week off from working out, and get some rest hoping whatever was going on would pass. I didn’t experience the same, sick/nauseous feeling as I did the last time though. 

Which brings us to today. I took last week off so I’m in the gym warming up, taking it easy to get back into the groove, and I can feel it creeping in. About my second set in, it hits me, same persistent and dull pain, same spot, and it seems to only affect me while working out. I’ve tried my best to look online, but the best I have been able to find is a tension headache, but I don’t feel it anywhere but the back of my head and neck. 

Unfortunately for me, I don’t have any medical insurance and can’t afford medical bills at the moment, so going to the doctors is more than likely out of the questions. I’m not on any prescribed/non-prescribed medications, I take Centrum, magnesium citrate, magnesium glycinate, CLA1000 and Triple Omega almost daily.

The left hand side pain (most prevalent in hip and shoulder, radiating all down and up through the left side) has been slowly getting worse for a while. Bounced between several specialists with no definitive answers (one mentioning fibromyalgia but not being sure). Had done physical therapy at one point though more for the neck/shoulder portion which seemed to make the issue worse. 

Spine and neck looked fine on imaging. 

Now, recently dealing with lots of lower back pain issues at night along with the last couple weeks of not feeling like my food is fully getting digested. Had a bug about a month ago (seemingly) which led to my first vomiting in almost 3 decades, but seemed to recover but now waves of nausea returning without any real reason. 

I’m seeming to be somewhat regular still, though perhaps smaller than normal and only after some warm drinks. 

After eating last night (including a few sweets, which obviously I regret now) my whole body is in extreme pain since then - massive headache, abdominal pain, lower back pain, pins and needles throughout body, etc. I do have a cold, but some of this still was there before that came on.

331,AskDocs,"Hello. I am 32M, 176cm height, weight 76kg, from Norway. Currently on Vyvanse (50mg morning + 30mg afternoon). I was born with 2 heart problems, 1 of them was a hole between the heart chambers which was operated and fixed before i turned 1 years old. The other heart problem was linked to the main artery (i think) and from what i understand it was in an ackward position that could potentionally be an issue later (where it would potenationaly block itself from what i understood). However I was being checked up on it atleast once a year until i was about 16, and they then told me that it would not be any issues with it. This has also been checked almost every year in recent years also, and they say its not any issues with it.

About 1-2 years ago I struggled with what I am pretty sure was health anxiety. Almost everyday for a while I felt discomfort in left chest around the heart area, I also felt it to be dificult to breath sometimes and  a few times when it happened I also experienced issues to swallow water and would have to spit it out. In the period this happened I visited doctors alot to find out what was wrong, I generally thought it was something wrong with my heart or something else. Everytime they checked me they never found anything, I was even sent to the hospital a few times where they would run even more tests, but never find anything wrong. After a while this happened less often and I kind of almost forgot about it, how it used to be such a big issue for me. 

About 9 months ago i was also diagnosed with ADHD and started medication for it (vyvanse). I did start to have some issues with this again then, i had to stop the medication for a while because of it, but after reading abit about acid reflux and asking my doctor about it (did not run any tests though) I started up using somac and I could start using vyvanse again. I stil experienced the issues sometimes, but I would normally just skip my afternoon dosage those days. It was stil an issue sometimes, but nothing like it was 1-2 years ago. I did not feel the need to call the doctor about it anymore. I have been on that dosage for about 6 months now.  


A few days ago I suddenly started feeling dizzy when working from my computer. I decided to check my blood pressure, it was a little bit high, but could probably link it to being abit stressed. However i noticed my heart rate was at around 170BPM and I had just been working from my computer all day. I  decided to wait a bit and check it again, and it was stil as high, even though i felt calm. I decided to call the ER and ask them about it. They told me to come down for check so I did. The HR was about the same when arriving there and them running tests. It got down to around 130ish while being there, and they decided to send me to a hospital for some more checks. They did some bloodtests, EKG and checked my bloodpressure there. They also did something im not to sure off to lower bloodpressure, and it seemed to work after a few hours since it was down to 90-100bpms. They did not find anything wrong, so they told me I could go home.

The next day I was working again from my computer and I suddenly started feeling a pressure from the left side of the chest / heart area. I also started feeling really dizzy and suddenly i noticed I could not move my left arm. When this happened I paniced as I felt something terrible could happen (or atleast that i was about to faint), So i stood up and walked towards the door. After a bit I could move my left arm again, I would stil however feel the pressure from left chest. Also my left arm would feel drained of blood, I got the feeling like if I would work out the arm really hard and its tired and my fingers / left hand would feel really cold, while my right hand felt normal. I called the ER again, was told to come down, was sent to hospital again, where I did the same checks, only difference was that they also did ultrasound and took bloodpressure on both arms this time and also legs.   
Again they found nothing wrong with me and told me after a while I could go home.  


after this has happened I have taken down my vyvanse dosage to 30mg in morning and nothing afternoon. This is just because I felt the vyvanse could be related to the issues im having now since i got theese issues both at around 3-4 hours after taking my morning dosage. Just to clarify, when asking the doctors about this they have said they do not think its any issues with me taking vyvanse.   
The issue with this for me though, is that I get obviously alot less effect with the 30mg dosage im currently on, and im to afraid to up the dosage again.

&amp;#x200B;

Close to everyday since that last episode I have felt some discomfort in the heart area and also my left arm feels like it has bad blood circulation (feels like I have been working out the left arm alot and feels tired/numb) while also the fingers on left hand is alot colder than the right hand. This always seems to happen 3-4 hours after I take my morning dosage of vyvanse and lasts for a few hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did a endoscopy with biopsies. Came back negative for h pylori, coelakie, gardia.

I keep asking for a CT scan but they don’t want to give it to me bc apparently everything is fine but i feel anything but fine.

about 2-3 months ago my lips, and sometimes under my eyes, started swelling out of nowhere. In the beginning it was like 1-2 times a month, then it got more frequent and now it comes out nearly every day.

When I start feeling the swelling I take a Xyzal which usually helps, it stops the swelling. 

Last night my face got very itchy and it started to swell, but only on the right part. I took a Xyzal, the itching stopped and it swelled a little more. I went to sleep and this morning I woke up and my eye is even more swelled than before, and my face is the same as when I took the Xyzal. I am a little concerned that the Xyzal didn’t really help, and my mother suggested that we should go to the ER so they can give me hydrocortisone.

My family doctor think it’s allergies, I went to a doctor and they are doing tests right now, but I will get the results only in May.

I also have a very stressful period right now, and I noticed that when I’m stressed this swelling comes more often. For example, I was on a little trip this weekend, which was very relaxing, and I didn’t have a single issue. As I got home yesterday and started to worry and stress about my everyday things, the swelling started.",t2_fn0uuzpe,0,should i go to the ER?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12pa22w,True,eseuag,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12pa22w/should_i_go_to_the_er/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12pa22w/should_i_go_to_the_er/,475433,1681725031,0,,False,1681725042,1681725042,2023-04-17 09:50:31,,,
337,AskDocs,"Hi, I'm a female on my twenties, normal weight and currently not taking any medication. I had a mole in my belly in about 2018 and I noticed in 2021 by looking at pictures that it went from about 2 mm to 5 mm. The mole is dark brown, I'm pale and had about two sunburns a few years ago

I know it doesn't make sense but now after about three years I remembered it and I'm panicking. I have a dermatologist appointment in a month. I spent the weekend looking at images and reading stories, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I'm so angry with myself for ignoring this. I can't find any mole similar to this that is benign. Every story I read about people not doing anything about a growing mole for years are stories about stage four melanoma. I could live a normal life and I ignored it and now it's possibly nothing to do. It's possibly spread in many organs now. I looked at hundreds of images and read so many stories about stage three or four melanoma with no symptoms. While I wait for the appointment can I ask my gp for a ct scan to know how much it spread? What ct scan to order? Any idea?

My sleep is terrible, I'm tired all the time but when I try to sleep I randomly wake up in the night because I feel like I can't breathe but I was told everything was anxiety before my POTS diagnosis.

I've upgraded from a fitbit charge which also showed low o2 in the night down to 80% but I assumed it wasn't accurate although since getting the Samsung Galaxy 5 Pro it's showing worse readings and says my o2 is under 90% most nights. It said last night my sats ranged from 70% to 99% and was under 90% for 2 hours or so.

How accurate is it? I am being investigated for sleep apnea or issues because I'm constantly waking up because i feel like i cant breathe but just wondered how much I can rely on the data from the watch? 

It seems pretty accurate for HR for keeping an eye on my POTS though. I did send this to my GP and they want to see me today but should I be worried or are these things not truly accurate for things like o2?

Since mid February i have been experiencing some weird symptoms. 

It started with a uncomfortable feeling in the middle of my abdomen. Then that feeling moved up in my upper middle abdomen. I then felt bloated, constipated, my throat feels really tight and i have a white tongue at the back with white spots that doesn’t come off and a stiff neck.

(Negative for H Pylori, negative for coelakie, negative for gardia). I did bloodwork that came back fine. I did another bloodtest friday and suddenly my ferritin is extremly low (4). My doctors keep brushing me off but i’m convinced it is stomach cancer. They don’t want to do any tests anymore. All my symptoms just scream stomach cancer. I don’t have a family history of stomach cancer but i’m afraid i have the CDH1 gene that i didn’t even know of or something. Does anyone know what further tests i should do.

In the beginning of this year I went to the doctor because I had a big painful nodule and I the doctor said I had bartholinitis and prescribed and antibiotic.

It happens that I didn't really take it. I can't swallow pills and they were big. I tried but I couldn't and eventually it went away. 

But since then I've been having little nodules now and then. They're like little pimples but they don't have any white head, they don't hurt when I pee. They only hurt and itch at certain positions, like when I had the big one back in the beginning of the year. 

Two weeks ago I had one really itchy on the left side. It disappeared. Yesterday I found another one in the right side. Today I have the one that was in the left side again. Today I even feel itchy in the entrance of the vagina.

About a year ago, I changed my diet, mainly consuming steak, salad, and coffee. Two weeks into this diet, I experienced a sudden improvement in cognitive function, feeling like waking up from a coma. I regained imagination, verbal fluency, mathematical ability, and my depth perception improved significantly. This improvement lasted for a few weeks.

However, since then, I've occasionally felt ""normal"" for a few hours, but mostly, I'm back to my impaired state. I've consulted with multiple doctors, but none have been able to identify the cause. I have also undergone multiple blood tests, including a hormone panel, full blood work, folate, and homocysteine test (which was low normal). Still waiting waiting on cortisol results.

My hip and back feels like a pinched nerve, but my tailbone and my side is more like a throbbing pain. I cant lay down, stand or sit without it hurting so bad. Nothing helps. Advil, narcos, steroids. I’ve been stretching and seeing a chiropractor for a month now but it’s only made it worse. I went to the ER this morning because I just can’t deal anymore and the dr told me that they can’t do anything unless I’m dying. They gave me a shot in the muscle and sent me home. That didn’t even help either. I’ve become depressed due to this never ending pain, I can’t do much anymore because of it. Can all this pain really just be sciatic pain? No medical issues other than being constipated on and off for a year now. Waiting for a referral to go through to see a GI specialist. I have not been in any accident to have caused pain.

I should note I did an MRI last week, and it turns out I have a 1cm complex septated cyst on my left ovary. ever since then, my periods have become A LOT more painful (crippling), and I am also experiencing pain and crippling bloating during ovulation. \*is this due to infection, or something else?\*",t2_9c7k2wqht,0,Did my (30F) gynae cause my bacterial vaginosis infection to get worse?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12p7usz,True,Terrible_Lecture994,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12p7usz/did_my_30f_gynae_cause_my_bacterial_vaginosis/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12p7usz/did_my_30f_gynae_cause_my_bacterial_vaginosis/,475419,1681719560,0,,False,1681719576,1681719577,2023-04-17 08:19:20,,,

371,AskDocs,"I'm male 18, height 5'7, weight 68 kg, no medical conditions. 

The problem that I'm facing is a form of OAB (overactive bladder), which according to my doctor was caused by my usage of antidepressants. 

● Symptoms&gt;&gt;
Urinary frequency like every 30 mins and lots of pain in pubic region and lower back, if I try to hold it in. 

● For more context&gt;&gt;

▪︎ I have been on antidepressants since, I was 14 right upto 17. From 2019 to 2022. 

▪︎ The OAB symptoms started around 2020, when I was 15 years old. 

▪︎ The symptoms kept getting worse progressively, even after I went off the meds. 

▪︎ I still have the symptoms and they make me wanna end it all. 

▪︎ I have already visited countless doctors but non of them could help that's why I'm resorting to the internet as a last ditch effort 

Ofcourse the antidepressants gave me other issues too, but that's not the topic of this post.


● How the OAB works 

It is caused by the antidepressants messing around with the neurotransmitters of the brain which causes changes in bladder functionality,  this makes it hard for the bladder to expand and increase in volume when urine fills it up. 

So instead of peeing once every 6 or 7 hours and releasing a decent amount of urine. I release only small amounts through out the day causing frequency in urination and pain.

I just want to know, if I tested negative for surface antigens, is there any possibility that I could infect my partner? Like maybe the virus exists in my body but can’t do anything to me (but can be spread), and that’s why it’s not being detected? Or maybe the test measures infection and not viral presence/the term “non-reactive” doesn’t mean “negative”?

378,AskDocs,"Hello, my girlfriend (27F, approximately 5’6” and 235lbs—up from about 145-150lbs pre-pregnancy, no current medications, and non-smoker) and I have a question but she does not use Reddit. She approved me to post here asking for possible explanation(s). 
So my girlfriend is pregnant and just was in the ED for suspected aspiration of stomach contents in her sleep. While in the ED she had some labs run, one of which was her blood glucose level. Today she had a bowl of sugary cereal but it was at least 8 hours prior to labs, and she ate a banana on the way to the hospital. Her glucose came back at 140. Fast forward and we get sent to L&amp;D because the OB was concerned with some of her other symptoms. My girlfriend and I missed her last OB appointment where they intended to do a glucose tolerance test to check for gestational diabetes, so the OB decided to do it while she was in L&amp;D tonight. Before this test, I had brought back food from Qdoba (the doc had yet to bring up that she wanted to do this test or else I wouldn’t have brought food back), and she had to drink that sugary drink of course. Her lab results took like 2 hours—twice the time they took to get back while in the ED—and her glucose came back at exactly the same level: 140. 

We are wondering if anyone can possibly explain why the same lab might possibly get EXACTLY the same glucose level so far apart with all the ingested carbs in between?

383,AskDocs,"Hello there,

Very concerned son here, my father will be resting and then his heart rate pings to maximum for no reason, around 170'ish.

He doesn't smoke or drink

He is 16 stone and only 5 ft 9
(212 lbs and 175cm)
54 years old

This started a few days ago, he has had pins and needles, numbness in arms, squeezing in his neck and pain in his jaw and chest, all classic heart attack warnings.

These episodes are typically occurring once every ten to twenty minutes currently, and they can last anywhere between five seconds and around thirty seconds. 

The heart misses a beat on his ECG trace and then reverts back to normal speed (around 70) during these episodes, his Oxygen saturation drops to around 93 while being normal at 99 when at normal 70bpm...

He is currently in A&amp;E but they seem stumped. 

His troponin levels are ""less than 5"" from his bloods, which they tell me, means he has had no damaging cardiac events.

They administered morphine (I told them he doesn't need it as he's not in pain), they said it would help as it's a vasodilator (never heard of morphine being used as a vasodilator before). This was very bad, caused my dad a lot of chest pain and he had 30 of these pinging attacks in the course of 10 minutes after administration, I was distraught as knew this was correlated, all the nurses were barking at me, including the doctor, that it was not correlated, when I said, it quite obviously was. I have told my dad to avoid all opiates, codeine, morphine, paracetamol as a result. He had Aspirin which he has been okay with. 

My family are preparing to go private treatment to get him an angiogram with contrast ASAP

Can anyone please tell me / have a guess what the issue is with my dad's heart? Faulty note in need of a pacemaker? Arterial narrowing requiring a stent?

I was trying to get enough greens in my diet so I purchased this Spring Mix greens from the store. It says washed and ready to eat so I didn’t bother washing it. I have been eating it since 3 days now. Today while munching on it I noticed some small black spots on the leaves. I took a closer look at it and some of them seemed to be moving. I immediately was shocked. I didn’t eat the leaf that was infested but I imagine I must have eaten some other leaves infesting with it already? 

Are they gonna infest inside my body? Can they turn into worms and eat through my organs? Should I go to the ER? Please help I’m freaking out right now!

I had a running workout on Wednesday and ever since then, my left thigh has been hurting. I will try my best to describe pain as I myself cannot pinpoint the muscle that hurts.

When I am laying or resting, my inner left leg feels fine but there is a slight tingly sensation on my upper thigh (nothing crazy however). 

Walking also isn’t a huge problem, as I can walk comfortable other the maybe occasional pain (but nothing that isn’t manageable).

Hello all, my doctor prescribed me 10mg Valium to take an hour before my IUD insertion appointment on Thursday morning. Trouble is, I just read online that you’re not supposed to drink alcohol til many (unclear how many) days after you took the Valium. 

This weekend (Friday night til Sunday night) I’m attending the biggest event of my year (a 2 day festival which I’m very excited about) and I was hoping to drink heavily with friends. 

What are your opinions? Can I drink at the festival I’m going to, or do I need to stay sober?

401,AskDocs,"23F, 5’6, 132 lb, no medical history, used to smoke/drink till last year September-not anymore.

I went to an ENT last evening for a blocked ear. He cleaned both the ears and then when he checked my nose he said he sees something that shouldn't be there- a particle/obstruction. He said it looks to be superficial so ill just take it out since it doesn't look good and isn't supposed to be there. I asked if there was a scan i could get done to see it or something, since i didn't have any symptoms or anything and just wanted confirmation. He said a scan is no use because i can see it right there. He took out one piece (hard, bone like). But, after that he said there seem to be more such pieces inside and i will need to take out all of them right now. So i asked if this can wait, since i had gone alone, for a different complaint, and the first time he took whatever that thing was out, fairly hurt. But he said no this is an emergency and i need to do this right now. So i said okay, let me just call my mother or someone then. He said fine but please hurry because we close in 5 minutes (??!!) Anyway mother came and he continued to poke around my nose for a good 30-45 minutes, taking out similar bits and pieces. It hurt and was uncomfortable. He said if it was a kid we'd do this under GA and if he cant reach the foreign object this way we will also have to ' under GA. After it was finished, he checked wit V endoscope and said i dont see any more particles but im advising CT with contrast (of paranasal sinuses) and another endoscopy after 2 days to look for more. He prescribed antibiotics, paracetamol, oxymetazoline spray and anti allergic.
Said come after the CT.
My question is - is this usual/normal/ethical? Because it feels like a big deal but he didnt act like it is, proceeded to remove the stones then and there.
Im not very comfortable right now, unsure of if i did the right thing letting him do that? And in your opinion, is a CT with contrast necessary?

I've been on acertil and a beta blocker since then to lower heart rate and blood pressure in an attempt to create an idea situation for recovery. I also have PVCs now, seemingly as a result of the myocarditis. My cardiac function has been described as ""significantly impaired"". I am not overweight, but I am fairly sedentary, especially after the diagnosis. I get 7000-10k steps every day as a result of my job, but no other exercise.

Even though it's been 8 months, I still regularly have shortness of breath and mild chest pain (1 or 2 out of 10), whether I've taken the medication or not. I am waiting on a beta blocker refill today and my heart rate has hovered around 100 all day. I've gone back to the cardiologist several times both for normal follow-ups and when I have the recurring symptoms, but every time they say everything appears normal on the ECG and biomarker tests.

Should I be concerned? Everything I read leads me to believe I should be recovered by now. Should I seek a second opinion?

403,AskDocs,"18, female. Some years ago, when i was around 14, this thing came out my lower side. This is the only picture i have of it: https://imgur.com/a/wJ8yVMI
It was as hard as a rock and small. I do not drink or smoke and didn't take any medication at the time. I do have some acne on my back, chest, arms, and face that was worse at the time.
It all started with what i assumed to be a mosquito bite because it was itchy. It was on my lower left side, close to my back. Eventually it grew inflamed and swelled up a bit. I couldn't sleep on that side because it hurt when i layed on it. Slowly the swelling and pain died down and the skin on top gradually thinned out. I had a feeling i could squeeze on it to get something out but i refrained from doing so. I did go to a doctor who did an ultrasound scan on it but couldn't find anything. Before i managed to get an appointment with another doctor, i scratched my side and accidentally scratched that thin skin, causing a small rip. Some runny pus came out and my mother decided to just squeeze on it. After a bit of squeezing, this black and white pearl/bead looking thing just popped out of it. She made sure to get all the pus out, cleaned the area, and then put a bandage on it for the bleeding. Then i just kinda forgot about it and randomly remembered it again today. As of now it has not returned and i just have a small unnoticeable scar there. If i press my finger on it i can feel a small dent.

414,AskDocs,"My pelvic floor is failing at 19


I'm 19M, no drinks or drugs, 173cm or 5'8, don't know weight but I'm skinny, no meds, 2 years ago since 2020 maybe 2019. Caucasian.

2 years ago I started having pain in the perineum area, then came hourglassing in the penis everytime I was semi erect.

I'm a chronic masturbator, which is embarrassing to say the least. 

Nowadays I can't take a shit or pee, I have Ed, and hourglassing in semi erect form everytime, penis is almost always in hard flaccid state.

Peeing is difficult, the stream is weak and it never gets all the way unless I massage the perineum, taking a shit is the worst part because I automatically clench or Kegel without wanting to, it also makes my symptoms 10x worse.

The hourglassing is really bad aswell, if it's cold outside it gets worse.

I do have a small bend while erect and it started 8 months ago it gets better if I don't hourglass that day. So I'm guessing I also have peyronies at 19.

I have ejaculation issues aswell, retrograde ejaculation, spasms, weak stream.

It's getting way worse, and before my symptoms were sometimes but now it's everyday. It's causing me depression.

Exercising and stretching helps a lot in minimizing the symptoms but i don't know what stretches to do, and I only do sit and reach which helps a lot.
In my opinion I think peyronies with hard flaccid, pelvic floor dysfunction.

I might need surgery because it looks pretty severe.

The cause is from laziness, overmasturbating, sitting all day, less exercises, weak pelvic floor.

Please help, what could it be??

&amp;#x200B;

20M, 6ft 115lbs. I am not taking any medication currently. I suffer from Osteoporosis and some digestive diseases. I am just trying to get some opinions on what may be going on with my left bicep. I noticed about a week ago this twitching that I think has happened before but not very long ago and definitely not this consistent. It really was acting up so I recorded it, thinking if it keeps up I'll say something next time I see my GP. Since that one night spasm this twitching has not let up, it's happening very frequently now. it's just like my muscle is spasming and twitching like it's being shocked but it in no way feels like a cramp.

&amp;#x200B;

The night of the twitching that really made me notice this I had some whole body weakness, was dragging my feet in the store and felt like I was going to faint. Was super weak and slurry. I had eaten not very long before this so I knew it wasn't lack of food. Not sure if related but figured id mention it.

Hello doctors,

I have had shoulder/scapular pain for four years now in the same spot. The main pain spot is under my scapula but it’s basically affected my entire left arm.

I’ve massaged the it  (massage gun, lacrosse ball.) tried chiropractic adjustment, physical therapy, medicine, nothing helps. 

It makes my entire left arm feel like I’m losing mobility and ROM.

I can’t lift much at all with the left arm anymore. It’s a sharp pain every-time. I have constant shooting pain from around the location to my fingers and elbow and to the front of my collar bone up into my neck. It almost feels like nerve pain? and it drives me insane on a daily basis. 

My left hand is always clenched. 

subconsciously or contorted in weird ways (two fingers bent, the rest sticking straight out.) to try to mitigate the pain maybe ? but nothing helps. I have to actively try to release my hand from clenching. 

I can’t even push my shoulder blade back the same as the other side without feeling searing pain and very, very limited rom. 

There is a very clear snapping or popping noise you can hear when I roll the shoulder back. It almost feels as though my shoulder blade is like fused to my back and I’m ripping it or something the ROM is so bad.

Lifting my arm above my head is a struggle, causes lots of pain in the front of the shoulder area. Bending down causes extreme discomfort shooting in the scapular area. I went to the doctor for this two years ago and they did a MRI of my spine which came back fine (I guess to check for a pinched nerve?) and flexion and extension of my spine (?). 

No imaging has been done of my back or shoulder. Besides unrelated whole body PET scan for another issue entirely but was clear in my shoulder. They ended up giving me a injection in my bursa of my shoulder which helped slightly? but the pain returned soon after. Like within a week. When the area is pressed under my scapula I feel insane tension and pain in the front of my shoulder (next to collarbone). 

The tension in my neck sometimes feels so intense it hurts to swallow and speak. Like I’m fighting to swallow. There is also a pretty small knot in the same side in my neck that is numb and causes discomfort when pressed. That definitely could be unrelated though. 

I am at a loss . I thought this would eventually subside but it hasn’t and I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’ve been dealing with this for four years. Ive had no bad injuries to memory that could’ve triggered this. 

I’ve tried physical therapy. Insurance refused to let me do more . I still do the exercises. but I feel like something was missed somewhere and something is WRONG. I refuse to believe this is normal and I cannot imagine living in pain like this for the rest of my life and being productive. This is affecting my quality of life tremendously. 

What could this be? What can I do from here? Should I go back to my PCP? A specialist?

Male, 31 Years old, Asian, 148 lbs, 5 feet 9 inch, currently on medication for insomnia

So i have been 6 months having insomnia. It was started at sunday night, September 25th. As usual, I slept the whole day during sunday. I felt normal until I was about to sleep at the middle of the night. I suddenly couldn't sleep. I kept trying but it only increased my anxiety.  So, I spent sunday night sleepless
Monday September 26th I go to the psychiatrist. She told me that I have Generalized anxiety disorder and she gave me clobazam and fluoxetine. However, they didn't work well. Then, I go to an  internist doctor. He gave me a cocktail that consists of 4 or 5 medicines. It helped me sleep for about a month. However, my wife suggested me to go to the psychiatrist instead depending on the cocktail from an internist doctor. So, I went to the psychiatrist. He gave me cocktail consists of aripiprazole, hexymer, lorazepam and chlorpromazine. It worked wonderfully for about 2-3 months. Then something strange happened. When I was napping, I felt a searing headache that made me woke up from my nap. After that headache, I couldnt take a nap until now. I asked my psychiatrist but he didnt know what caused my headache and inability to take a nap. He just gave me the same cocktail. I could sleep fairly well at night but I couldnt take a nap, which made me frustrated because I love napping.

Sxs all started this morning, first with urinary retention. I noticed that it felt like I wasn't able to fully evacuate my bladder and that I could go again more often than usual. My flow would take a couple seconds to pick up as it usually does then suddenly stop, there is some sharp pain when flow stops. No noticeable blood in urine.

Gradual onset of low back aches, not super painful. Later in the evening right after flow was suddenly stopped, I noticed bright drops of blood, though previous urine (during same evacuation) had no blood. Eventually noticed a blood clot was passed. Since then, all evacuations have had some mild blood/clots at the end of urination. 

Currently have a low low grade fever, 99.5, but I've never had fevers in my adult life, can't even remember the last time I had one when I was a kid. Also have chills and body aches, more specifically neck, low back, and legs. Still does not hurt when peeing, just when it forcefully stops. 

No history of UTI which is why I'm asking reddit. I do plan to go to UC tomorrow morning if sxs persist, just wanted to get some thoughts now.

I just got over a bad cold that lasted over a week, which was the week before this past one - the usual head cold symptoms like sniffling/congestion/coughing/sore throat, you get the picture. The coughing got pretty deep feeling and gross/gurgly, but my lungs still sounded clear. I had lingering congestion this past week, plus a slightly lingering cough, but nothing serious. Went back to work with a mask. Had tested negative for COVID several times at home. 
  
Yesterday I had a bit of a dry cough still, just a tickle in my throat. Today a bit of the same, but nowhere near the level of coughing that I did over the sick week. Yet, I’ve had increasing chest pain today when I breathe and it has kind of crept up on my right neck side too? Again, I know it’s probably nothing… but I’m just a tiny bit freaked out because I currently have slightly higher cholesterol (~208 at last test, so just over the level) and my dad has had two heart attacks even though he’s a healthy dude, so it runs in the family. 
  
The pain isn’t super noticeable when I’m not breathing, but I immediately feel it if I take even a small breath. As I type this out, yeah, it’s sounding like it’s just chest pain from coughing - I’m just surprised it’s hit so late. If it sounds like it could actually be an issue, though, don’t hesitate to let me know.

440,AskDocs,"Hello, I've been having pain in my upper left arm for the last couple of days. I think some information that may be relevant is that in December 20th of 2022 I got COVID for the first time after successfully avoiding it since the beginning. At the time of getting COVID, I had every vaccine except for the most recent booster. Ever since then I've been having some issues that I believe are my heart. I went to my PCP about it January 3rd because I had recently lost a lot of weight and believed my issues with extremely high heartrate jumps and other issues like feeling dizzy, fatigued, and just generally more tired had to do with my Lithium levels and thyroid levels being off. It was not, as all of my blood tests were normal.

I still struggled with increased brain fog, muscle weakness, increased tremors (even more than before--A side effect of lithium, which is why I was worried about toxicity when I went in initially), intermittent palpitations, and more anxiety. I usually walk down the street to my PCP so I did this time as well, but when I did it was a lot harder than usual. I felt faint, and it was hard to see because the lights around me had the astigmatism effect it usually does without glasses. The doctor sent me home and told me to come back for a follow up if it didn't get better and to use a watch tracker to track my heartrate.

I did, and I didn't like the results whatsoever, so I went back February 21st. The symptoms stayed, even sometimes getting worse than it was before, so I went back for another appointment and I brought my app and showed the doctor how my heartrate would jump 20-30bpm just from standing up or walking up or down the stairs, and how I had an average resting heart rate of 50-56, which previously wasn't an issue whatsoever. I'm on the spectrum and I used to pace for hours on end back and forth just as a stimming motion, but now I struggle to stay standing without feeling out of breath very fast. She had a nurse do a test where I lay down on my back, then sit up, and then stand, checking my heartrate for each inbetween. My heartrate went from 52 laying to 73 sitting to 93 standing, so she had an EKG done and a blood draw.

My blood draw was okay, but the EKG showed signs of Bradycardia, so she ordered a 3 day heart monitor to be shipped to me. I wore it and sent it back, and according to my PCP it was okay and that was good for me, which i found to be kind of frustrating because even though it was good that the tests were okay, it meant that something was wrong and I still didn't have an answer. She sent me back home and told me to come back again if it continues to be an issue, and I haven't gone back since, but I have continued to have the symptoms, and even have almost passed out a couple of times. These past couple of days I've been having pain in my upper left arm that isn't consistent with any movements I could have done to pull a muscle, and google keeps scaring me with heart attack lingo, so I thought I would come here where actual doctors are with more information so I don't give myself panic attacks.

I truly don't mean to fear monger about COVID or the vaccines, I'm just confused and concerned due to the timeline of things and want to make sure I lay down any and all possibilities. The only other thing that I could think of is that I had a tubal litigation where the entirety of my tubes were pulled out November 28th, but the OBGYN checked the three holes and has deemed them healed correctly and healthily. I will say that my OBGYN also did a blood test just to check me for PCOS because I have a lot of the hallmark symptoms, but I overslept past the telehealth appointment covering the results due to how my sleep schedule has been messed up from the chronic fatigue, so all I have to go off of until the rescheduled appointment in July is the MyChart results, which I am not confident in reading because I'm not a doctor.

The results were basically all flagged except for T4 FREE, Testosterone, and Prolactin. A lot of the results were just slightly off so I'm not even sure if it's something to worry about or just a bad day for testing these things, but my TSH w/FT4 Reflex &amp; Hemoglobin were marked as low, whereas my LDL Cholesterol was near optimal (103 when the range wanted is listed as  *&lt;100 mg/dL* ) And my Hematocrit and Abs eos Auto were both marked as high. I have no idea what any of this means. 

I have a sliding hiatal hernia, if that affects anything.

I do not drink or smoke cigs, but I do use marijuana for medical reasons.

I have a history of mental health issues and as such have been on a bunch of different medications throughout my life. Currently I am on a morning med nighttime med schedule.

For my morning meds, This is what I take:

\-Lithium 600mg  
\-Omeprazole 40mg  
\-Buspirone 10mg  
\-Hydroxyzine 100mg

\-Lithium 600mg  
\-Buspirone 10mg

442,AskDocs,"6 doctors and specialists are perplexed - can anyone help me figure out what’s going on?

Over the last three years I’ve been to 18 different Doctors about my symptoms and have always been dismissed until in February after a visit to emergency with what I thought was an allergic reactions. 

I had a low temperature, felt like i was fainting over and over, was disorientated, confused. My limps went really heavy and my hands and feet started tingling and then went numb. My jaw felt paralyzed and i couldnt speak. My blood pressure was low (80/58) and the doctors kept saying it was really optimal. I had a wave of feeling like I was going to throw up and shit myself. When it passed it just couldn’t rest. I couldn’t put my head back- I just kept bobbing a bit back and forth and then I started having hallucinations - just black shapes in my vision - patches of darkness that would move if I moved my eyes. Sometimes Shapes of animals but just usually blobs - I thought I might die I just felt horrendous. The doctors did nothing. They thought I was having anxiety and since I explained I had something I was allergic to they just checked my airways when I first came in and then left me for a couple hours. 

Within about 3 hours I started being able to speak again and regained feeling on my hands and feet. I went to a follow up with my doctor and they did lots of labs and just found a slightly elevated hemocrit and mcv. I asked for my cortisol to be tested. Am cortisol came back at 42 and then 43 - so the doctors said it was slightly low but gave me nothing 

Over the next month I was back at the hospital and emergency multiple times for episodes of the same thing. They started checking my cortisol (not in the hospital when I was presenting with symptoms but the next morning) - it was mostly low but sometimes normal (highest 8am was 330, other results were 63, and 120). 

I also had an mri as they suggested pituitary Adenoma but it came back clear (no contrast) 

I saw a naturopath and requested medication and he gave me 5mg of prednisone per day. I ended up taking a bit more but it helped a lot. 

I then saw an internist who suggested Addison’s. No acth stim test has been scheduled. 

Next I saw an endocrinologist who tested all hormones off medication for 24 hours 

My acth was at 7.5 a few months ago, but is now at 1. Dheas was 2.6. Am cortisol was 180. 

Endocrinology says it’s likely secondary adrenal insufficiency but no known cause. 

In the last 2 years I have gained 60 pounds. I do not eat excessively and I exercise. Lately I have started putting in massive efforts to increase exercise and decrease calories. I eat between 1000 and 1200 calories a day. I weigh my food and calculate everything. I don’t miss my milk in my coffee or any small items. I exercise to burn a minimum of 600 calories per day. I either hike or walk 8km a day or I bike 20. I haven’t missed a day in 4 weeks. I somehow lost ten pounds in the first week and a half and then it’s come back and more since. If I eat any carbs I get extremely bloated and have noticeable fatigue. 

My kidney function tests show gfr of 125. My b12 without supplements was high - 631. I have not taken supplements since November. 

Does anyone have any idea? The doctors are perplexed. I’m happy to post all my labs.

Hello, 
I’m on here with a really embarrassing question. I used to have a normal bowel movement, which for me was 2 times a day and felt satisfied. These past few months I’ve been extremely constipated. It’s hard to poop and when I do it’s skinny and short lived. I remember being in extreme pain 3 months ago and squeezing the biggest poop I’ve ever had and since it’s never been normal again. Even taking laxatives, I never feel satisfied anymore. 
Medication history;
I was on birth control from age 16-19.
I’ve been on Prozac (fluoxetine) 20mg for about a year on and off. My drinking habits became way less and I’ve been vaping less. 
I guess my question is, what could be happening? 
I had a miscarriage recently but I’ve been constipated since before I was even pregnant so I don’t really correlate it.  Could this just have come with age? Is this my new normal?  I eat pretty normal; for the most part. 
Also worth mentioning I’ve had hemorrhoids a handful of times and never got it treated and I’ve found blood on my tp (light) every few months which I suspect is the hemorrhoids. 
My bloodwork’s is always normal as well.

Hello and thank you for taking the time to read. I’m sorry it’s so long but it might help to get a bit of backstory.
This is a throwaway because I don’t really want my personal health info linked back to my account.
Doctors are about a week or two wait and I’m not a fan of hospitals etc. from having to go there quite often.

I have quite a few meds &amp; diagnoses; 

Ritalin IR, cymbalta (duloxetine), Quetiapine &amp; vitamin supplements.

ADHD, Autism, C-PTSD, Anxiety, IBS, very mild asthma, possible PoTS but haven’t been to a cardiologist yet &amp; supposed Elhers Danlos Syndrome.


Last year my gp ordered bloods due to ongoing Malar Rashes and I had a few markers for lupus so I was sent to a rheumatologist who then diagnosed EDS &amp; possible PoTS (was told to visit a cardiologist but forgot).. 
I am extremely flexible and “double jointed” (traits of EDS) but I was also a dancer for a long time.

So I started taking antihistamines, they helped. I only had rashes every once in a while maybe 1-2 weeks. I stopped taking the antihistamine  for who knows what reason, and the rashes seemed to still be under control.


I was prescribed Ritalin in November 2022 but had to stop taking them from around February- end of March due to being pregnant &amp; unsure if I was keeping the baby (probably irrelevant but thought I’d add it in just in case.)
About 3-4 weeks ago I resumed Ritalin after my termination, and was reacting fine up until about a week or so ago when a rash similar to the previous rashes started popping up on my neck as I could feel the Ritalin wearing off. 
But each day the rash is larger, &amp; not always in the same spot. I noticed it was mainly on my chest, neck &amp; hands, not so much face anymore. 

I’ve attached a few photos here:

452,AskDocs,"Chronic nausea please help

Hello, 
I’m a 19 y/o F that’s been dealing with chronic ankle/joint pain for three years. That’s a story for another time (unless you find it relevant). I mention this because I’m taking tons of medication: Gabapentin, Meloxicam, Cabergoline, Wellbutrin, Saxenda injections, and even some antibiotics daily. Last week I followed my usual routine at night taking my meds and (yes I know I’m an idiot) took a hit of my dab pen. It contains synthetic THC (a hybrid of delta 8 or 9 I think). I’ve been smoking since August of 2022 but it’s never in high doses and always on the lowest voltage possible. Up until recently I hadn’t been smoking daily but I succumbed to the stress of school and take 2-3 hits at night a couple of hours before bed. I’d regret it the next morning sometimes and would take it easy that week if necessary. And I know the argument “it’s never happened before” is invalid but I’ve never experienced adverse reactions if there was a significant interactions with all the meds im taking. I thought if it was some sort of withdrawal that it would be over by now. Recently, a family member passed and I haven’t been handling it well. I didn’t smoke my feelings away I was without it for a few days. The day I resumed my routine I had a couple of bad emotional spells of grief and anxiety but nothing I wasn’t already used to at this point. And that night, I took a hit. What followed was a night filled with lightheadedness, nausea, fatigue, chills, headache and vomiting. I did feel a strong headache hours earlier but I didn’t think anything  of it. Since then, everyday is a chance to experience this discomfort. As I type this it’s been about six days. I haven’t smoked but I’ve tried natural remedies, OTC nausea meds, hydrating, and pain killers. It’s interfering with my life and though each day has become a little easier with less “episodes”, it’s still very difficult. I type this as I try not to puke. There’s no chance I’m pregnant and my period actually came four days early a day before this all began. I take my prescription meds and OTC painkillers pretty frequently so I’m worried there’s someone serious damage. Any and all advice would be very helpful.

455,AskDocs,"Neck/Head Pain

Hi, I am a fit/healthy 26 year old male living in Wisconsin. 

Spanning over a year I have had constant neck pain/head pain coming from both sides of my occiputs. I always have a dull pain coming from that area (3). With food or beverage it can get elevated to excruciating pain. (6-8). The food or beverage I ingest differs the amount of pain I am in. The items I flare up the most to are sugars/alcohol/caffeine. It takes about 5 minutes after digestion for pain to elevate. For instance having 1, 12oz beer causes me to have a 2 day hangover. Or a piece of cake has the same effect. 

This started roughly a year ago I was sitting in the office drinking a energy drink when I started to get this bad tingling sensation in my neck which caused great discomfort. Figuring out the energy drink was causing this I cut it out of my “diet”. With that the pain and problems went away. But slowly (over the course of months) one by one different foods and drink have now that same effect mostly being sugars/alcohol/caffeine. The pain I get is very isolated at the left and right occiput. Depending on what I ingest the pain I get might flow down to lower in my neck/back area. When I go to sleep the pain “resets” but I still sit at a 3 in that isolated occiput area…. I can still feel it there kinda thing. My diet is now restricted for the past few months to water and foods that don’t contain sugar or low sugar (red meat). The only thing that’s creates any relief which is very temporary is working out which I do every day. 

I have been to the doctor where they gave me prednisone and muscle relaxers neither created any relief or solutions to my problem. The doctor believes it’s not nerve damage but doesn’t really offer anything else to me but physical therapy. 

I have gone to a chiropractor and that did nothing for me as well. 

Does anyone have any ideas? What should I do next? MRI? I can’t keep living like this.",t2_vm0ec6gq,0,Neck/Head Pain!!

458,AskDocs,"My mom went in for a nerve block procedure to treat severe headaches/migraines. After the 2nd nerve block using bupivocaine (in the head), she started to feel “woozy” and feinted then woke back up for a little and feinted again. Her pulse went to zero and she went into cardiac arrest. It took approximately 15 minutes to get her pulse back where she had no oxygen to the brain. She is practically brain dead now and will be passing away this upcoming week as she is on life support and has not waken up. 

On the way to the hospital, I was able to contact the doctor who performed the procedure and she said that “she did not inject it into the blood” within 30 seconds of our conversation. I thought this was weird and I didn’t know much about bupivocaine until I looked it up and found that if it gets into the blood stream it can cause a series of cardiac and CNS events. I found out yesterday that she told the ICU doctor something along the lines of, even if I injected into the bloodstream, it wasn’t enough bupivocaine to cause this. A neurosurgeon who has used bupivocaine on my mom appears to disagree with this (among others).

Furthermore, medical records show that she told paramedics my mom was having an allergy, which was not true and the doctor had my moms full medical record where she has had bupivocaine many times with no allergy. Paramedics treated her with two dosages of 1mg epinephrine based on an allergic reaction.

Multiple physicians I’ve spoke to says this was LAST (local anesthetic system toxicity). Less than 30 days ago my mom had an EKG that showed no cardiac issues. 

I also found out this clinic did not have an oxygen bag in the room, they did not have epinephrine, they did not have intralipid, and paramedics wrote in their notes that there were no signs of swelling or allergic reaction. 

I believe the doctor killed my mom, is trying to cover up her mistake, and that clinic was grossly unprepared for what happened that day. Doctors at the hospital think we should get an autopsy. In 72 hours of the event, I requested a bupivocaine serum test to see if bupivocaine was in her blood. Physicians told me it might not show but is worth a shot. We get those lab results in tomorrow or Tuesday. 

Can provide more info, but I don’t think my mom should have died that day and this could have been preventable.

26 US Male 216Lbs 5’10. Not on any medications. Have diagnosed General Anxiety, Asthma and most likely undiagnosed tmj and gerd. Went from heavy drinker to social drinker. Social smoker, Also recently(past two months) started exercising and eating better. No history or family history of any heart issues. 

——

My anxiety is hypochondriac and specifically towards heart attacks. 

——-
My lifestyle :

Recently around January my anxiety has started to creep back into my life, but this time along with it came heavier heart palpitations than in previous times of anxiety. Because of that I decided to get healthier eat better and stop drinking so much. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week have lost 10lbs , cut the drinking from 3-5 days a week to strictly only two days. But my palpitations are still persistent and if anything getting worse. And lost my health insurance half a year ago. My resting heart rate is always under 85 but usually rests around 75. And my %SpO2 is always 95+

Symptoms: 
Will have 1-2 palpitations At work (I’m a chef in a stressful kitchen) they feel like my heart skips a beat and takes my breath away. 
If I’m hungover (like today) I’ll have 3-5 and they feel “harder”. Will sometimes get a palpitations when I bend down, laugh to hard or gasp. 

Randomly will Get a sharp or dull pain in my sternum, and at the bottom of the left side of my chest. 

Chest will feel tight and “not right”. 

The question: Do i rush immediately to find health insurance or am I generally “okay” and can continue my search for health insurance at my current pace. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

TLDR: Exercise didn’t make my anxiety feel better and now I have heart palpitations.

I’m 23 years old and have been experiencing unexplained weight gain (25lbs) over the span of 8 months (all my general bloodwork has been normal.) Over the past week, I’ve noticed I have a low exercise tolerance and random heart palpitations throughout the day.

Two night ago, when i was falling asleep, i experienced chest pains and hypnogogic jerks all night. The next day I was still very thirsty, I still had mild, sharp chest pain (especially when I was feeling nervous or surprised)

I eventually went to the ER and got bloodwork, an X ray, and an ECG and was told everything was normal. All the doctor said was that it was likely just chest inflammation, and then he sent me home with some anti inflammatory pills.

I went to my dance recital practice today. The dance wasn’t super energetic, however my heart rate went up to 187 bpm. 

All day I’ve just been feeling lightheaded, off-balance, and thirsty. 

The only medication I take right now is Ritalin (which I haven’t taken since the symptoms started. However, I think I may have accidentally taken a triple dose the other day) and ketorolac prescribed by the ER doctor

474,AskDocs,"Hello. 35F, 160cm, 43kg. No major health issues except for IBS and eczema. I had anal skin tag removal, fissurectomy, and hemorrhoidectomy on 3/29. 

I still have some bleeding and pain with every bowel movement, but I’m recovering well. My bowl movement was especially painful tonight. I was cleaning my bottom and noticed that something was out. I pulled it thinking it was a piece of stool or something I had eaten earlier. I was wrong, and it was stitches. My anus is bleeding, and I’m freaking out. I’m not in a lot of pain. What should I do? My doctor’s office usually takes 48+ hours to get back to me. A picture of what came out is attached below. 

Here’s a part of the surgery report.

“The inflamed hemorrhoids were dissected free, the pedicles transfixed and ligated and hemorrhoid bundles were excised and send for pathology, limiting the excision to the anal canal.”

Hey, I want to make this short. Please do not downvote, I am only asking out of curiosity.

I’ve read that many things, like red meat consumption, lack of sleep causing firstly low meltanonin and secondly, circadian rhythm disruption leads to cancer.

Many students spend all night studying and only getting very few hours of sleep.
Many teens also eat unhealthy food.
Some even smoke, some drink lots of alcohol, I know many people who do.

Many may even have disorders like insomnia, eating disorders making the risk factors extremely common for them. Rarely some nigh travel a lot causing chronic jet lag.

Then I look at the most common in young adult, colon cancer cases, which is also related to the risk factors mentioned above.

https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21772

As it takes 10-15 years to develop, we look at &lt;30 years cases per 100,000. It is 2.5. 

I am highly confused why it is this low when the risk factors mentioned above increase risk by a lot or cause it. 

I know it depends on a lot of factors but I still want to know how it’s 2.5 - so low, and what I’m missing. I’ve also gone into depth seeing the link of disruption in circadian rhythms and cancer and in short it claims that the enzymes created by it get destroyed by disruption which leads to abnormal cell generation, resistance to aptosis (which kills abnormal cells to protect us) etc.

487,AskDocs,"Hi there - 21NB / AFAB from Australia here, non-smoker. Currently on 10mg of escitalopram daily for anxiety, hasn't effected me since I started taking it a year and a half ago. Haven't been drinking since the headache started as I don't know if that will effect it.

For context, I work a front office job in a school looking at a computer all day, I've had my eyes tested and all was fine. I drink plenty of water and have a regular sleep schedule, 8+ hours a night. My posture isn't the greatest but it is something I regularly try to correct. My mum and my younger brother both have suffered from migraines in the past, but I don't believe that this is comparable to a migraine.

As mentioned in the title, I have had a headache for two months, specifically starting on Sunday the 26th of February. In the first couple of days I thought it was one of my regular headaches, until I came to the realisation that painkillers weren't working. Usually Panadol / Paracetamol helps me within the hour, but it wouldn't go away. I made an appointment with my regular GP and tried different painkillers to see if anything would help but none of them seemed to make a difference.

My doctor prescribed me amitriptyline and told me to come back in 4 weeks, 4 weeks later I'm back and it's done absolutely nothing. She refers me for a CT scan which I had last Wednesday. I've just seen her this morning and nothing showed up on the scan. And she put me back on the amitriptyline even though I told her it did absolutely nothing for me last time, and recommended a massage. Come back in four weeks!

Honestly, after that I went home to my mum and just cried. I'm so frustrated and I'm in so much pain that it's just getting ridiculous at this point. I'm booked in to see an Osteo on Wednesday to see if that helps with anything, but right now I just want answers. I'm so sick of being in pain. Don't get me wrong - I'm glad nothing showed up on the CT but honestly I would have preferred if something did just so I could have something to pin it on.

My question is - what should I do at this point? Should I give the amitriptyline another shot? I honestly don't think I can handle another month of this at this point, I'm so frustrated and just want answers.

I've almost stopped eating entirely. Its too uncomfortable. My throat is always sore, scratchy, and swollen.  My eyes hurt, my nose hurts, my lips hurt, my butthole is in terrible shape. I'm losing all my physical conditioning. My joints are in terrible shape. Everytime, literally every single time I stand up I get so dizzy I feel like I'll pass out. I need to lean on things.

502,AskDocs,"I have a love/hate relationship with how we can see our test results before speaking with the doctor. 

Anyone know what an “adnexal hypodensity” is or could be? Had a CT scan yesterday as requested by my gastreonologist to check for bowel obstruction, and within the notes are a “left adnexal hypodensity at 2.2x3.5cm.”  On previous scans, whenever I’ve had ovarian cysts they’re labeled as such, and this scan also noted bilateral kidney cysts. What is the difference between an ovarian cyst and adnexal hypodensity?

I was diagnosed with endo ~14 years ago (31 now) and was feeling great with 2020 surgery and the right hormonal treatment from last October until about February. My symptoms seemed to be GI related (severely constipated so was attributing pain to that) but now I’m worried endo may be causing issues again. I’m receiving a colonoscopy in a couple of weeks for the GI issues and to rule out adhesions. I’ve had these results sent to my gynecologist as well. 

I’m a bit confused by the language and Google seems vague - appreciate any insight!

I did not have an erection before this, only a slight sensation in the penis before, but that was because I was nervous at the time. I had also just finished pooping before I went to pee, could I have accidentally stimulated myself by doing that?Could this have been semen that just leaked out?

At the age of 21 I started having extreme upper abdomen pain, had an ultrasound &amp; they discovered gallstones &amp; what they thought was a pancreatic cyst. Went to a CT scan to confirm, ended up I had multiple enlarged lymph-nodes around my aorta in my stomach, so I was scheduled for a biopsy same day, Dr really thought it would be lymphoma, biopsy came back benign, so I had a series of PET scans to see if the lymph-nodes grew, they grew less than a centimeter in a 2 month span. After another biopsy, the results showed reactive follicular hyperplasia, my dr also suspected I had an auto immune disease. Shortly after these results I lost my insurance so I was unable to look into this more. Can anyone explain what Reactive Follicular Hyperplasia is? Google doesn’t say much &amp; I’ve always wondered what it actually is. I was told it wasn’t cancer but I was going to be referred to an oncologist?

Got but/stung on the top of my foot. 
Got a horrendous blister, perfectly cicular filled with what I can only describe as blister fluid appear on my foot with a weird looking bright yellow blob/egg thing perfectly in the centre of it. The egg thing had a short tether back into the top of my foot. It would move around freely floating in the blister.
The blister was very inflamed rising off my foot by a good couple of millimeters. The egg thing in the centre was no more than a few mm. The whole blister was around an inch or two at most but covered a good portion of the top of my foot.
The sack has since popped and left skin exposed underneath, as if a regular blister would. The yellow egg thing nowhere to be seen.

this is my third time posting about this but i haven’t been able to get a response and im starting to freak out about this and i really need help. basically, i’ve had a flu since monday. my symptoms are manageable, and rn im just dealing with a sore throat, dry cough and phlegm. however, about 3 days ago, i suddenly woke up feeling unusually weak and faint, dizzy even. it was very strange as i had never felt this way before. it feels like im not in my own body and generally just out of it. no matter what i eat (i have a healthy diet) and how much i sleep (my sleeping habits are ok, some days i do get less sleep than what i’d like) i still feel the same. 

i went to a doctor, and my blood pressure and temperature were all fine. the doctor just brushed it off as me recovering from my flu and told me to stay hydrated and rest more. but nothing seems to be working. i don’t feel nauseous, and everything else seems ok, just that i’m very dizzy and sometimes have a slight headache but that’s about it. i can still walk ok, but this feeling is really freaking me out and i don’t know if it’s something serious like vertigo or i don’t know what else. can someone please please help me out here, and maybe even give some advice on how to feel better? 

some additional info that may help is that i haven’t been exercising recently, which is out of the norm for me as i’m usually a very active person. i have been spending most of my time lying down due to my flu. but even then, back when i was sick before, i have never felt like this. this dizziness is really unusual for me and i would really like some reassurance. i’ve been panicking and my anxiety has worsened my worry to the point of crying. i don’t know what’s wrong with me",t2_58q28lruo,0,"sudden and prolonged dizziness, extremely anxious and worried please help",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12ozq02,True,duwukiyo29,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12ozq02/sudden_and_prolonged_dizziness_extremely_anxious/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12ozq02/sudden_and_prolonged_dizziness_extremely_anxious/,475368,1681700942,0,,False,1681700955,1681700956,2023-04-17 03:09:02,,,

I started experiencing temple pain with a pulse for the first time ever about a month ago my younger sister told me it sounds like tension headaches and not to worry but then I started experiencing thudding in my ears. I’ve also been experiencing extreme dizziness. However, I’ve been diagnosed with benign vertigo the only reason this concerned me is because I haven’t had a dizzy episode since last summer and it just started again with all these new things going on. Should this be anything to be worried about. These symptoms did start after I started new medicine synthroid 50 mcg and norethindrone birth control for pcos but I’m not sure if the medicine would cause these symptoms. I have high blood pressure but it’s controlled as far as I know with lisinopril 5mg.

518,AskDocs,"Hi there. 

This post is about my daughter. She's female, aged 5, turning 6 in two months, mixed race caucasian/black, 38lbs. 

She takes no medication. She has a medical history of epilepsy (in remission for three years), and autism level 2. Previously medicated with Keppra.

Tonight my daughter told me that sometimes she feels ""water drops"" on her skin. With questioning she informed me of the following: 

- the sensation happens both inside and outside the house 
- the ""water drops"" happen on the inside of her right arm, near the inside elbow.  Always in the same area.
- she's never actually SEEN water drops on her arm when she feels this sensation.
- it happens frequently (happened today, while playing outside with her brothers, although she thought maybe today a bubble could have landed on her. They were blowing bubbles) 
- the water drop doesn't ""move"" anywhere, it stays in the same place when it happens.

Her hypothesis is that there's tiny holes in the ceiling that we can't see, and sometimes they must drip water on her. 

Obviously I'll be making a doctors appointment. But I'm wondering If anyone has any idea what this could be? And if I should be calling her pediatrician or her neurologist?

History of Septic Shock, Cardiac Arrest, Liver and Kidney failure, High blood pressure, disseminated histoplasmosis, Bilateral toe amputations in February (everything besides the toes happened in November).

So I was taking amlodipine 5mg in the morning until about mid-February because my mom said it’s probably fine to stop taking if it makes me dizzy when I stand, which was my complaint. Anyways since then my BP has averaged 127/77, usually a bit high like that. I assumed since it didn’t interfere with daily life, that I was fine. I started gabapentin mid-March, which then I experienced episodes of very low BP randomly. This happens rarely as I’ve gotten used to it. I was not taking the amlodipine during this time. I also had a scope (down my throat, idk what it’s called) for my stomach, which I also did not  take the amlodipine (if that matters idk I was put under and was fine). When I initially got discharged from the Hospital, I was told if the top number was above 120 to take it. But it makes me dizzy…

Anyways, I found out having High BP can damage your organs? My organs are already damaged from failures during Septic Shock. Am I damaging them further? Should I take the amlodipine if it makes me dizzy? Would it be okay to take at night instead? Does it have a bad interaction with any night meds? I usually take my BP in the morning; morning BP was 127/77 as usual, was sitting up in a chair using cuff that goes around wrist, I took my BP tonight just because and it was 136/81, my HR is usually 100b but when I took it tonight it was 75bpm.

I plan to call my doctor tomorrow, but I just hope to calm my mind for the night over this…I’m only 21, I don’t want to lower my life expectancy more than the septic shock (caused by my former doctor ignoring me) probably did…

I have eczema, autism, adhd, and other unrelated mental disorders. I have reactions to certain soaps especially, so I use hypoallergenic soaps.

This has been happening basically my entire life. Completely randomly, some random patch of skin, usually on my limbs, especially my legs, becomes very itchy, burning, and peppered with little red spots. The skin also becomes ""fragile"" in a way, as just normal scratching leads it to peel off in little patches. I can scratch a non itchy part of my body much harder than I do the itchy ones, but the itchy ones will be the ones to flake off. Those scab up after some time, usually overnight. 

Notably, the same area does not continue to be itchy after some time has passed. The scabs disappear, I forget about it, until a new area of skin decides to itch and the cycle repeats. I've looked all over to try to figure out what this is, but I genuinely don't understand. If it's eczema, I don't get it, because my eczema flare ups usually happen on my hands and my elbows, and they stay itchy for weeks or months without treatment. I have other itchy patches of skin such as on my arms or on my chest that I scratch a lot, but those never peel off in the way the weird red spotted ones do.

These rashes have happened my entire life, I have no idea what triggers them, and usually occur without any warning. I'll just be itching a scratch I have and boom, stinging pain, and I've suddenly itched the skin away.

Hearing is limited from my right ear through all of this.

I decided emergency room was the next step. While at the emergency room my ear started to pop, fizzle and ooze out a clear reddish fluid.

About 4 yrs ago I started having mild to severe cramps in my lower legs and feet. My electrolytes were measured and were normal. Hormone bloodwork revealed estrogen deficiency. My OBGYN put me on norethindrone and the cramps stopped. 

Recently had surgery and needed to come off the norethindrone for about a month. The cramps came back with a vengeance, now mostly in the groin/adductor and so severe that bruises bloom the next day (both legs). I was able to go back on the norethindrone in early March. The cramps went away for a few weeks but came back this past week.

Now, it’s important to say that due to the surgery I had, I am on cyclobenzaprine. So I am super worried that these cramps are even happening. I’m still on norethindrone as well. Also, these cramps coincide with my menstrual cycle. 

I have an appt with my dr but not until Thurs. I also take daily calcium and magnesium. I drink tons of water and I swim and stretch regularly (I’m even in PT right now from surgery). I’ve been drinking juices with potassium since I’m allergic to bananas.

537,AskDocs,"For some backround information, I'm 27F and caught what I think was covid last October. (Was directly exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid, the PCR tests I took were negative but it got me to a hospital as my asthma became uncontrollable. The flu has never done this to me). 4 Lymph nodes in my neck haven't gone down since then. I recently went to a doctor for this who ordered an ultrasound, and after receiving those results ordered a CT scan.

I got the CT scan with and without iodine contrast, and I had insane light sensitivity and irritability that night. The emotional sensitivity sets in almost immediately after getting the scan. I ovulated about a week later and I was SEVERELY irritable, which is abnormal for me. ( I have been tracking my period and ovulation intensely for the past year since I've been trying to conceive) Normally, ovulation has me social and chatty and generally happy. This time I was down, sad, extremely irritable, and had no sex drive.  
It's been another two weeks and I have been consistently extremely emotionally sensitive. Normally this would happen a couple days before my period starts. It has been like this my whole cycle. To the point where I am having very dark thoughts about myself which is not typical for me. I'm a generally happy and optimistic person.

My resting heart rate has gone up considerably as well. When sleeping and awake, it is steady at 85-95. Vaccuming will get it up to around 115. I am generally healthy and exercise 2 times a week. My watch has been tracking my heartrate and its gone up about 10 bpm on average.

The CT Scan found a 3mm fat containing lesion on my left thyroid gland centrally and several swollen lymph nodes, the largest being 1.9x1x1 cm level 2 node.

I have a feeling the contrast material is the reasoning behind all these sudden changes. I haven't been able to find any information online confirming or denying if this is typical for a response to a CT scan.

The bloodwork that I had done before the ultrasound was virtually perfect, my doctor said I had ""beautiful labs"", the key items being I had high eosinophils (\~600), slightly low MCH, and a TSH of 3.25. Everything else was within range. This blood test did not include any T3 T4 or any other thyroid related panels.  


I have an appointment with a hematologist/oncologist next Monday, but I have been severely anxious about all this and I am trying to find any information that could help me cope with the anxieties. I'm not normally an anxious person so I am afraid that whatever is causing my hormonal issues is also responsible for my sudden anxiety.

I guess my key questions are: Is contrast material known to cause hormonal changes or mood issues?

Hello everyone, i am a 20f and I know the answer to the question is probably no but I just want a peace of mind because I don’t want to end up being told I have MRSA, Staph tomorrow when I can get immediate treatment tonight. I made an appointment with an urgent care tomorrow morning as all of them are closed right now. Basically the last 4 days I have had weird, red, itchy, “things” show up on my leg, ankle, and feet (and a single one on my pinky) I say “things” because they are not bump like, but also not flat. They are very, VERY itchy and red. In some places, like my ankle, are swollen because of them. At first I thought they were bug bites, but I have never seen or felt any bugs on me nevertheless anything biting me. In one of the photos, you will see a rash looking mark. This was the first one I experienced and my skin feels very tight to the touch around it. They don’t feel like hives, and this has been going on for about 3-4 days. I’ve tried to soothe them with alcohol, anti itch cream, etc… but nothing seems to work to make them better. I’m kind of freaking out and panicky because I genuinely don’t know if this is serious or not. I’m skeptical of it being an allergic reaction as nothing in my life, daily routine, food habits, etc.. has changed

Can’t get answers - any thoughts?

Ever since March 21, about once every seven to 10 days, I get a very full feeling in my left nostril/sinus. When I blow my nose, first comes the thick golden clear mucus…almost like honey, followed by a lot of watery yellow ish drainage. It happened again today - most of the day I had pain in my left sinus above my left eye.

I have a severely deviated septum. I went to ENT on Friday and they did a scope and saw nothing abnormal. Otherwise healthy, no fever, cough, sore throat.

It’s very unnerving when it happens and unpredictable. Doesn’t happen because of a specific position or exertion. And the watery fluid is a little shocking. After it clears out it stops, but I’m sure in a number of days it’ll happen again.

ENT thinks it’s just allergies but I’ve never experienced anything like this before in my 36 years of having a deviated septum. 

At first I panicked and thought it was CSF but I’m pretty certain that’s not the case anymore. Although the fluid that comes after the golden/honey mucus, it does stiffen tissues and has a very slight yellow tinge.

I made an appointment with an urgent care tomorrow morning as all of them are closed right now. Basically the last 4 days I have had weird, red, itchy, “things” show up on my leg, ankle, and feet (and a single one on my pinky) I say “things” because they are not bump like, but also not flat. They are very, VERY itchy and red. In some places, like my ankle, are swollen because of them. At first I thought they were bug bites, but I have never seen or felt any bugs on me nevertheless anything biting me. In one of the photos, you will see a rash looking mark. This was the first one I experienced and my skin feels very tight to the touch around it. They don’t feel like hives, and this has been going on for about 3-4 days. I’ve tried to soothe them with alcohol, anti itch cream, etc… but nothing seems to work to make them better. I’m kind of freaking out and panicky because I genuinely don’t know if this is serious or not. I’m skeptical of it being an allergic reaction as nothing in my life, daily routine, food habits, etc.. has changed

547,AskDocs,"(21M) Severe Upper Abdominal Pain After Drinking Soft Drinks/Tea

Hi I’m a 21 year old male. I have a super huge problem when I drink any soft drinks or tea. After drinking tea, soft drinks or anything of that sort. Most alcoholic drinks also tend to cause me this problem as well. I seem to have an intense cramping/pain across the upper part of my abdomen just under my sternum sort of. This pain is like an 8/10 for me and makes me just want to curl up into a ball until it goes away. The pain only lasts for around 20-30 minutes before it finally subsides. Now here is the weird part, this doesn’t happen every time I drink a soft drink or tea, it’s almost sort of random. Some days I can drink 3 sweet teas back to back and be fine. While like tonight I had 3 sips of a coke, I then began to feel the pain coming on. 

I have ruled out food being an issue because if I have a meal with water I am fine. I do have problems with my stomach in general after though such as bloating, constantly changing bowels, greenish poop on occasions, sticky/greasy poop on occasions, etc. 

I am in fairly good shape as well.

I also have moments of light sensitivity and increased bowel movements.
 

My assumption is that I need to change/up my antidepressant dosage but is there anything else I should explore when I see a GP? I've had a history of pregnancy related anemia and low thyroid so I'll ask for those to be checked but is there anything g else that might be happening? It just happened so suddenly, and strongly.

My symptoms include at first not being able to swallow and stomach upset, thought I had some type of GI issue. I went to the er again due to thinking I was dying, thought it was a panic attack. Heart rate and bp were again high 150ish. did chest xray blood work and everything was mostly normal. during all of this i have really fell apart.

5 days ago my body started to itch everywhere. Usually 2 spots are very itchy and if I don't scratch the itch disappears and a new totally random spot starts to itch. If I scratch it gets much worse and the area widens. All I can see when scratching is the area getting red. There is no other visible skin irritation. The sculp is the worst but it appears everywhere. 

This morning was the first time I could find some skin irritation (see [https://ibb.co/QnzGvXj](https://ibb.co/QnzGvXj)). 

I did not change my moisturizer or any other skin product. I moisturize everyday and live a healthy lifestyle (no alcohol, no smoking, regular workout, good diet) maybe stress could be a factor. I am using some medication for muscle spasm, however I take this for 3 weeks now and the itching only appeared last week.

572,AskDocs,"3 month old male fighting sleep &amp; seems very uncomfortable. No medication, no underlying conditions.

Hello! 

I'm writing to get a bit of ease of mind about this. 

My LO (m, 3 months old) has a really difficult time falling and staying asleep. He used to sleep fine during the night and could only contact nap during the day.

Lately he's been extra difficult. Today we spent around 2 hours trying to put him to sleep, and he first slept abou 3 hours, after which he woke up every 30-60 min if he even fell asleep.

I know this seems like a classic sleep regression but he sometimes cries as if he's terrified, doesn't eat as much as before, and tonight he's been a bit warm. No fever though. I only checked his temperature under his armpit (it was a little over 36°).

He was wearing a long sleeve onesie and a sleep sack, but we just changed him to onesie + pyjama + swaddle in case it was too much for him. We're just trying to phase out the swaddle because he might flip over (hasn't done it yet, but not far).

Another thing is that he's  been chewing on his and our hands every time he gets the chance to. Could this also be teething? Isn't it a bit early?

He's otherwise a healthy baby. We're just a bit sleep deprived and concerned about him being warm.",t2_33m99cmp,0,0M very fussy and sleeps very little,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12owuk4,True,andreea_carla_b,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12owuk4/0m_very_fussy_and_sleeps_very_little/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12owuk4/0m_very_fussy_and_sleeps_very_little/,475353,1681695077,0,,False,1681695087,1681695088,2023-04-17 01:31:17,,,
573,AskDocs,"33F 5""2' 100lbs- I wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar experience and what their outcomes were. To preface, I have an urgent referral to a podiatrist already, so I am currently being seen by medical providers.

I broke the distal phalanx of my P4 on my right foot on February 12th by catching it on a piece of furniture. Honestly thought it was a stubbed toe until it didn't stop hurting and my toe swelled up.

Conveniently I am a veterinarian with access to a dental x-ray so I went into work and took some xrays. The full progression can be seen here. Apologies in advance, some of the images could only be uploaded as short videos from my iphone, sorry about that. https://imgur.com/a/PCMGzVW
I had indeed broken my toe. I went to urgent care and they recommend the standard thing - buddy tape, firm shoes, return to activity when it doesnt hurt. Which is exactly what I did. It seemed to be healing quite well (as can be seen in the album) until the middle of week 3 when it suddenly starting feeling worse.

I had been flexing my toe one evening and I worry I may have refractured it somehow. Afterwards the pain got worse in the following week, I felt a strange clicking sensation sometimes (not painful) and I felt like I was regressing. I went to urgent care again and I was basically told the exact same thing, except now they recommended me wearing an orthopedic boot with an inflexible sole. Once I could wear normal shoes again, I should do that and go for a ""tough walk"" as long as I dont experience pain during the walk.

So I did that, I got a post-op shoe and wore that, still felt like my toe was moving around though because the inside of the shoe had padding. At this point I had been taping and untaping my toes for 6 weeks and they starting having a reaction to the tape and all my toes starting getting some swelling. I switched to using vetwrap with some gauze for comfort and I got a carbon fiber insert and a very wide toe box minimalist shoe - which basically made the shoe unable to bend.

Since then I feel like I've stagnated and becoming more and more frustrated. When to my pcp a few days ago who said yea this isn't normal, I'm referring to you to a podiatrist.

I am an avid walker and hiker and my job requires me to be on my feet a lot. I have however, not walked on my toe when it feels painful and I can walk around barefoot without any discomfort. I know this probably comes down to me overusing it before it was truly healed, I am well-aware of that. However, I wanted to see if anyone else has had this happen to them and how it turned out?

I am also vaguely suspicious I may have mild raynaud's syndrome, I've always had very cold toes and fingers and will regularly get chilblains. I'm sure this doesn't help.

A part of me feels like saying whatever, I need to do shit and I'm not letting this take another two months of my life. If I live the rest of my life with a freaky wiggly tip to my P4 I dgaf. I know that this could result in arthritic pain down the line but hell just amputate it because honestly, I dont really need it anyway.",t2_14ht8a,0,Experiences with delayed union of broken toe,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12owtrd,True,SexySmilodon,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12owtrd/experiences_with_delayed_union_of_broken_toe/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12owtrd/experiences_with_delayed_union_of_broken_toe/,475353,1681695037,0,,False,1681695047,1681695048,2023-04-17 01:30:37,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=53e590066b1a7bb6d3535b44a78992347fd5a529', 'width': 960, 'height': 1280}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f41f96042f2619de021149e0990e9db3b0fb0224', 'width': 108, 'height': 144}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f9e384f8235e5a24787a67fe4bac8c55dff08332', 'width': 216, 'height': 288}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af6b54ccaccc4e1845aa5657a9c5c9d7019184e5', 'width': 320, 'height': 426}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a3e895feda48d2d9afc2697f4fb138caf33b209f', 'width': 640, 'height': 853}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/m19TiORbBX4LYntnS2SgDKmSeK1nOziI66ZSfpeMm7Y.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a3e3df4eed46a7bbd66ee2b3d0b08b426cbd2906', 'width': 960, 'height': 1280}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '8H9p6nm-z069UMJ2wzhzCFnX0tRouMJ53Y5BwIsa5Yk'}], 'enabled': False}",

576,AskDocs,"Hello docs! I come with a penile issue. Upon examining my penis this morning, I noticed that there was an atypical swelling on the left side of its neck. There has been an indent here for a while for whenever I am erect, but it seems so… unusually prominent. 

What is worrying me is that on the neck around the same area of swelling is a black spot (a little bit above). I noticed this around November of last year. But since it did not look like it changed after a few weeks, I ignored it and chalked it up to usual penis bullshit.

Maybe I was just more erect than usual due to not having had sex in two weeks, and both the spot and the natural neck both enlarged. Or maybe it was the fact that it was also cold in my room, but I don’t know if that’s important.

The bump looks like a blood vessel, while the spot has a size of about 0.5 cm diameter erect with 0.35 cm diameter flaccid (Not sure if this is larger than before). The latter is also very flat. Not sure if you think the color is off, but it looks uniform.

Docs, is this melanosis? Melanoma? Should I see someone ASAP?

I’m just worried because healthcare isn’t accessible here. I don’t have a clinic I can just access extremely quickly. I live beside a public hospital, but the place is always packed (Third World Country)

582,AskDocs,"23M, 165lbs, 5’11”, Caucasian, no diagnosed ongoing medical conditions. I'm located in Southern California, though I travel to other countries often. Drink infrequently, and haven't smoked in well over 2 years (when it was also infrequent). Currently, I only take 300mg of Gabapentin every night.

For the last year of my life, I’ve had to deal with pain in my throat and esophagus. My harshest symptom is when I swallow - it feels like every muscle in my upper throat is sore when I swallow - it's hard to describe but think of it as a sensation of being choked from the inside out. Every time I swallow. At first it was like this only when I would lay down, but now the symptoms are constant, accompanied by a general feeling of pain/discomfort across my entire esophagus. I made a post with much more detail to this same subreddit about 3 months ago. If anyone has any ideas of what the cause might be, please drop a post there.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a barium swallow test, which came up normal. An upper GI endoscopy (stomach doctor sticking a camera into my stomach through the mouth) turned up normal, which I’m told rules out GERD / LPR / food allergies. A few years ago a dubious sleep study came up normal. I see an ENT as often as I can, but it feels like we’re stuck in this routine of him performing a Laryngoscopy (sticking a camera through my nose to look at my throat / vocal cords) for 15 minutes and telling me he can’t find anything wrong. I’ve taken several types of medication for postnasal drip and GERD, but neither did anything positive. I take benzocaine + menthol throat lozenges, which helped a little at first, but don’t do much now. I take a medium does of Gabapentin to attempt to stave of pain, but it does absolutely nothing. I'm currently pushing my doctor and fighting my insurance to let me try another sleep study and try esophageal manometry.

I'm making this post because my quality of life has absolutely flatlined and I'm desperate. I'm never comfortable. I can't focus because of the pain. I can't easily sleep. I'm pretty sure there aren't enough words in the English language to describe the types of pain I feel. Half of my doctors just think I have anxiety or allergies. Nothing is working. Nothing is even showing that something is wrong, outside of what I'm told is typical inflammation. As I see it, all that's left for me is to either quit my job and study medicine to fix myself, or live in complete physical anguish for the rest of what I will hope to be my short life.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this post is to ask, before that, how I can be as aggressive as possible in treating this with medical professionals. At the current moment, I'm just seeing my ENT every time he can squeeze me in, and every meeting I either get referred to a new type of doctor, or am given a new type of medication. Is there a faster way to go about this? Is there anything I can do to be more persistent and aggressive with treatment? I'm currently on an HMO plan tied to my parents' insurance, and I'm not too familiar with the medical system. I'm willing to drain my bank account and quit my job if need be, so money and time aren't obstacles. Killing the pain I feel every day is my only goal.",t2_f6lmvzze,0,Most Aggressive Treatment Possible,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12owigv,True,Fluid-Art-786,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12owigv/most_aggressive_treatment_possible/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12owigv/most_aggressive_treatment_possible/,475352,1681694381,0,,False,1681694394,1681694394,2023-04-17 01:19:41,,,
583,AskDocs,"I had X-rays taken as well as an MRI. I went through the summaries of each and compiled this list of observations.


Ankylosing Hyperostosis - Forestiers Disease or DISH, per Dr. S, analysis of 2/21/23 x-ray taken at urgent care. Dr. C Orthopedic Surgeon identifies DISH in thoracic spine, calls it extensive, per analysis of new x-ray taken 2/23/23 at his office. (This is an abnormal calcium growth that has fused together all the vertebrae of my thoracic spine. Believe me, I was surprised.)


Moderate multilevel thoracic spondylosis, per Dr. S, analysis of 2/21/23 x-rays. The same Dr. S notes on analysis of 3/9/23 MRI, spondylosis w/o myelopathy or radiculopathy in thoracic region.


Congenital defect in lumbar spine. Four lumbar vertebrae are mobile and L5 is autofused to pelvis via Bartolotta’s Syndrome, per Dr. C analysis of 2/23/23 x-ray taken at his office. Dr. S analysis of same area while interpreting 3/9/23 MRI identifies transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral junction with partial L5 sacralization, conus terminates at L1. (The fifth lumbar vertebrae is malformed and fused to the pelvis. When I asked the ortho surgeon what this really means he said ‘it means you have four bones instead of five’ and moved on. Again, I was shocked to hear this about my spine.)


Moderate to marked degenerative disc disease at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5, per Dr. S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI.


At L1-L2 there’s disc bulging with mild to moderate central canal stenosis. There’s posterior ligamentous hypertrophy and bilateral facet arthropathy. There’s moderate bilateral spondylotic neural foraminal narrowing, per Dr S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI. (While looking at the MRI with the ortho surgeon and observing the disc bulge into the spine’s central canal he said it wasn’t too bad. It didn’t look great to me but he’s the surgeon and I’m not. I was googling the term ‘moderate’ in medical scenarios.)


At L2-L3 there’s disc bulging with mild central canal stenosis. There’s posterior ligamentous hypertrophy and bilateral facet arthropathy. There’s mild bilateral spondylotic neural foraminal narrowing, per Dr. S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI.


L3-L4 has mild asymmetry or scoliosis with very significant facet arthrosis, per Dr. C analysis of 2/23/23 x-ray taken at his office. (Apparently scoliosis and Bertolottas Syndrome travel in pairs. I was told the scoliosis isn’t the cause of any pain.)


At L3-L4 there’s disc bulging with mild central canal stenosis. There’s posterior ligamentous hypertrophy and bilateral facet arthropathy. There’s moderate bilateral spondylotic neural foraminal narrowing, per Dr. S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI.


At L4-L5 there’s disc bulging with mild central canal stenosis. There’s posterior ligamentous hypertrophy and bilateral facet arthropathy. There’s moderate bilateral spondylotic neural foraminal narrowing, per Dr. S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI.


At L5-S1 there’s bilateral facet arthropathy, per Dr. S analysis of 3/9/23 MRI.


I’m pretty sure my insurance is considered bottom of the barrel and wonder what role this plays with the doctors I’ve recently seen. 



The orthopedic surgeon who examined me said that a lot of people who come to see him are hoping to find something majorly wrong with them. I told him I’d settle for being in less pain. My PCP said as long as I can function every day without having to take more than 2-3 pain pills I’ll be okay.


When the pain is present it can be overwhelming and immobilizing. Sudden jabs are the worst. I’ll call out in pain and then be fine a moment later. It feels like being stabbed in the mid back. The orthopedic surgeon said the fused bones in that area aren’t a likely cause of these pains. He said my mid back pains - which radiate to the front through the ribs - are likely lower back related. 


I’ve often got aches and pains and general stiffness in my lower back as I’m aware many people do. I try to avoid heavy lifting and twisting motions but I’m still in low back pain a lot.

The ortho surgeon said I could get injections into my spine to help relieve pain if I was interested. I’m not sticking needles into my spine if I can avoid it. No thanks.

No medications

-lots of random body aches and pains that come and go (all over my body)   
-migraines  
-IBS  

Issue:   
Today I noticed a very small spot on the underside of my breast. It is lighter in color, it has a very weird texture almost like fuzzy carpet. I don’t feel any pain on the skin and there is not a bump (only found it by seeing it). I’ve never had a spot like this before.   

What are the possibilities? Do I need to go to the doctor?  

Possibly related symptoms:  
-I do have chest pains and pain in my breasts sometimes (both breasts have hurt at some point) (many different types of pain, feeling like something in my upper chests/ under-breast area is in the wrong spot or isn’t fitting right, pressure or tightness, sharp stabby pains, dull achy pains that can almost feel like a rod or object, a sort of empty or hollow feeling)   

That may sound very concerning, but I get a lot of random pains all over my body.

Time goes on and it starts… secreting… something that can only be described as deodorant. But here recently (past few months) it has evolved. It bleeds and … juices idk man.

My dad is about 73 and his eyes are really red and very itchy. Not sure what its from, but he believes its from his dorzolamide + timolol (2% / 0.5%). He was okay on it for a while, but now its the way it is in the pictures. Doctor can't think of an alternative for the eye drops. He used to use Timolol at some point instead, but has been on the new drug for a while. The issue started about 2 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The doc thinks its eczema, but the creams didn't work. Any idea what this could be?

I noticed a splinter hemorrhage on my left index finger yesterday morning and thought nothing of it. Another one appeared on my right thumb finger. I also had a momentary chest pain yesterday noontime but other than that, nothing else. I am experiencing a high level of stress and changing my sleep pattern due to work.

I previously had Beau's lines early last month for which I've seen a doctor and run some labs on me (CBC and for some minerals which all came back normal).

I would love to go to a specialist soon but it's a little hard for me rn due to financial and geographical constraints.

I'm currently on an OCP (cyproterone acetate &amp; ethinyl estradiol for my menstrual issues) plus some gastro meds prescribed bt my gastroenterologist (rabeprazole + itopride and rebamipide).

I developed a sudden rash across my nose and cheeks about a week and a half after getting my second vaccination in May 2021. Rash on nose and cheeks in comments and here: https://imgur.com/a/RXkG4fN

Initially it came with additional face swelling, horrible stinging and burning in my nose, and bad headaches + neck pain for about 4-5 months. My nose became swollen/bulbous at the tip and I didn’t see my old nose again. Until…the head pressure got so bad I went to the ER. They pumped me full of a basic IV that had a lot of Benadryl in it. EVERYTHING went away completely for two weeks (and bloodwork they did was normal). I saw my old nose again after almost a year. It was amazing, but as soon as the Benadryl left my system, the rash and nose swelling came back. It’s been slowly improving over time, but the swelling/inflammation and rash only go away with Benadryl. I also have a lot of thick, heavy drainage ever since this started (but I think this could be unrelated as I have food allergies and some reflux).
-ENT said he didn’t know what it could be 
-Dermatologists said it’s rosacea, but when I asked if the Benadryl would make any rosacea outbreak completely go away she said no. 

So, what happened? I am grateful for Benadryl but it makes me pass out and I think it’s really bad my body is in a constant state of inflammation. I assume it’s an immune system thing but what would be the best way to get answers? Something happened or got triggered and I just want to address the problem. I kept waiting thinking it would go away but it hasn’t :/

To start off I got pink eye twice in a row but took antibiotic eye drops to clear it. It went away and a few months later I am now waking up with the most bloodshot eyes I’ve ever seen and eye boogers, not as much as pink eye but still some.

590,AskDocs,"22M 5'8 130 pounds. So this is a two part question. First, is it fine to take expired duloxetine? It's 30mg and it's a year past its expiration date (expired 2022, originally prescribed 2021). The second part of the question is that I wanted to take the duloxetine for venlafaxine withdrawals while tapering off, so how should I go about that? 

I've been on venlafaxine for 4 weeks and am still having bad side effects. I'm only on 25 mg, and I've tried many other antidepressants, but this one has by far had the worst side effects so I want to get off it. The problem is that I'm in the middle of moving, which is why I originally took it, to help with the stress of moving, so I can't see my psychiatrist and don't know when I'll be able to get a new one. On the venlafaxine I just feel constantly wired, but at the same time really tired, dizzy, nauseous, I can't sleep, am having flu-like symptoms where I'm randomly cold, am more anxious than when I started, and am overall just feeling awful. 

One day on week 3 I accidently missed a dose and had panic attacks the whole next day, along with flu like symptoms much worse, and vomiting and shaking. I tried taking clonidine for the panic attacks, and dramamine for the dizziness and nausea, but they did little to help. This is why I wanted to find how I could taper off more easily. 

So I [found this](https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/depression/when-the-medication-wont-let-you-stop/) which says that you can take duloxetine to help with the withdrawals. But I don't know if I can since the duloxetine I have is expired. So if I can take the duloxetine, should I follow this exactly? I don't want to wait 48 hours to take it because of the awful withdrawal symptoms, so I was planning on just replacing the venlafaxine with duloxetine and taking that normally, then getting off that later. Any advice would be appreciated.

Checking it on my Apple Watch it is usually around 80-100 which is normal but for some reason it feels like it’s pounding. I also get what I call hot hands. My hands literally feel like they are burning up. The rest of my body also gets warm. I think it is an increase in blood pressure but I haven’t taken it during these episodes. 

It always happens around the same time (230-300) and wakes me from sleep. When I wear my watch to bed and don’t have these episodes my heart rate does spike at that time.

The results of the test: https://imgur.com/a/9dByo8d (posting this here again to save time on clicking the link to my old post to get to it)

I tested for slightly elevated bilirubin (1.3 mg/dL). My rbcs and platelets also went down, wbc went down slightly but monocyte percentage is at 13%. Albumin and Total Protein went down from upper end of normal to middle range. ALT and AST are only 10 and 14 IU/L respectively.  

Reason why I’m updating is the day after these tests (the 12th/Wednesday) I had a pale/clay colored #2. It continued mostly being like this including today. Today my older brother told me he pooped white today also (he didn’t know I was having this issue also until I told him after he told me this). He doesn’t really have any symptoms beyond mild stomach discomfort and this. I don’t think it’s a coincidence we are getting this symptom at roughly the same time.

Hello! First time posting here, hopefully, this is the right place.

2 months ago, I had ankle arthroscopy to extract broken bone fragments from the joint, along with a cut over the bone on the side, through what I assume is the ATFL, to extract the largest one. Shortly after the surgery found out, they cut what I *assume* is the superficial peroneal nerve. I had sharp electric-like pain, originating from the Anterolateral portal, shooting down my foot, reaching my toes, along with an extremely painful burning sensation, which was permanent during the first 2 weeks. For that initial period, I basically could not touch the lower part of my foot and even touching the soft inside of the orthotic boot was excruciating. Even though the pain and sensations I was feeling were clearly neurological, they denied having cut the nerve for this initial period of time and insisted that we wait until a month has passed and assured me that all of these symptoms would subside. I had to do as much as I could on my own, so I supplemented with the following:  


* **Milgamma® N 40 mg/90 mg/250 micrograms capsules - (Benfotiamine (fat-soluble vitamin В1 derivative)/Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6)/ Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)**
* **Magnesium (although I'm not sure what form)**
* **Omega-3**
* **Raw turmeric root**
* **Raw garlic**

Also did rehab full-time, which included **laser and various electric treatments**.   
At my one-month checkup, the pain in my lower foot had calmed down a bit but the overall situation was still the same and the doctor finally admitted they had probably hit a nerve. I was researching quite a bit and had lots of concerns, such as potential neuroma formation and loss of sensitivity, which they assured me would be fine. He just told me to apply Perskindol Active Gel in the surrounding area and advised me to stop my physical therapy, as it was a 'waste of money', which I didn't as I couldn't even move my foot yet.   
It was evident they weren't going to do much else, so I consulted a neurosurgeon, who advised that any potential surgical intervention might be riskier for the nerve than letting it heal on its own and started me on **NIVALIN - 10 mg tablets (galantamine hydrobromide)**. I have been going to physical therapy 3x/ week throughout the whole 2 months and started taking steps without a crutch 2 days before my 2-month checkup.  


It has now been about 10 days since I started walking and things are not looking great. I had a good couple of days initially, but after starting to work on flexion and extension, I started experiencing sharp, burning pain, similar to a sprained ankle, right beneath the bone on the side and even sitting on a chair is painful and results in swelling. I started wearing my boot while sleeping because I wake up in pain, and I assumed it was something I'm doing while asleep. Taking steps is painful, even keeping my foot down is nearly impossible right now and as of today, I realized that my big and second toes are numb. I have a suspicion that the frozen peas I applied to the swelling might have to do with the numbness because it's right over the same area as the Anterolateral portal, but I can only assume. On top of that, I can now feel a ball formation over the Anterolateral portal itself, which I'm afraid might be a neuroma. This picture illustrates the exact points where my issues are:

I'm at a loss at what to do, I have consulted the allegedly best doctors that we have here, and aside from the neurosurgeon, they are absolutely disinterested in what's happening. I basically get advised to just wait and see. I am hoping you guys might have some input, as I've now consulted with pretty much everyone where I live (it's a small country), and I'm relying on what I can learn on the internet.   
Also, I'm going to start supplementing heavily with vitamins B1, B6, and B12, potentially a B-complex, but studies don't suggest an RDA for nerve regeneration, and as far as I understand dosage is the most important part. If you have any advice on what amounts I should aim for - please do share!

617,AskDocs,"Hi all! I just had my yearly blood work done this last Friday. I was able to access the results that Friday night, but due to the doctors office being closed for the weekend I have not been given a call and I am unable to call yet. I will be seeking advise from my doctor, but I’m having difficulty calming down in the meantime. 

For some background, I am a 24 female. I am a healthy weight and have no chronic health issues I am concerned about. I only currently take combination birth control. I have not been regularly taking vitamin supplements, but have previously taken fish oil and vitamin b supplements. I do take tums fairly often as well, not every single day, but multiple times weekly. My blood pressure, pulse, etc all came up perfectly normal. With regard to my blood work, my triglycerides levels were slightly elevated. That was not very worrying to me, because I did have more fatty and sugary foods for holiday the week prior to this. However, I am very concerned because my doctor ran a Vitamin D 1,25 Dihydroxy levels test and my levels are 112. Reportedly, 19.9-79.3 are considered normal. My calcium levels are 10.2, which is the high end of normal (8.6-10.3). The only other “elevated” was my Albiumin levels which were at 5.0, so high end of normal (3.4-5). 

Does anyone have any ideas on what this may mean? What could be causing this elevation? I try not to be anxious about this, but I tend to worry about anything health related. I am unsure if any related “symptoms” are the result of my anxiety from this, as I tend to have anxiety related difficulties (e.g., stomach aches, nervous bathroom breaks, weight feeling on chest, etc). 

Any thoughts or helpful information would be so greatly appreciate it.

Im seeing an ent and a gastro to help resolve it. Endoscopy confirmed it wasn't celiac or h pilori. Doing a sensor swallow test soon.

 The biggest issue I get is the acid seems to be really irritating my ear tubes, causing tinnitus as well as this sound sometimes when I swallow. The tinnitus gets really bad sometimes and it's effecting my work and sleep. 

Until I get the reflux under control my ent has suggested a couple of procedures that might help in the meantime: stretching them open with balloons and something like damaging my mucous membranes so they produce less.

The thing is I'm not sure how much I trust this doctor. She's part of a huge medical network that always seems to find an excuse to do some new procddure to charge me more. I'm not certain she really thinks this will be helpful and not just looking for another payday.  When it was just blood tests for every possible thing I didn't mind, but this is a surgical procedure with long lasting effects.

I wanted to get a second opinion but every ent in my area has a long waiting list. Hopefully someone here can help.

628,AskDocs,"I (48f) have several things going on medically, so will be happy to expound where necessary.  January of 2020 I had a full hysterectomy due to a 17cm ovarian cyst, never been pregnant. I am very obese, have been overweight most of my life and a combination of genetics, medication, and medical/dental situations have made things…fun. I have lost 30 lbs in the last 6 months and you know the drill. 

Prior to this particular surgery, I was generally cold natured and had always been. About a month before the surgery I had trouble regulating my temperature, but we attributed that to the pain and hormones. The surgery went well, there were issues with pain and I was in the hospital for 4 days, but my organs had been ‘squished’ and had to adjust and the scar goes down my entire abdomen.

Estrogen was started the day I left the hospital. Due to our rural location, my hormone treatment consisted of ‘take a pill or two every day, or every other day depending on how your moods and breast tenderness are’. I felt like I was in a permanent hot flash after the surgery, and we figured it would eventually even out but 3 years later, and I have not worn long pants or sleeves. I keep the house at 63 degrees to sleep, and 68 degrees is hotter than I can handle during the day. Husband wears flannel pants, shirt, sweatshirt, shoes, socks, and a blanket-the man cut fingers off gloves, for crying out loud.

Finally, 6 months ago a hormone blood test showed my estrogen levels at over 2,000 (normal being around 150 I think) and someone recommended the BioTea tablets, so I’m paying out of pocket for those.  However, my ability to be comfortable has never returned, and I guess from some research that this has to do with the hypothalamus being affected by anesthesia? I was hopeful that more exposure to anesthesia would reverse it back, but in 2021 had corrective nasal surgery and since October of last year I’ve had 2 carpel tunnel release and 1 neck and 1 dental surgery.

I have ADHD, hemiplegic migraines and IBS. I had my appendix removed. Lymph nodes permanently swollen for the last 4 years in my neck no idea why but ultrasounds came clear. Non smoker.

I have a 15 minutes call with my gastroenterologist for the first time tomorrow and the onus is on me to ask for what I need (no idea what that might be), he will most likely discharge me if I don't express myself correctly so all pressure is on me.

In August I started violently vomiting after consuming lactose. I used to be lactose intolerant before that and I managed it by having little amount of lactose (butter on my toast) or taking enzymes when I had a slice of pizza. The vomiting came all of the sudden and I ended up in ER 2 times thinking I was having a heart attack. The vomiting happens between 30 minutes and 4 hours after ingesting lactose accompanied by chest pain (feels like I have a heavy stone right in the stomach under the sternum) and upper back pain (feels hot like burning). I get an iritated stomach (stomach pain and heartburn sensation) after fried food or alcohol (after 1 drink). I also have diahreea almost daily and usually need to poop within 30 minutes after a meal. These are all new symptoms. I lost 10 kg since August and I can barely eat plain pasta and toast so I am desperate for help.

10 years ago I had a similar situation where all food was too much and I ate plain pasta and a vegan diet for months until it stopped. At the time my stool was green which is not the case now. Artichoke supplements were recommended to me at the time but I lived in China and that was the norm there. I never returned to drinking alcohol more than 6 or so drinks a year since. 

In March I had an ultrasound and gallstones were found. I also had stool and blood tests done with nothing found, coeliac came back ok and a endoscopy which showed a bit of gastritis but nothing else. 

My gastroenterologist has read the referral made by my GP that did not include all this detail (it noted I vomit after lactose but not the violent nature of my vomiting episodes, I have diahreea more often than before and the test results). Based on that he ordered the tests. Tomorrow is the first (and possibly last call) where he will tell me how he interprets the results and next steps. I was advised by hospital staff that most likely I will be asked to keep a diet for the rest of my life as surgery is rarely offered at my stage given the wait lists are 1+ year long. 

I know to ask for a dietician referral to sort out some food intake but no idea if there's anything else I should consider to ask the doctor (more tests, possible treatment, should I ask if I should just do surgery privetly). If there's anything that pops out to you in here please do let me know. As it stands this is life limiting to such a serious degree that I lost my job and a relationship so I am keen to get it sorted.

Sorry for the long post but, please help. 
This is an undiagnosed nightmare for me. Please excuse my English since my first language is Spanish. I've been having medical issues since the beginning of 2022 and got way worst since June 2022. My symptoms are so many, but my worst ones are Chest pain, feeling of something rushing or running in my chest. Palpitations almost 24/7, chest tightness and cramps. Arm and left leg pains, shortness of breath and many more. Too many ER and Urgent care visits.So many tests done and everything comes back ""fine"" NOTHING that explains my symptoms at all. I now have a cardiologist that believes I have Coronary Microvascular Disease (he's pretty sure about it). After all, finally a doctor that doesn't think I'm making things up and doesn't want to put me on a mental hospital. Doctors have treated me like I'm crazy, like I exaggerate my symptoms, like I have health anxiety to the point that I almost convinced myself too. 

My cardiologist prescribed me something that is supposed to help relax my vessels. It does help but I have SO MANY SYMPTOMS and lately I feel like is not working anymore . The problem is that my cardiologistis is never available,  on an emergency leave or on vacation. I'm getting worst. Is not fun to feel like your having a heart attack each second of your day. Because I don't have an ""official diagnosis"" nobody treats it.

 I've been doing some research and have read somewhere that it is possible to fix ediothelial dysfunction which causes Microvascular disease. My ENT believes I have this due to Covid. She firmly believes I have what they call long covid, which causes dysfunction in the ediothelial cells. I'm just holding some hope. I wish I could have some relief in my life and not to feel like I'm having a heart attack every day. This has changed my life so much, I'm a mom of 4 and I have a special needs daughter that needs me.

Male, 32, 5’8” 170 lbs, no previous medical conditions and no current medications. 

Our dog bit my husbands hand, specifically his thumb joint area, in august. He got antibiotics immediately and all was good. Then a couple of months went by and his thumb got swollen and painful, but by the time he got an appointment with his pcps office the swelling had gone down so they sent him home and told him to come back if it happened again. About three weeks ago it swelled up again. He went to the office and they said “that’s so weird” took an x-ray and sent him home with steroids and said the bone was most likely bruised. He took the steroids for a few days and it got sooo much worse, so he went back. This time they stabbed his thumb and took a culture and scheduled an MRI. The mri showed a bone infection that they’re now saying is serious and he needs immediate surgery or potentially runs the risk of losing his whole thumb. My mother is a medical professional and is appalled that they gave him the steroids at all when it was clearly an infection with a history of a dog bite. She made some calls to get him an appointment at a better hospital in Boston, but it’s out of network. I’m pretty sure his regular office won’t give him a referral for it and our insurance won’t cover the visit/surgery if it’s out of network without a referral. My mom wants us to go to the Boston facility anyway and possibly pursue a malpractice lawsuit to cover the bill. Is that reasonable? We’re not *completely*  poor but we’re definitely not able to afford any more debt or take on any additional bills right now. Neither of us are super comfortable with the idea of legal action but does it seem reasonable? I am a people pleaser and I go to the same office with a different pcp and I love her. I don’t want to ruin a doctors life with something like this. But my husband has this very serious infection now that seems like it could have been a lot less serious if it had been addressed earlier on.

Hi all, some context: I’ve had a swollen salivary gland on the right side of my throat on and off for months now. I’ve been to a few specialists who wrote it off as dehydration/salivary stones, so I decided to finally get an ultrasound for peace of mind. These are the results:

FINDINGS: The right submandibular gland is normal in appearance. No stones are identified. The ducts do not appear dilated. There is a 5 mm well-circumscribed hypoechoic structure adjacent to the gland that could be a small cyst. No Doppler flow is identified. A small hypovascular nodule is also possible. Could consider follow-up ultrasound. Small lymph nodes are identified. There are no pathologically enlarged nodes.

My daughter has celiac disease and so does my wife. We are very careful to never feed her gluten and she is great with her altered diet. 

Today she woke up and ate breakfast (made by my wife) and about an hour later she vomited a lot. She’s been chilling all day and not eating. 

We tried some buttered toast and a few slices of an apple for dinner and she immediately puked it up. 

After reading online, we’re going to try opening a sprite and letting it get decarbonated and drinking that. And maybe trying gluten free saltine crackers when she’s ready to eat again.

So, right after she had both her vaccines, she started feeling really dizzy and nauseas. After the second one, she had to leave work because she said she felt like she was drunk.

It was so bad one time she got admitted into hospital and they thought she had a stroke, but all her tests were normal except her blood pressure was a bit low. 

She’s seen multiple GPs but none of them seem very helpful and they are all very dismissive.

I feel so bad for her as it’s affected her life immensely, she’s not able to work anymore and the episodes keep happening more frequently.

It wasn't until midday today that I noticed it was meant for every twelve, but she's roughly halfway through the bottle.

693,AskDocs,"Hi, and thank you in advance, I don’t know what to do. I am 39F, I had a C-section surgery in 2016 to remove 2 fibroids growing on my uterus and have a scar and scar tissue. Now I have 4-6 more fibroids (I got 3 ultrasounds last week after going to the ER with excruciating pain). It seems one of the fibroids is twisting and degenerating, and bleeding, which was causing the pain. According to the gynecologist specialist, my uterus is 3x the size it should be and the fibroids are 4cms and under. I am small (5’0”, 90 pounds)and very healthy otherwise. They don’t seem to be interfering with any organs or bladder, so that’s good. Since I got back from the hospital I have been bleeding very very dark blood and some debris. The gyno said this is from the fibroid degenerating (my cycle isn’t due for another week). Is this ok?

The options she gave me are to get a hysterectomy (that is a no for me), to have surgery to remove them again (is this safe with all the scar tissue??), or hormone treatment (also a no for me, I have MDD and ocd and cannot handle what the hormones would do to me). I am an American in Tulum Mexico, but I don’t currently have health insurance anywhere. I’m not on any medications. She wanted to charge me $10,000 for the fibroid removal surgery. Note that the healthcare situation in Mexico has been terrifying. One hospital was going to operate to remove my appendix, which was not the issue! 

I know there are other vibrational procedures/treatments that I am much more interested in. Before this I was in California and I did have health insurance but still the cost of these procedures was $15,000 and they did not take insurance. So I’ve been waiting, but I feel like the waiting is over now and if the pain comes back like that I won’t be able to handle it (I’ve had fibroid pain for a decade, this was next level) plus I don’t  know how long I can go / how safe it is for me to be bleeding like this. This is one of my questions, how urgent is this?

My other question is, I have been trying to research these vibrational procedures to see where in the world I could possibly get it that I could afford it, but the names seem to be different everywhere and I am really overwhelmed with all this, plus I have very little energy. How many different procedures like this are there, and what are their names? Is there some kind of resource I haven’t come across that can help me find where I can get them and an approximate cost? Some places I’ve called said they can’t even give me a ballpark unless I come in and pay for a consultation, but I cannot possibly fly all over the world going to consultations just to get quotes. My resources are very limited. 

Any specific info on these non surgical procedures, their various names, and where to look to get them would be very helpful, in addition to my other questions (urgency and possibility to get other types of procedures, what are my best options). I am willing to travel to get what I need, and I don’t want my uterus removed. I am alone, I have no one, and I am really overwhelmed. Thank you so much for the help.

694,AskDocs,"I don’t know where else to ask this. I’ve been to three doctors (two initial visits to the CareNow and one to a an actual Urologist) and they have no clue what to do, so they just do the bare minimum and prescribe antibiotics. 

A month and a half ago, I began experiencing the constant urge to pee. You know when you’ve been riding in a car, and you have to pee really bad but you have to hold it until you get to the next stop, and the “holding it in” makes your lower abdomen-ish area feel likes it’s being stretched. It’s almost a “burn” sensation. 

That’s what I was feeling all the time. Of course, as a stubborn man I just ignored it and went on about my business. My fiancée has had numerous UTI’s, and I thought a UTI in men would go away just like with women. 

After about a week of the constant urge to pee and constant bathroom trips only to barely get out a trickle, I got irritated and got a self UTI pee-test thing. It tested positive for leukocytes or whatever (white blood cells). So, I went to CareNow. The doctor had me pee in a cup. They tested the urine immediately with a similar dip test, and the doctor told me that I had a bladder infection because the dip came back positive. They sent off the urine for a urine culture test or whatever. 

I was given antibiotic for ten days. By day four, my symptoms were about gone, and on day five I was 100% better. I got a call about the urine culture test: it came back negative. Weird cause the antibiotic was helping. I continued the antibiotic all the way through, and on the last day of medication (I hadn’t even taken the last pill yet), the symptoms came back. 

So, I went in to another CareNow (getting a visit with a specialist takes like a week or more) and the new doctor, for whatever reason, was SURE I had an sti or std. She had me pee in another cup and sent me on my way with a different antibiotic that would treat UTI as well as std’s. 

Well, this antibiotic did not help AT ALL. My symptoms got worse. I was now having trouble peeing at all. It would stop and go during urination. I had to really buckle down to urinate or else I would pee in little spurts. My pee also smelled strongly. No blood in urine though. I also was having bad pain in my back and sides, where my kidneys are, and I was having pain in my abdomen that was radiating into my groin. 

CareNow called again and told me I DID NOT have an sti or std, which I already knew and told the doc but whatever. I know they just want to be sure. 

At this point I’m feeling like crap, can’t even go to class without having to get up every ten minutes and go pee, only to get back to class and have to leave again to do it all over again. So, I go to a urologist. He thinks I might have kidney stones. Gives me 6 weeks of bactrim (antibiotic) for any bacteria and flomax for “opening up my ureters”. 

I was told to start the bactrim first for two days and then start the flomax. So I did just that. Two days of bactrim didn’t do a thing. Like an hour after I started the flomax though, my sides started hurting less and less, and I was able to pee better. Otherwise, the symptoms persisted for a few days, but were getting less and less annoying. Got a call about the PSA test and urine test. PSA came back normal and urine test was again negative. 

Finally, after about a week of treatment, my symptoms were GONE completely. I never peed out any stones that I was aware of, but I could have missed some small ones or something. I had a CT scan done right after my symptoms were finally improving and it was negative for stones. 

Cut to a week later. Symptoms are starting to come back again. No pain in back or sides, but constant urge to pee and bladder pressure is back. I go in for my follow up appointment, and the urologist tells me to keep taking flomax for the rest of my life and that I’m stressed out and that’s what might be causing it. He tells me to take up meditation and sends me on my way. 

A week later, I’m still taking bactrim and flomax, praying that the bactrim will solve the problem. Symptoms finally start going away again. This was a week and a half ago that the symptoms started going away. For the last week, I’ve been taking only bactrim, and my symptoms have been nonexistent, until yesterday. 

Urge to pee is back in full force.

697,AskDocs,"hi guys, so i'll try to add all the input i can think of but feel free to ask anything extra.

i'm 24, male, 6'0"" &amp; 140 pounds. i eat healthy, exercise regularly and i have never been on medication. i am sober sober and have been for a while, no coffee even cos i seem to be hypersensitive to any stimulants lol.

so i've had this sensation that is quite distressing which comes and goes, sometimes happening multiple times in a day and other times i can go weeks without it arising. the best way i can explain it is that it is strikingly similar to that sensation one gets when they're usually laying down at night about to fall asleep and they get that sudden gasp for air that feels like a massive fight or flight signal being sent throughout the body. it's always very short lived, lasting for a segment of a second, but this feeling has been happening to me at all times of the day on days where it's frequent, and it can get pretty distracting when i have these like ""episodes"" where it happens 5-6 times within a few minutes. i can not really tell where the sensation comes from directly as it feels like my whole body is reacting to it at once, so my best guess would be it is some silly brain thing going on. could be way off though with that guess.
an important sidenote to mention is i am recovering from some not so light substance abuse lol, but i've been sober for over a year now and this sensation has dramatically worsened over this last month. i've had this going for well over a year honestly, just never as much as i have lately.
i've tried to get advice on this locally but it's always been brushed off towards the assumption that it's anxiety. i believe anxiety may play a part on its frequent reoccurence in a set period of time because of how much of a fight/flight response i have to this thing but i am truly dumbfounded.

kind of want to figure it out as it is pretty worrying, every time it happens it truly feels like if it just lasted for an extra few seconds i would be in a state of emergency. so yeah.. if anyone has heard of anything even remotely similar any words of advice would be appreciated. thanks",t2_8anmdzdh,0,"[24 M] very odd sensation i've been seeking to understand for over a year now with clinical visits, still nothing.",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12oqjqb,True,eraofdeath,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12oqjqb/24_m_very_odd_sensation_ive_been_seeking_to/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12oqjqb/24_m_very_odd_sensation_ive_been_seeking_to/,475306,1681682223,0,,False,1681682234,1681682235,2023-04-16 21:57:03,,,

700,AskDocs,"My mum [51F] had a total thyroidectomy on Thursday and came home yesterday afternoon. She initially had a drain in each side to prevent a hematoma, but these were removed before she left the hospital. 

The surgery all went successfully, she's happy with her aftercare and medications, (which includes calcium tablets as the consultant wants to be sure her levels don't drop) but it wasn't until we got home and were able to remove the gauze to clean her up a bit that we spotted these beads on either side of her neck and now we have some questions. https://imgur.com/a/4ZDJLyU 

I'm assuming they're something to do with her stitches, but any googling we've done just gives us craft beads and embroidery which isn't exactly helpful. 

So are they attached to stitches? How concerned about catching them on clothing should we be? She has re-covered them carefully for now, but we are finding it difficult to avoid getting tape near her incision. 

We're also unsure where the entry points of her drains were, in one picture for the left side of her neck there's a lump of dried blood that we think could be where the drain was inserted away from the main incision, (circled in green) but on the right side there doesn't seem to be a matching sized hole. We did find a tiny red dot (circled in green with a ?) which is the only thing we could see that might be an entry point, but the drain was much thicker than this - could it have healed and closed that much without a scab within 48 hours? She was told to avoid getting anything wet or scrubbing anything for a week so we didn't want to risk cleaning up the other side to compare if that was the same. 

There's also thread coming out of the beads but one side is very short and the other is quite long (marked blue). I'm concerned about it catching on clothing or something and pulling, is this something that could cause an issue? If so, could we trim it to be short like the other side or does it need to be this long and has been left like this on purpose? I've no idea how stitches like this work so we don't want to do anything and make it more difficult when it comes to removing them.

Back in December 2022, I had various lumps on the right side of my neck, which I'm assuming were swollen lymph nodes. I didn't have any symptoms of infection/illness. Some came and went but the longest stayed there for over 2 weeks. They were soft (I think - it's hard to distinguish) and didn't get bigger in size. I was debating about getting it checked but it was around the festive period and they all did eventually go away. 

Now, I have another lump on the right side of my neck, again I'm assuming it's the same thing. Again, not unwell. It's been about two weeks now and I think it is going down but it is still there. 

The only other thing I have now noticed just today are these tiny red dots. I have about 8 of them on my trunk/flank all spread out. They are pin-sized and do not hurt or itch. Never noticed them before. They are not clustered - just 8 individual red dots.

703,AskDocs,"Hello! 

I (30F) have been having some pretty terrifying heart stuff going on for about the last two months. Bullet point info!


About me:
- 30F, 5’11” 230lbs. Low impact except use 2-3 times a week (30-60 minute dog walks). 

- vyvanse 60mg for BED, simvastatin for cholesterol, HCTZ for water retention (started retaining water a few years ago, never figured out why. Blood pressure has always been excellent), lexapro 10mg, Vitamin D w/ calcium 5000mg daily. Alprazolam as needed (rare), valtrax for cold sores (rare). Been on all of these 3+ years. 

- Rarely drinks, vapes on occasion. No recreational drug use. 

- High cholesterol but it’s in normal limits since I’ve been on a statin. Obese my whole life (was 300lbs about a decade ago. Lost 100 gained 30 and have coasted at that for the last six years. No other chronic physical health conditions. Mental health wise: CPTSD, GAD, and depression, but it’s managed enough that I have a pretty good QOL. No major changes other than getting married in October but it didn’t feel like the crazy life change people make it out to be. 

- mom has MS, type two diabetes. Father died of congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest.

Nitty gritty:
- on my honey moon in Mexico I experienced my first “episode”. February 12th. Sudden dizziness, tachycardia up to ~170, feelings of doom, feelings of ice water being poured over my head. Can’t breathe, somewhat disoriented. No real chest pain. Tingling in fingers and toes. Comes in waves. Finally goes away after about an hour. This came on top of some serious food poisoning that lasted about a week (not a great way to spend my honeymoon!) 


- experience “attacks” twice more in the beginning of March, but much more mild, not lasting more than 10 or 15 minutes. All of these events happen about 30-40 minutes after eating something. 


- last night, I ate dinner around 5:30pm. Sitting on the couch at 6:00 pm knitting and watching Star Trek, suddenly my heart rate spikes. All the same symptoms of the first time, but worse. Call my sister to try and distract myself. Put my feet in ice water. Do vague nerve breathing. It didn’t work. Check heart rate, fluctuating between 135 and 170. Spiked up to 200. Decide to call an aid car. Guys come out, check my vitals. Confirm my heart rate is crazy high, but other vitals are okay. O2 is 100%. Super nice guys, ask if I want to go to the ER. I assume I’m having a panic attack so I declined and took my alprazolam. After about thirty minutes the ice water feeling goes away, but my heart is still in the 130-140 range and I still feel lightheaded, dizzy, and tingling all the way until I pass out at 10 pm.


I have never had a history of panic attacks before, at least nothing on this scale. I still feel exhausted from yesterday and my heart rate keeps spiking but only for a few minutes at a time.

704,AskDocs,"3YO girl, 39 pounds, 39 inches. FPIES, a couple of food allergies, eczema pops up occasionally, 2 UTIs since January. 

My poor little girl has been struggling with what she calls ""heebie jeebies"" in her feet when lying down since sometime in January. It started in one foot but is now both feet and has changed from just at night to even happening in her carseat (she sits rear facing and semi-reclined). She has described the sensation as ""tickles,"" ""pins and needles,"" ""crawling,"" and ""heebie  jeebies."" She shows us that it is primarily the middle of her feet to her toes, on the underside. 

She wakes 3-4 times a night, very upset, and not much can be done. Putting pressure on her feet can sometimes help but it is really disrupting her ability to get a quality night's sleep. I am confident it isn't behavioral because I see before she's even awake, as she enters into a lighter sleep she starts kicking her legs frantically until she wakes up. 

We have seen her (amazing) pediatrician for this a few times. We have tried: magnesium lotion, magnesium supplements, increase in iron, massages, Epsom salt baths, stretches... nothing has helped, it has gotten worse over the past few months. 

We saw a podiatrist who said her feet look totally normal and suggested neuro. 

Neuro at our local children's hospital estimates a 9 month wait. Don't get me wrong, I am so glad we aren't needing urgent care here, but how do I deal with a 3 year old who cannot sleep for 9 more months? That's awful. 

Other things to note:
- her feet do not look different when she has these episodes: capillary refill is good, no redness or paleness, no rashes..Her feet do not feel hot or cold.
- I inadvertently discovered by rubbing her lower back one night that this seems to make her very uncomfortable and she told me it made her feet worse. I don't know if that can even be true but I've avoided her back since 
- She has a tendency to curl her toes really tight when sitting around, no clue if that's making it worse

705,AskDocs,"37M, 5’5, 130lb, currently taking valtrex daily for the last month. No other medical conditions.  No direct family members with diabetes. Non smoker.

Thanks for reading this. I’m trying to understand the likelihood of having prediabetes given some lifestyle changes, symptoms and the results of a blood sugar fasting test. 

Background: I  took a new job in January that led to a dramatic cut in my exercise, diet quality, sleep quality, and an increase in stress/anxiety.  

I thought the fatigue and exhaustion I’ve been feeling was just job related but Over the last week or two I’ve started having a lot of random itching around my ankles and lower legs, as well as my forearms and hands. 

Because I knew I’ve been eating a lot of sugars, bad food, and putting on &lt;10lbs due to not excising anymore I decided to do a fasting blood test this morning.  The glucose meter came in at 107.  In Feb I had an annual physical and, while they weren’t doing an A1c specifically, I saw that those levels came in &lt;90 (also taken first thing in the morning). 

I’ve been reading and prediabetes is described as anywhere from 100-125 on a fasting glucose test.  But I read elsewhere that on an A1C test, after conversion, that range would actually start at 117.

I’m planning to visit my doctor but that might not be for a couple days.

So I’m hoping someone can give me some clarity in the meantime about how serious my 107 result is and what range I should be using as my guide.

My results in Feb were so much lower I’m confused about how this mornings could be so dramatically different.

707,AskDocs,"Hello Doctors of Reddit. I am a 38 year old man from Boston that has suffered many concussions, mostly in my youth. 

My question relates to a specific childhood concussion. I was sledding at age 10, launched off a huge jump and knocked myself out cold. To make matters worse, my father thought I was just dragging my heels to leave, so he walked home and left me there. I was actually unconscious on the ground for some time. My Mom came and found me a while later. I don’t know how long, maybe 15 minutes- the hill was very close to my house. 

It might’ve been my first complete lack of consciousness. There were many more knockouts after that age, as I was a fearless adrenaline junkie, I boxed, wrestled and was pretty good at being aggressively dangerous to myself. This concussion was the only time I ever hallucinated afterwards. 

When I awoke from that particular concussion, I recall walking along the brook that led to my house with my Mom. I was hallucinating intensely- I saw a whole family of ducks on the brook that no one else could see…

My question is, how damaging are severe concisions at an early age? I later was diagnosed as Bi Polar 1, and am doing very well with my current meds. I wonder if this concussion, and the nearly (10) others in my youth could’ve caused me to develop Bi Polar Disorder.",t2_276oxnhw,0,Hallucinations after concussion?,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12opuad,True,mantis_tobagan_md,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12opuad/hallucinations_after_concussion/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12opuad/hallucinations_after_concussion/,475305,1681680840,0,,False,1681680852,1681680853,2023-04-16 21:34:00,,,

My girlfriend (trans female, 49 years old)  has a skin anomaly on one single spot of her scalp. She doesn't smoke. She drinks occasionally. 
 The anomaly is an area of about 1x1cm. 

It's itchy. 
She instinctively tried pulling bits out and scratching it,  resulting on light inflammation and bleeding. It was then when she showed it to me and then it just looked like a wound resulting from scratching.

Up close it looks like the epidermis has grown in some unusual way.
Now, after she's let it be for about a week it looks like tiny scales looking like teeth attached on one end.

It doesn't seem to affect hair growth. The colour is the same as dry skin.

Postpartum Hernia? Help!

I am 4 months postpartum with my second. 

At about 6 months postpartum with my first I developed what felt like a hernia, pain while coughing or sneezing but no lump. By the time my dr appointment for it came around the pain had subsided and I was given papers on diastasis recti. 

Now the pain has come back, same spot as before, to the right of my belly button but worse this time. It does not seem like an umbilical hernia but seems like one in my abs. The pain is what worries me and google says small hernias are more risky. 


I already spoke with my dr at my postpartum appointment about the possibility of it coming back and she just gave me the “sometimes you need surgery sometimes you don’t”


It went away the first time around so I’m really hoping it goes away this time. Having something wrong with my body is giving me anxiety. Can anyone offer any wisdom or experience?

My brief med profile:
28yo male. 5' 7"". 133 lbs (was 145 lbs before lumbar puncture on the 6th, but have lost weight rapidly due to not wanting to move much because of pain so I haven't been getting up to eat as much as I should). Currently on Robaxin generic for muscle relaxing to alleviate some of the back pain (it's helping). Never smoke. No prior medical history at all.

Backstory:
Had a lumbar puncture done April 6th (no medical conditions myself, did it for a research study). April 9th had a blood patch. April 11th had a 2nd blood patch due to 2nd dislodging. 2nd blood patch seems to have worked well since I no longer have hell migraines while upright. Lower back pain and lower part of front right rib bone hurts a fair bit though to say the least (enough that it makes me move around way slower than I'd like). Is it possible lower back pain is just gonna last a week or two since I've essentially had 6 needles in lumbar area in a 5 day period if you include numbing needle? Also, I've been tossing and turning in bed a lot due to only being able to tolerate one position for 30 minutes or so before it becomes too uncomfortable either for ribs, or lower back depending on if I'm laying on side or on my back. Any advice would be appreciated greatly. Just sat in computer chair for about 4 hours to get out of bed and that's when I noticed the rib pain was significantly worse.

731,AskDocs,"49F, 5’1” 97lbs. History of Pulsatile tinnitus in left ear, Increasingly anxious/restless with a hard time relaxing/sleeping. Feel very on edge like I have too much adrenaline. I’m wondering if there could be a physical cause. I am very easily startled and easily get upset when having a disagreement with my spouse to the point that I feel like I might die from a heart attack. 

History that may or may not be relevant: 

A couple years ago I had a CT scan to follow up on some lung nodules, which noted ‘left adrenal thickening’ (incidental finding). My  most recent CT scan showed normal adrenals. 

In the last couple years, whenever I get my BP checked, the numbers are very spread apart (ie: 128/59). In previous years I have always has perfect blood pressure readings (90/70). 

I also frequently feel a very strong pulse in the back of my neck that keeps me from falling asleep most nights. It’s a thumping that moves the pillowcase - not just a sensation of being forceful. 

According to my Fitbit, my heart is almost never going below my resting heart rate when I sleep. 

No health issues except recent digestive issues (bloating/distention/abdominal pain). Have a v-sign rash on check that was biopsied for amyopathic dermatomyositis but was negative. The pathologist said it was rosacea, which I’m doubtful of. 

What tests should I ask for or are my problems just simply anxiety-related?

Labia minora is red with vertical white streaks where it touches. No vaginal discharge. Not even my pre-pregnancy amounts. Smell is normal, but sometimes stronger after wearing underwear for a bit. I wouldn’t call it yeasty, but also not fish like. But it isn’t a pleasant/my normal smell. Was tested for STDs in my pregnancy which is routine, and was all negative. Partner and I are monogamous. No itchiness. No painful urination. If there’s burning, maybe very VERY minimal, but I don’t notice it if I’m just going. My pain tolerance is pretty high. Did an at home pH test and it was at a 5.

I have always had issues with my ears, especially itch and sometimes moisture. I was told that it was eczema. 2 years ago, I became completely unable to hear for a while due to clogging. It happened a month ago again, I got my ears cleaned and they said that it might be due to teenage hormones.
One week ago my ear got clogged again. I experience headaches, tongue and throat pain. 

Also for as long as I can remember I always get intense headaches at the back of my ears, to the point that it makes me cry.

My mother and her mother also have eczema inside their ears.

Demographic:
Male
36
5’3”
130lbs
Non-smoker (cigarettes)
Almost a non-drinker
Only takes vitamins (Vit C - 1000mg, Vit B complex, fish oil gel capsules, calcium)

Started: October 2022

Sexually active? NO - only had sex with my wife when I was with her from June - September (we’re in a LDR, thousands of miles apart) and probably won’t have another intercourse until I see her again (not sure when, yet)

Pain or itch? NO

Background: They initially appeared as white bumps around the foreskin. The morning after masturbating the night before. There are days when it’s white, other days they are skin colored. The bumps on the glans appeared a few weeks after.

For some background: 
I am 23F, 130 lbs, 5’6 in height. I am taking Norco painkillers, as well as OTC stool softeners. I do not smoke. I got a hemorrhoid removed on the 10th. So about a week ago. Process has been going as smooth as it can with this recovery.
Although, this morning when I went to the restroom, there was something in my stool that concerned me.
It was light brown and about 3 inches in length. I do have a picture but it's a kinda gruesome so l'm choosing not to post it. I ate some salad on Friday and some of the leaves did seem stringy, but l'm not sure if they would make it out the other side undigested.

I’ve had this patch of bumps on and off for the last month or so. Normally they only appear for a day or two then go away, but I’ve had this patch for a week now. There are also some on my other hand now, but not as many and they’re spread apart. 

These bumps aren’t red, and do not itch unless I accidentally touch them. I have no known allergies and I don’t take any medication. I have a copper IUD, but that’s it. No poisonous/irritating plants around (that I know of). 

I’m not super worried about these as they’re only mild annoying at best, but just curious as to what it could be. I don’t have health insurance so I’m posting here instead.

I thought nothing of it, that perhaps it's just allergies since the allergy index where I live is pretty high. However, when I woke up Friday morning, my tonsils were sore. They weren't very sore, (For context as a kid I got tonsillitis once a year but my pediatrician refused to remove my tonsils. That being said, back then the soreness was REALLY bad. However at that moment on Friday they weren't that bad. Maybe a bit on the itchy side. Kinda dry.) So once more, I thought maybe allergies. However, Saturday I felt fine again but super tired and started having post nasal drip cough that doesn't stop. Then by Saturday night, I had a low grade fever of 99.5F. I took some benadryl and an alieve to help me sleep and lower the fever. It did neither. 

However, I woke up today Sunday (April 16th 2023) and the fever was gone but my cough is worse. By noon, my fever was back to 99.6 and hasn't gone down since. I am typing this at 4:00 pm and it rose to 100.7F. I decided to take some alieve and I am waiting for the fever to go down. 

I've been in bed all day coughing up a lung, drinking water and ginger ale. 

The reason why I am writing this now is because 1.) Healthcare in America is blah and my insurance is bad and I don't really have the cash rn to go to the Dr's let alone get cough medicine. (This year's been tight). 

The other reason why I am writing this now is because I want to see if anyone knows what I have and what I can do.

At this time, my only symptoms are: Post nasal cough, sore throat from coughing so much, and fever. 

However, I have no other symptoms. There's no thick mucus, everything is clear white, no stuffy nose, no blocked sinuses, no sinus pressure, no headaches, no runny nose, no tight chest or chest pain, My ears feel fine, no loss of appetite, I can smell and taste still, no nausea, no diarrhea, my chest doesn't feel congested. 

So honestly, I have no idea. Usually when I so get sick, it's EVERYTHING I listed above and I have a really bad time.

770,AskDocs,"Hi there. I’m a 36yr old female, 130Ibs, non-smoker (occasional marijuana use), and on 20mg of lexapro for about 3 months treat anxiety. 

Three nights ago while sleeping, I experienced severe pain that came in waves in my left temple area and lasted only a few mins (maybe less). I stayed half asleep during it but remember feeling like each wave of pain was so excruciating I was going to die. I fell back into deep sleep after and woke up wondering what the hell that was. I’ve had a mild headache that seems to come in waves in that same spot (left temple) since the incident. At times it’s not noticeable, but sometimes it feels like a mild migraine with a bit of nausea. I don’t typically get migraines but do have a family history of them (my sister gets migraines, and grandma did while she was alive). I did get the occasional pregnancy migraine, but that seemed to go away after I gave birth 1.5yrs ago.

I’m basically just curious if this sounds concerning, not sure if I should just brush this off as some migraine or weird headache episode.  My grandma died of a brain aneurysm which I believe makes me genetically prone to them? 

Some more info: I usually take the 20mg of lexapro at night prior to going to bed between 10-11pm.  I didn’t take it that night prior to going to sleep BUT I will miss a dose somewhat frequently, maybe once a week, with no I’ll effects in past.

* Got allergy tested. Allergic to dog and dust; have never had problems with either before. No other allergies symptoms; never had a single case of sneezing, itching, etc. Tested and no food intolerances, etc. 
* Went through 5 months of utter misery trying to live with dog. Unable to walk around block due to extreme head pressure. Ears so inflamed that opening jaw triggered clicks audible across the room. CT scan shows moderate but widespread inflammation. ENT is shocked by the severity based on my scan.
* Things I tried during this period to reduce symptoms: flonase, antibiotics (Z-pack and amoxicillin courses), perfect humidity control, etc. Trust me, everything you may suggest, I tried.
* Completely normal bloodwork (tested 3 times, 2 months apart). Bloodwork involved ""weird things"" too. Consult 5 specialists across medicine who cannot think of anything else to test. Positive ANA but barely significant (1:40). Lupus, Sjogren's, Lyme disease, etc. ruled out. Neurologist confirms perfect neurological health; migraines/pressure headaches ruled out. No TMJ, etc. No GERD or LPR.
* Give up, re-home dog, cry, move to new apartment. 
* New apartment is cleaned daily with organic cleaners, hardwood floors. New building, no pets allowed. No dog exposure. No furniture or blinds, just a mattress w/ dust cover. Taking no chances. It is the perfect environment from an ""allergen control"" perspective.
* See renowned ENT with private practice. Dozens of peer reviewed articles, Ivy med school, etc. 
* ENT prescribes a course of prednisone to calm inflammation. Encourages me to continue with Flonase and increases dosing. Encourages me to take ibuprofen as needed for inflammation.
* I've lived in new apartment for two months. Followed above routine perfectly. Mild improvement but still severe symptoms. Still miserable. Easily fatigued. Can walk a little bit every day, but can't exercise.
* Fast forward to current week.
* Go back to ENT today. She sees **nothing wrong** during endoscopy; everything she sees looks perfectly healthy! Previously, saw some inflammation and pre-polypoid tissue. ENT is shocked I'm still experiencing symptoms with such a healthy exam.
* Posits two possibilities:
   * **Theory #1**: Inflammation was so extreme from dog allergies + such a long period that it is still slowly coming down, which is causing pressure.
      * Counterpoint #1: Multiple allergists (3) told me it would be hugely atypical for allergy-induced inflammation to continue after so much time away + w/ such a thorough treatment routine and controlled environment.
      * Counterpoint #1: I feel **completely normal** at times for multiple hours. My symptom severity varies drastically within single days and hours. It is unusual that inflammation could come and go within an hour. These fluctuations have been confirmed through diagnostic use of Afrin (which I only used 3 times in 3 months, weeks apart, to confirm these fluctuations are occurring. Please do not suggest rhinitis medicamentosa—thanks!)
   * **Theory #2** Bacterial biofilms have become widespread throughout my sinuses for whatever reason. These bacteria emit gas cause a sensation of pressure.
      * Counterpoint #1: Never had a bacterial infection throughout this ordeal, at least one that resulted in any symptoms (fever, green mucus, etc.)
      * Counterpoint #2: Obviously biofilms impede antibiotics, but still have gone through two courses... 
* Where I am at now:
   * Desperate for help. There's barely any knowledge about the true causes of atypical chronic sinusitis. 
   * Desperate to avoid surgery. I know this problem has a distinct cause. Something *changed*. It was like a switch flipped. Please do not suggest surgery as a solution. I am aware that it is an avenue. I do not want to hear it advised now. 
   * Desperate for sound advice. Look, people advocate things like putting baby shampoo in sinus rinses, using Xylitol sprays, using colloidal silver, etc. Then there are an equal number of comments are from doctors saying method X is quackery. 
      * Beyond what I'm doing/have done w/ antibiotics, irrigation and Flonase, **I feel like I don't know how to fight biofilms, because doctors don't know.** 
   * Desperate generally.
      * I will do anything and whatever it takes. I will spend my life savings. I will move to Colorado.

Hi, 

I have this very odd problem that I could not for the life of me find anything out about. Basically, today is the fourth occurrence of this in the last about 6 months. 3 of the 4 times being 3 days in a row. 

In the morning I wake up and try to continue to sleep, I usually sleep on my back but can't stay like that for long and so I'm often switching from side to side as well and it always feels very comfortable. however, when this thing happens, when I lay on my side (either side), my left pec muscle has a sharp sudden pain like its just been torn, extremely concentrated in the middle of the chest (inner pec muscle). This does not happen if I remain laying on my back. The first time this ever happened was when I pushed myself out of bed using my left arm and I felt a sudden pain in my left pec. When this happens, if I bend over I feel a great deal of pain almost like my pec is ""hanging"". 

I workout 4x at the gym a week. When this strain happens it is too painful to do anything with my chest. However, I have been able to prevent this strain as I ""feel it coming on"" in the morning by not laying on my side. Even when I do get the strain, the next day its a b it sore but I'm pretty much able to bench press heavy weights no problem. It also never happens once I'm out of bed. I can go from the bed get up for a few minutes, go straight to the couch and lay on my side and it feels fine. I can even flex my chest as hard as I can and nothing happens. I can workout with heavy weights do a ton of sets on my chest and feels great. But it is specifically ONLY while I am in bed in the morning that this occurs. Nothing in my life has changed in the last few months so I have no idea what the hell is causing this.",t2_brgqf,0,Random Left Pec Strains that last a few days but only when lying on my side and only in the morning.,[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,This user has not yet been verified.,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12olrhg,True,WockItOut,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12olrhg/random_left_pec_strains_that_last_a_few_days_but/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12olrhg/random_left_pec_strains_that_last_a_few_days_but/,475258,1681673113,0,,False,1681673126,1681673127,2023-04-16 19:25:13,,,

the pain is basically making me think i should call 111. my chest and ribs just ache and stab. or i can wait a week till i am back at uni and see my gp. because i just think if i call 111 and say i have chest pain amd cant breathe theyll send me to a&amp;e. but i dont think my breathing is bad enough at all for a&amp;e. 
i cant register as a temporary gp here as theyre really diffiuckt about it here ive tried before so . and i cant ask for inhalers from my gp ay uni they wont send them to a pharmacy here and they have to give me an appointment to approve them.

For the last few days I’ve had a general sense of panic like something is wrong with me. I tried to ignore it but it wont go away. I’m 15 weeks pregnant and have been a bit nauseous every day so I didn’t think much of my nausea symptoms. I’ve also lost all my appetite and have lost a few pounds over the past 3 days and today a bright yellow diarrhoea has started. I can only describe it as Simpson yellow. 

Of course I’m a idiot and went of google and convinced myself I have liver failure.

I was very worried so I went to the midwives this morning and they took my urine and blood. In my urine the found leukocytes, protein and ketones. They told me it was probably because I hadn’t eaten and the protein was just a bit above average and they weren’t worried but took my blood to make sure. 

They called with the blood results and everything came back perfect/normal. I asked a few times if my liver and kidneys were ok and she said yes. 

My question is could there still be a problem with my liver that didn’t show in the blood work? Could there be another reason for symptoms? The midwife said they are not worried and it’s all pregnancy related.

800,AskDocs,"Over the last three years I’ve been to 18 different Doctors about my symptoms and have always been dismissed until in February after a visit to emergency with what I thought was an allergic reactions. 

I had a low temperature, felt like i was fainting over and over, was disorientated, confused. My limps went really heavy and my hands and feet started tingling and then went numb. My jaw felt paralyzed and i couldnt speak. My blood pressure was low (80/58) and the doctors kept saying it was really optimal. I had a wave of feeling like I was going to throw up and shit myself. When it passed it just couldn’t rest. I couldn’t put my head back- I just kept bobbing a bit back and forth and then I started having hallucinations - just black shapes in my vision - patches of darkness that would move if I moved my eyes. Sometimes Shapes of animals but just usually blobs - I thought I might die I just felt horrendous. The doctors did nothing. They thought I was having anxiety and since I explained I had something I was allergic to they just checked my airways when I first came in and then left me for a couple hours. 

Within about 3 hours I started being able to speak again and regained feeling on my hands and feet. I went to a follow up with my doctor and they did lots of labs and just found a slightly elevated hemocrit and mcv. I asked for my cortisol to be tested. Am cortisol came back at 42 and then 43 - so the doctors said it was slightly low but gave me nothing 

Over the next month I was back at the hospital and emergency multiple times for episodes of the same thing. They started checking my cortisol (not in the hospital when I was presenting with symptoms but the next morning) - it was mostly low but sometimes normal (highest 8am was 330, other results were 63, and 120). 

I also had an mri as they suggested pituitary Adenoma but it came back clear (no contrast) 

I saw a naturopath and requested medication and he gave me 5mg of prednisone per day. I ended up taking a bit more but it helped a lot. 

I then saw an internist who suggested Addison’s. No acth stim test has been scheduled. 

Next I saw an endocrinologist who tested all hormones off medication for 24 hours 

My acth was at 7.5 a few months ago, but is now at 1. Dheas was 2.6. Am cortisol was 180. 

Endocrinology says it’s likely secondary adrenal insufficiency but no known cause. 

In the last 2 years I have gained 60 pounds. I do not eat excessively and I exercise. Lately I have started putting in massive efforts to increase exercise and decrease calories. I eat between 1000 and 1200 calories a day. I weigh my food and calculate everything. I don’t miss my milk in my coffee or any small items. I exercise to burn a minimum of 600 calories per day. I either hike or walk 8km a day or I bike 20. I haven’t missed a day in 4 weeks. I somehow lost ten pounds in the first week and a half and then it’s come back and more since. If I eat any carbs I get extremely bloated and have noticeable fatigue. 

My kidney function tests show gfr of 125. My b12 without supplements was high - 631. I have not taken supplements since November.

When I was 17, I felt a 2cm mass in my right breast while i was showering. Got a biopsy, it was a fibroadenoma. 

A couple of months ago, felt pain around my nipple area, felt another one. Got it checked out again via ultrasound, it is 1cm with benign features, doc said likely another fibroadenoma. Opted out of another biopsy and just chose a follow up ultrasound in 6 months. 

A week ago, i felt a THIRD one. Pretty small, but same old story. Felt some pain under my nipple, felt another lump. Id estimate this is about a centimeter as well. I’m planning to mention it at my follow up, probably just to get it scanned as well. 

Since I already have a follow up scheduled in the summer, I decided to wait for that instead of making a new appointment. So i’m asking a question here in the meantime. 

My question is, is this concerning? Why do I keep growing them? Is it common for multiple to grow? I know i shouldn’t dwell on the future, but i’ve read studies linking fibroadenomas to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Is this true? How do I prevent that?

__________________________

I developed a sudden and profound metallic taste about a year ago.  It was extremely bothersome, I had to chew gum all day long and grab a new piece every 15 minutes.  Couldn't fall asleep without a breath mint to mask the awful taste.  There was a period of time (last June, I think) when I had reduced sensitivity to salty/acidic tastes.

After trying a number of different things (omeprazole, nystatin for a minor candida infection, B12), I finally realized that I was clenching my jaw at night (likely from anxiety) and had profound crenating/scalloping on my tongue.  After I started wearing a night guard (Rx from dentist), the metallic taste was greatly reduced after a couple weeks and slowly started improving after that.

It's been about 10 months since I started wearing a night guard.  The crenating and the metallic taste is significantly reduced.

[Tongue from a year ago before wearing the night guard](https://imgur.com/a/Efnk2o3)

[Tongue today after 10 months of wearing night guard](https://imgur.com/a/OhwTWhd)

But the taste is not gone completely.  It's still bothersome enough that I feel the need to chew gum all day, but I can chew the same piece for hours until my next meal and I'm able to get to sleep now without needing something to mask the taste.

I only taste it along the edge of my tongue towards the back.  In some ways, I might also describe it as a mild burning sensation.  It's definitely worse about 5 minutes after I've brushed my teeth, no matter what toothpaste or mouthwash I use.

813,AskDocs,"I (22F) have been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD and GAD a while ago. In august, I started experimenting awful panic attacks when going to sleep after a sleepless night. I started getting progressively worse intrusive thoughts about what would happen should I not be able to fall asleep. They quickly started to become really disruptive and I got prescribed Atarax to manage them. After a while, I noticed the medication was not helping at all and stopped taking it. This was about two months ago. To substitute that, I got prescribed Quetiapine (Seroquel) and Trittico(Trazodone). My psychiatrist told me I could just try them both on separate nights and see which would work best (I was supposed to take them as needed, so not necessarily every day). I took seroquel (25mgs) for a couple of days (about a week) and then, after talking to another doctor, I started taking Trazodone and took it every day for about a week and a half. Then I decided to take quetiapine for one night, nothing for the three nights after and then quetiapine again. The day after I started feeling really bad but I just thought it was the side effects of the seroquel, which were always pretty strong. It was in the evening that I realized that I maybe should have not switched my medications just like that and started taking trittico again.

Hi all, some context: I’ve had a swollen salivary gland on the right side of my throat on and off for months now. I’ve been to a few specialists who wrote it off as dehydration/salivary stones, so I decided to finally get an ultrasound for peace of mind. These are the results:

FINDINGS: The right submandibular gland is normal in appearance. No stones are identified. The ducts do not appear dilated. There is a 5 mm well-circumscribed hypoechoic structure adjacent to the gland that could be a small cyst. No Doppler flow is identified. A small hypovascular nodule is also possible. Could consider follow-up ultrasound. Small lymph nodes are identified. There are no pathologically enlarged nodes.

The spirometry results. Do they show both Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (because it is reversible but only at some level, and the MEF 25-75 is just so low?)

Will be having CT Scan soon. One doctor says it's Small Airway Disease and the the medication should be stopped ( **Medrol pill for a week, now Flixotide 100 and Symbicort (4 doses/24 hrs)** , because it's not really helping in this case anymore, since the cough has stopped. Another says it's Asthma so Flixotide and especially Symbicort should be used for months, to prevent other cases of flare ups.

We are lost. We don't know what to do. My daughter is even more lost, she's jut a child, and she doesn't know if it's ok to take her scholarship and go study in the US, or if this is risking ruining her lungs even more. Is this a death sentence, since the spirometry values are so low, we don't know why (is it previous infections, as she had many colds since she was an infant, which were always followed by strong cough, for which she would take steroids, inhalers and antibiotics? Is it genetic (we had that A1 gene test, it's not that. If she stops taking Asthma medication (one doctor says it's not worth the risk) will it cause even more Small Airway Disease problem because of constant inflammation, or does Asthma only cause inflammation during a flare up (my daughter hadn't had a flare up in the last couple of years, except last month)?

No medications 

So for the past roughly 3 weeks I’ve been experiencing dizziness. I’ve been to the doctors a bunch of times and I’m currently off work because it’s so disorienting. So far the doctors have confirmed it isn’t vertigo as the dizziness doesn’t seem to be affected by movements that I make. The dizziness I feel kind of feels like when you stand up too quickly and get a head rush but it will just happen all of the time for no reason. I do also have good days where I don’t seem to experience the dizziness much at all but that will be maybe one day out of a week. I often feel the dizziness when I lie down to go to sleep at night as well, and when I rest the back of my head against something. Over the last 4 or 5 days I’ve been getting very light headaches which do fade with painkillers. I wanted to mention that but do bare in mind my screen time has been up a bit since being off work so I think that could explain the headaches. 

I’ve also been having some issues with my ears where they keep feeling blocked like when your on an airplane and they pop, they feel full and like they won’t pop again. My doctors are thinking I have an inner ear infection like labrynthitis but I don’t have any other symptoms which the doctors have also acknowledged. I don’t feel weak or like I’m going to faint or anything. Something else that might be unrelated but might as well mention is that I have had constant acid reflux recently, and lastly I’ve been feeling really sleepy and tired.

I have some blood tests and an ecg lined up which the doctors suspects will be fine but doing it just to cover bases. And after that they said they might book me a brain scan. What do you guys think? I’m obviously hoping this is just an inner ear infection but I feel seriously miserable with this and just want to get back to work because I can’t really afford to be off. Is it common to have these symptoms for so long with an inner ear infection?

Hello, I had an EKG done at an urgent care today because of some chest pain I’ve been having after a very high stress extremely high emotional few days. I went in because I am concerned about takotsubo cardiomyopathy. I saw the reading at the top which concerns me so I’d appreciate if someone could take a look.

Would that concern have showed abnormal results on the EKG if it was present? I have attached a photo of the EKG below.

I’m going through flight school, about to take my PPL flight test. I’ve been noticing that my eyesight has been blurry. When I did my medical last year, I scored 20/15 on the vision test. Even then, I noticed that when tired my vision would get slightly blurry. It’s worsened since then, but does not interfere with my flying. My vision is worse when tired, but not how it used to be when well rested 

I see starbursts with a long streak going through lights at about a 45 degree angle to the horizontal when looking at lights at night. Edges of objects are blurred at all distances, but worse far away. It seems to be slight double vision where everything overlaps sideways. It’s not too noticeable during the day, but night driving is not fun. Squinting doesn’t make it better, but opening my eyes really wide and straining can sometimes bring things into focus. Furthermore, my eyes feel extremely strained all the time. 

My best bet is to go to an optometrist. I know that. I’m trying to book an appointment but nothing is available in the next month.

Medications: 

\- 50 mg of Doxycycline (Rosacea)

\- 60 mg of Vyvanse (Inattentive ADHD)

I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with me for a while now. Puberty is seemingly when my health started going downhill. I am a 20-year-old male who suddenly developed Rosacea (Type 2) when I was 14. This is strange because only one other person (my grandmother, who has lupus) is afflicted with Rosacea in my family. I was given 100 mg of Minocycline to treat it, but I took it for too long and had to stop after noticing iron chelation/hyperpigmentation. I have a strong suspicion it might be iron deficiency (have not gotten ferritin tested, had normal hemoglobin) or maybe a gut-related issue.

I take a lower dose (50 mg) of Doxycycline now, along with fish oils and other supplements which have greatly helped. I still don't feel well at all, and I wonder if the supplements and antibiotics are masking the issues. Recently, I had to go without the supplements, and noticed the problems came back almost immediately. I will list my chronic symptoms below:

* Papulopustular Rosacea 
   * Reactions: Sunlight, Embarrassment, Exercise, Caffeine, Spicy Foods, High Amounts of Sugar etc.
   * My face gets red and sometimes I get pustules. My nose also secretes oil like crazy, it literally drips down the side of it.
* Dry Skin on Face
   * Very dry, very sensitive, persistent acne on my chin despite trying almost everything (creams, face washes, reducing shower time etc.)
*  Inattentive ADHD
   * I am aware that ADHD does not simply just come about. What concerns me is that even though I am on 60 mg of Vyvanse, my executive functioning and memory are still severely impacted. Even though medication is not supposed to be an all-in-one cure, isn't it supposed to help me a little bit? It is so hard and maybe even harder to start tasks than when I was unmedicated. My short term memory is also awful. Even for someone with ADHD, it feels extreme.
* Heart Rate Fluctuations
   * I tested it with a pulse oximeter while sitting and standing up and there was a noticeable increase (around 85 increasing to 105) but not severe enough to be called POTS. Exertion raises it and I find myself having to catch my breath and take breaks. I don't get that fluttering feeling that some talk about, but I do feel it bounding.
* Restless Leg Syndrome/Cramps in Toes
   * This is despite taking magnesium supplements and stretching/trying to be active
* Clumsiness
   * So bad I have to put it in here. Absent-mindedness to the highest degree.
* Feeling Cold Often
   * Especially in the fingers and feet.
* Persistent Fatigue/Malaise
   * Never enough to fall asleep, but always feeling like I need to rest. I need to emphasize that this state is constant, with stimulants making me feel tired but wired. Things exhaust me quickly and it takes much effort to get chores done. I would not say it's severe enough to be CFS, but I just do not feel well, ever. I do not have brain fog and I do not suspect that it is Long COVID, either. 
   * Although I am not passing out in sheer exhaustion, this symptom keeps me inside and stops me from doing daily things. My body is obviously trying to preserve itself at the cost of my own human existence.
* Sudden-Onset Exercise-Induced Asthma
   * I never had Asthma but around age 15 I developed it. The only reactions happen when I'm exercising. Not asthma attack levels, but still a feeling of not being able to get enough air in.
* Inability to Gain Weight/Muscle
   * I inhale the food at mealtime but rarely snack. I have stayed very thin and have incredibly low body fat and muscle. Food also seems to go right through me. As soon as I eat a big meal, I am using the bathroom, no doubt.
* General Weakness
   * Especially in my legs. When I sit, they feel empty from the lack of blood. Exercise wears me out and makes me irritable. Working out feels like it is out of the question for me because of how much it exhausts me.
* Anxiety
   * Although I have never had a panic attack, I am definitely on the higher-strung end of the spectrum. I am thinking constantly. It likely leans more toward paranoia. It is so stupid because I am aware that I am paranoid yet my executive functioning difficulties stop me from doing anything about it.
* Unfulfilling Sleep
   * Every single day, I wake up completely unrefreshed with at least one stuff nostril, an acidic stomach, a dry throat, terrible breath, dark circles, and irritability. This happens even when I have a humidifier, mouth tape, and air filtration.

The most overarching symptom in all of this is the fatigue and executive functioning difficulties. I wish I could find a more specific set of symptoms. But, something definitely feels off. I do not remember always feeling this way. Something changed. I know none of these seem very extreme but doing basic tasks is really draining in a way that it should not be. 

I need to know where to look and what tests to get. I feel pressed to do it soon so that these symptoms do not spiral out of control.

Hi dear physicians,

I had an MRI in December and a CT in February because I've been struggling with headaches, dizziness and tinnitus for a while now, they always find a sinus retention cyst in my right maxillary sinus, but all the ENTs I've went to have reassured me that those are benign and could not cause these symptoms

My symptoms keep getting worse and worse and I can't sleep at night worrying about that cyst being something malignant

Can anyone look at the slides I've attached below and tell me if this does look like a sinus retention cyst or if it could possibly be something else that I should worry about?

832,AskDocs,"Hello. I’m a 30 y/o male. I started having instantaneous episodes of dizziness on Feb 20th, maybe once or twice a day. Then on March 1st I became dizzy 24/7. I went to see a doc and was told I had vertigo. It was bad enough that I had to stop driving. Got some pills (betahistine 16mg) and tried them with no results. I also got some antibiotics as the doc said my right ear looked a bit red. On March 10th I stared having headache pain that I’ve never really felt before. The pain is like pressure spots on my scalp with a feeling of fogginess and tension throughout my head. One day the pressure points will be on the left side of my head, the next day they’ll be on the right. On March 15th I went for a head CT scan, fortunately the results were clear. On March 24 I was given migraine medication (sumatriptan 50mg, only 6 pills). Was told that I should take it at the first sign of a migraine. This medication doesn’t really work and it also makes me feel worse, giving me more fogginess and body aches. Every day it seemed that I was getting a tiny bit better but this weekend I feel the same way I did weeks ago. It’s not going away and it’s impacting my life. I can drive again but can’t really exercise or take care of my home without feeling dizzy, stress makes my headache worse at work and I get very inefficient.

I can’t take any medication. I was prescribed Xanax to treat anxiety at 17, and I became addicted until I was 27. It took me 2 years to properly taper off after having 2 seizures trying to quit cold turkey. I was taking over 20mg/day before I quit.

836,AskDocs,"33f, 4'11"" and 90 lbs; caucasian; experiencing the issue for about a month in the vulva area. Pictures at the end of post.

six months at least (pre-October '22) between my last and current partner (late March '23). Tested in December of last year, negative for BV, Candida, Trich, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and cancer-causing HPV strains. Tested positive around ten years ago for HSV1 but I've never had an initial genital outbreak which I've been assured I would certainly know if and when it happens.


About a month ago, a day or two before my first encounter in months with a ""clean"" partner, I started having a small pain on my labia around the time I began to ovulate which I initially attributed to vuvoldynia; I'm not unfamiliar with random inexplicable pains down there. I described what was going on to my doctor in a message (redness, pain, nothing to indicate broken skin or bumps) and she suggested Neosporin which helped with some redness and pain. For the past two to three weeks I feel like someone's been pinching my labia majora hard. The culprit seems to be between the folds of my majora and minora. I've been wearing cotton underwear and none at all at times. The middle picture, if you follow the irritation towards the top, seems to lead to a whitehead and there's some purpling there like it's a bruise but I don't wanna shave just in case that makes it worse. I don't shave all the way down and at the time the pain started it had been a few weeks since my last clean up; now I'm at the point where both majora have pain and I think it's due to the tugging of longer hairs. There seems to be no redness or anything out of the ordinary on the surface side from what's in the pictures. Nothing is necessarily tender or painful to the touch, nothing warm, including what's in the pictures.


I'm currently on Cyanocobalamin, Cymbalta, Hydroxyzine (as needed for anxiety), Dorzolamide-Timolol and Latanoprost. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, chronic daily headache, low vitamin B and glaucoma. I am a smoker (about 5-7 cigarettes a day). I have been using Neosporin on the affected area for about a week per my doctor with some improvement. 


Also this started to occur during a period of extreme stress as my cat was beginning the process of dying and passed shortly after. 

Any ideas on what it could be would be highly appreciated, I hope the photos are

840,AskDocs,"I (24f) am 5'9"" 150lbs. Vaxxed for the flu about 4.5-5 months ago. 

I haven't gotten tested for it, but I believe I have the flu (tested negative for covid/exposed to family member who had tested positive for flu 2 days before showing my own symptoms). 

My only symptoms have been swollen lymph nodes in my neck, an extremely minor bout of coughing maybe once a day at most, and a low-grade intermittent fever that I just can't kick. 

I've recently started antidepressants, so I've been avoiding general cold and flu medicine in favor of things that directly target my symptoms and being mindful of any drug interactions. 

Day 1: wake up feeling fine, around 2pm start feeling feverish (hot/achy general/malaise), take ibuprofen, fever gone by the time I go to bed and fever has worn off

Day 2: same as Day 1

Day 3: Feel totally fine, a little tightness in chest in the afternoon, took ibuprofen throughout the day before fever had a chance to show up no fever all day as a result

Day 4: Wake up feeling fine, quickly get very fatigued, extremely mild stretch of chest coughing in the afternoon, body temperature rises to the 100.4 area around 5/6pm, fever gone by bedtime with some energy returning around the same time (10pm)

Day 5: Wake up at 5am with low grade fever, take ibuprofen and go back to sleep, wake up a few hours later feeling totally fine with normal body temp, another short stretch of mild coughing, body temperature rises to fever around 5/6pm, take ibuprofen, no fever again by bedtime

Day 6: So far the same as Day 5 

I know with the flu you just have to rest and more or less let it run its course, but is there anything more I can do to kick this once and for all?

Non smoker ever

History of bad allergies, asthma, and anxiety. I take multiple allergy medications, get allergy shots, also take birth control for period symptoms but not sexually active.

I have always had a sensitive stomach and have been prone to motion sickness and vomiting somewhat frequently, however this got better as I got older (also as I got my allergy's more under control, PND upsets my stomach a lot). It does seem like any sickness I get works it's way through my stomach. When I have a stomach bug 1 get it really badly. When I was in high school and college I had an anxiety issue that caused me to throw up anything I ate when I was anxious, including me being on a no solids diet for a few weeks while they tried to figure out what was wrong with me. They ran many tests, including doing an upper endoscopy and checking for reflux and there weren't any major answers except that they could tell I had been throwing up and having an upset stomach. They said I didn't have reflux. When my period cramps weren't under control, I would throw up often and even when I started birth control I would get really nauseous after eating. My gyn suggested I start skipping the sugar pill week to avoid my period and this has mostly helped.

For the past year or 21 have been having random days where I get nauseous after any meal l eat.
This sometimes leads to diarrhea but not always and it hasn't made me throw up. I usually take Tums to keep it at bay. Sometimes after a few days of this it will all come to a head where I have terrible stomach pain and cramping and I can't leave the house that day, but sometimes it just goes away on its own. I have done allergy tests and tested for insensitivities and haven't had anything positive for food.

I believe this has something to do with having a generally sensitive stomach, having mucus and PND in my stomach, and possibly my cycle, though that's harder to track because I don't get my period. My doctor told me to keep a food log, but I don't think this is helpful because I don't think I have any intolerances.

Any suggestions as to what is going on? Things I should try? Things I can specify to my doctor to make him take this seriously? I have spoken to my PCP but if it is those areas working together against me, should I ask talk to my gyn and allergist?

858,AskDocs,"Hi all!

I am 28 yo AFAB, no current medication, stopped a 3 month course of vortioxetine over 2 months ago (with doctor supervision). Due to this prescription and concurrent reactive depression diagnosis, I am unable to be taken seriously in my country's healthcare. The response and focus on every doctor's visit is the depression diagnosis, not the physical symptoms. I see a psychologist and my symptoms are well managed, I was compliant with the antidepressant and we agreed with the doctor that medication was not needed due to *reactive* depression diagnosis. My country doesn't really know how to handle mental health, but we are undergoing a shift where it is being taken more seriously. Mental health issues are seen as weakness and disability. I hope this adds context and prevents the same situation here. 😅 Truly, the depression is well-managed with professionals. 

So, to the problems really bothering me. The weirdest thing is these are intermittent and kind of repeat in a pattern. Some I have a good handle on describing and others are a bit harder to pin down. 

- Previously (6 month) diagnosed ""nerve block"" (this may be a language problem, English is my only language and the doctors are not completely fluent) at C1 or C2
- Weakness at pinch (pinser??) test, full-fist squeezing. Left side
- Heavy, weak feeling (?) in left bicep and tricep
- No reflexes in left arm
- Muscle atrophy around left scapula, muscles in hand normal
- Tingling, burning, shooting pain in middle and ring finger, spreading now to thumb, in left arm
- Slight winging of left scapula
- Burning, shooting pain down between spine and left scapula toward hip
- Limited neck rotation in both directions, general tightness
- Pain around T6 or T7, originally where I thought the problem was 
- Shooting pain through left side roof of mouth to behind left eye. This leads to a severe migraine, which I do not regularly experience 
- Completely unilateral to left side

Of course, the symptoms above are quite straightforward. HOWEVER -- they come and go. I have the symptoms for a month or two, then they go away. They were gone for about 4 months, but now they are back, and maybe this sounds crazy, but I feel like they're getting worse??? 

Now, I get all of the above, but I also get this crazy feeling in my head. It starts with my neck is stiff (not yet painful), my shoulder aches, neck pain and stiffness worsens, pain travels down my arm and peaks in my hands. Symptoms in back and head start. However, instead of the shooting pain progressing to a painful migraine, I feel like I am about to have a seizure??? It is hard to explain without sounding stupid. I feel like my brain is floating away. I do not feel safe to drive. I feel that I am not walking in a straight line, but I am not sure this is true. I am almost dizzy but not quite. I feel like I am incredibly stupid, unable to process what people are saying to me, and unable to find words. I stutter, I delay answering questions to carefully plan my sentences, cannot process what I am seeing, almost. My vision becomes very blurry. I recently got new glasses and thought the prescription was wrong, but sometimes my vision is good but then my neck starts hurting and my vision is very blurry. 

Sometimes cracking my thoracic spine relieves head symptoms, but makes arm symptoms worse. This change is very temporary, like 20 minutes. 

This is a problem as I work in an animal laboratory as a surgeon (I am not a doctor!) and lives are in my hands. But I feel like a completely different person. I keep saying ""I feel like I have no brain"" when this happens. Sometimes if I take a nap the cognitive symptoms subside for a while, but after a few hours they are back. 

I generally feel very ""with it"" and feeling like I will faint at any moment, as well as kind of ""stupid"" (bad word but I don't know what else to say), is extremely concerning. I know the doctors will just put me back on antidepressants if I tell them this, but I feel there is something deeper as 1 the symptoms are worsening and changing and 2 the symptoms *start* physically and progress to cognitive/mental (mood is unaffected during these episodes). 

These episodes last 24 hours to about a week and a half. There isn't a break between them unless they just go away, otherwise I just wake up with a weird neck and shoulder and know it's starting all over again, through the weird progress. Often they end with a nap, and I wake up with a fresh brain and a stiff neck.

I am not sure I have explained this correctly. Please feel free to ask me any questions or have me clarify things. I am currently having the weird brain feeling so I am not sure this is organized or complete.

Final thought is that I just want to feel better and I will accept a diagnosis of ""just depression"" if that is truly all it is, but I really feel like it isn't. I just want to feel better and have a brain again. Thank you for your help and opinions.",t2_17fi7g,0,"Neck pain, arm pain/tingling/numbness/weakness, headaches...

35 M (formerly heavy drinker, 1 year sober) here. Recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic as well. Weigh about 185 lbs, 5'10 in height and live a sedentary lifestyle.

Have had blood in stool, usually bright red on both toilet paper and on stool on and off over the last few years (sometimes the blood is more maroon in color but not often).

1) How worried should I be that this is colon cancer?

2) I had MRIs and Xrays done recently on my lower back and SI joints (to rule out ankylosing spondylitis as a cause of LBP as there is a family history).

869,AskDocs,"25F- I’ve been having severe IBS issues for about five years now with the typical symptoms. I had tests done recently to figure out what’s wrong but the blood work came back fine. I thought I might have Celiac because I experience extreme tiredness and have trouble digesting gluten things + I get pretty bad heartburn after consuming wheat items sometimes as well. However, the bloodwork showed that I don’t have issues with gluten and my doctor said I’ll be fine, I should just ignore my issues and try to eat more fiber. Since the doctor has generally dismissed me, I don’t know what else I should do. 

Here are some symptoms I’ve experienced over the years: 
-Extreme pain in my lower abdomen about two hours or so after having certain foods (the trigger foods seem random to me) to the point where I can’t stand up. The pain is alleviated when I lie down but the moment I stand up it starts again 
-blood in my poop every now and then (maybe like twice a year)
-sharp pain somewhere in my rectum 
-sometimes I’m constipated, sometimes I poop too much (though it’s rarely watery) 
-tummy discomfort after I’ve had dairy or heavy food 
-heartburn 

I do not take any medication, have an okay diet with fiber everyday, take vitamins (multi, C, B complex). I will say I don’t exercise a great deal though.

I mainly work from home but also work in healthcare as Lab IT. Starting last year after we moved in to our new home, I’ve been sick so often with congestion, sore throat, phlegm and mucous, headaches, coughing, sneezing, etc. I had meningitis back in 2017 and I feel like my immune system has worsened afterwards. I read a scientific journal discussing macrophages not being able to fight against viruses and bacteria after meningitis. I had viral meningitis (not sure which virus), and I was usually never sick prior, at the very least not to this extent. I want to say it’s my son being in a preschool class and I could also say it’s my wife, but I normally live a healthy life. I’m working out (running) and eating relatively healthy. I am super stressed at work but I just got this job in December, so my health has definitely not gotten better but even prior to this job I wasn’t that sick. I’ve been sick since last year, before I switched jobs. February this year I had what seemed to be bronchitis (what the doctor told me). I had a steroid shot to stop the swelling/inflammation in my lungs and I was a bit better after that.

I have always had a pretty bad memory. Both long term memory and short term/working memory. However, lately I feel like it’s been getting worse. Sometimes simple things I have to really think about. Last night I was thinking about how old I was and even trying to calculate it based on what year I was born took me a few minutes. Ive been losing track of some conversations partway through. I have always had to make sure to put most of my “to-do” things/appointments or even just basic things I want or need to remember in my reminders on my phone, but I feel lately that I’ve had to do that more and more, and with more little things. I know that anxiety/ADHD/sleep apnea can be a contributing factor for memory issues, but would that be a reason for the sudden progression? It’s starting to really concern me. I do consider myself a bit of a hypochondriac but I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting or not.

877,AskDocs,"Going to quickly note I'm currently waiting for a new insurance to kick in May 1st.

Female, mid 20s, 5'3

WHAT HAPPENED: 
I was on the computer a bit late at night, 2 nights ago. My mom stepped out for about 10 minutes. A couple minutes into her being gone I felt a bit more off than I already did (tired + some eye strain). At first I was wondering if it was me nodding off but I think it was different. I think my vision was a little blurry and I couldn't read what i had just typed, or I had read/ written the 3 words I was trying to focus on out of order. It kind of felt like I was in a dream for a sec. I think my left eye felt weird/off, and I honestly can't tell you if the left side of my face felt a bit weird or if I was worried that would be next and was placebo-ing myself bc sometimes that happens. 

I was staying calm but for a minute I was wondering if I was having a stroke or something of some kind for a minute. I'm not entirely sure how long I was sitting there feeling weird for, all I know is my mom smoking usually takes about 10-15 minutes and I was okay the first few minutes she was gone, and by the time she came back in it was ""over."" 

The main thing making me paranoid is that my head on the top middle, to the left side, has felt weird on and off since. Especially that night, like there was a tension. Since, it's seemed on and off depending on stress or kind of like, if I'm trying to focus on something through a lot of background noise. I've seen too many medical shows so I just want to know my brain isn't like, bleeding or something crazy like that. I know, I'm paranoid.

Other medical stuff going on that might effect this: I don't usually get allergies, and I don't have a runny nose or anything. But because of the weather/season where I live, my ears have felt so full of fluid and I felt a bit dizzy/nauseous and stuff. I went to a doc and they told me it was bc of the crazy pollen count and told me to pick up Zyrtec and Flonase which has helped, though I've been slacking on the zyrtec and I feel like I'm back to square one on that front.

I also think im currently iron deficient but I'm waiting to co firm w a blood test, and have some iron pills I can take.
Eating habits and calorie intake could be better. 
Could afford to be less stressed. Noting that because my doctors attribute half my problems to stress and idk what to believe anymore, but that's beside the point.

Hey all, 

I recently noticed that while moving my hands downwards slowly, instead of a smooth movement, I can feel (and see) a jitter in the movement. This only occurs when moving my hands from an upward, palms facing out position (think of the hand motion for ""stop"") downward in a controlled fashion. I have also noticed that when I move my head down to my chest, my neck has the same, jittery non smooth movement. When I move my neck and hands at a normal speed of movement, this isn't noticeable at all, nor can I feel it.  Is this normal? Should I see my GP now, or is waiting for my annual physical ok? could this be connected to my family history?  Other important info: I have an anxiety disorder and I drink caffeine.

So a couple of months ago, after taking taking advil for months on end for a toothache) I went to get an advil and had a panic attack. (Shortness of breathe, rapid breathing, intense sense of doom) then next day I had a cookie and a panic attack again. Since then i could eat snickers, or anything sugar related without feeling a panic attack coming on. All of the sudden Im scared that I’m allergic to almost all chocolate related foods.

So two weeks after the panic attack from the advil I go to the doctor and tell them that I think I might have an ulcer. They agree and put me on ppi. 

Now I have been on ppi. However, now I still can’t drink milk, eat cheese or Mac and cheese without thinking I might be allergic to it or if I do convince myself that not I’m allergic to it. I still have adverse reactions to eating the foods. Like yesterday I ate Mac and cheese knowing that I’m not allergic to it and yes after eating rice and then eating the Mac and cheese. I still had a panic attack.

**Diagnosed** with Fibromyalgia and Endometriosis, though a recent hysterectomy and path revealed no abnormalities, thus the Endometriosis diagnosis is not confirmed. I've also previously been diagnosed with PTSD (Complex-PTSD), Depression, and Anxiety. Diagnosed with Post-Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. Blood tests checking for Lupus and thyroid abnormalities all came back negative. 

**Medications:** I was on Danazol from April 2021-January 2023, until my hysto. Currently just taking supplements (B12, Biotin, Magnesium Biglycinate, Melatonin) and Ativan 1mg as needed for panic attacks. I stopped taking tylenol/ibuprofen because it really wasn't doing anything to relieve pain.

**Family history**: Mother has some kind of thyroidism (can't remember if it's hyper or hypo), father and maternal grandmother both had Type-2 Diabetes (both deceased). Paternal half-sister has Lupus. At least one maternal aunt had Endometriosis.

**Other issues include**: concentration issues, memory issues, post-exertional malaise, getting sick all the time (I had COVID twice, the flu, and some other cold thing all within the span of 10 months, and this was with wearing an N95 mask and getting all my shots), hair loss, hair suddenly growing in curly when it was straight my entire life, weight gain, trouble falling asleep (usually because of chronic pain), not feeling rested when I wake up

**The Ask:** I'm looking for a second opinion. I know this could be CFS/ME and Fibro, but I just want to check and see if there's anything else that could explain wtf is going on with me. I used to be incredibly active and run half-marathons, and now I can barely get out of bed most days, and I just want to try to get some semblance of my life back.

I’ve been having constant lower left abdominal pains that move around my abdomen for the past 2-3 months now. I got a ct scan done and they said it was diverticulitis. That was about a month and a half ago. They scheduled me a colonoscopy two months out. The past two weeks have been the worst with the stomach pains and today I woke up and noticed blood on the toilet paper. When I went to the er they did some blood work and said it was probably an internal hemorrhoid. My neuts were a little high and my lymphs were a little low tho. They said I was perfectly fine and the bleedings probably not connected to my stomach pains. But just now I went to use the bathroom again and this time theres a lot more blood now it’s coating my stool. The blood is redder but some look like it could be darker.

It's gotten to a point where I have had to meet with a therapist to try and ease my crazy obsessions with my health. To put it in perspective I'm only 17, and I've already had multiple x-rays and 2 CT scans throughout my life.
From playing sports and being injury prone getting x-rays was the norm for me. I quite literally go in panic mode whenever I go to my annual check up to the dentist because I know I'll have to get X-rays and l'Il be damned to deny them because I don't want to seem like some insane know-it-all freak. But in regards to my previous CT scans, I had to get a head CT around the age of 7 due to having meningitis, so l'm aware that was a must in order to save my life, and the benefit greatly outweighed the risk. But I did have lumbar spine CT at 13 because of a prolonged stress fracture, which I still have chronic pain to this day. I had a ridiculously amount of MRIs, which I know don't have ionizing radiation but then they ordered a CT scan for my back after all the MRls, of which I'm confused as to why they did it, really because I'm not sure what a CT scan can provide rather than a MRI other than how quick it takes to get results.

Diagnosis: GERD, pelvic pain due to a trauma in 2021

I have had left hip pain for quite a while, since I was very young. Even in 2012/2013 when I was very young I had issues with my knees and received PT at that time, there was no “diagnosis” that I know of. Chronic low back pain/hip pain since 2016 that comes and goes, seems to “flare up” at times. Saw chiropractors in 2016-2019 off and on to try and help. Saw PT in 2021 for left hip pain that is localized to the back left side, lateral to the spine. The pain does not “shoot down” my leg like described in sciatica, I do have associated pain in my leg knee, but it does not travel from the hip pain to the knee, it feels separate.

The pain in my hip is more of a very deep, visceral ache. Accompanied with a deep burning pain. The skin at the back hip of my hip, and on the very side of my hip is numb to the touch. It is not pins and needles, it is like if you graze your hand on the area I can barely feel it. The pain is not constant, it has been okay for several months, there but not awful. Until about 2-3 weeks ago it seemed to flare up with no know accident or injury. 

I have other random symptoms that I don’t know if they are connected or not. I have lower back pain that has seemed to flare up with my hip pain. The lower back pain is lateral to my spine on both sides. I have a lot of joint pain in my wrists and fingers that I *would* describe as a shooting pain, this pain has been i screaming and happens weekly.A couple months ago I woke up and could barely walk because something was wrong with my right knee, it felt like if I put my full weight on it, it was going to snap.

888,AskDocs,"Posting for my grandpa. Extensive work up as below, being followed by Pulmology, GI, ID, and Oncology without any further ideas. 

&amp;nbsp;

82M (HTN, HLD DM2) diagnosed with ileocecal adenocarcinoma in May 2022 with metastasis to the liver. S/p primary tumor resection and started on chemotherapy with FOLFOX + Avastin. Complicated by portal vein and SMV thrombosis, resolved with Xarelto. Liver mets shrunk significantly and was about to transition to maintenance when symptoms started in late December 2022. 

&amp;nbsp;

Developed hypoxic respiratory failure with saturation into the 70’s (No diagnoses prior lung disease, was able to bike 5 miles). CT showed bilateral patchy infiltrates with neutropenia from chemo, so was treated for pneumonia with cefepime/azithro and then outpatient doxy (total 2 weeks abx). Minimal improvement, so returned for bronchoscopy with BAL that was ultimately negative for infection or malignant cells. Continued to have worsening hypoxia with persistent infiltrates and diagnosed with COP, started on prednisone 60mg daily + Bactrim ppx. Some transient early improvement in symptoms. Remained on steroids for 2 months before Pulmonology reevaluated and felt that he had too minimal improvement with steroids for this to be COP. Had transbronchial lung biopsy to look for lymphangitic carcinomatosis which was negative. Second BAL at that time positive for CMV. Pulm and ID said this was likely viral shedding and not an actual CMV infection, but ordered serum and lung PCR that are pending.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, he has been having respiratory symptoms with persistent infiltrates for 3 months. No chemo in 3 months. Around this time, liver enzymes rapidly elevate, peaking around AST/ALT 800 and Tbili 10. CT abdomen showed increased size of liver mass, but not consistent with the elevation in LFTs per his oncologist and GI. Gets MRCP that doesn’t show significant blockage of intrahepatic ducts, per GI. Liver biopsy completed, removed 800cc ascites as well. Biopsy results of 4 different area of the liver are pending, but we are told that it appears normal (aside from the known mass). CMV and others tests pending. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point he has an unknown lung disease that isn’t infection, fibrosis, or COP. Pulm and ID don’t have an explanation or idea for further testing or treatment. Currently tapering his prednisone and on 6L NC. LFTs are around 500 with Tbili 13. GI and ID don’t expect to find anything on biopsy and don’t think he has an infection. (He’s stopped the Bactrim, but GI didn’t really think it was the cause). We are told that he has stable cancer that is unrelated to his other problems. Where do we go from here?

&amp;nbsp;

Tests negative: Strep urine antigen , Legionella urine, Blastomyces urine, Histoplasma urine, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Fungitell, CMV serum, TB quantiferon

Hello, I have had patellar tendonitis on and off for slightly more than a year now and a few months ago I started taking rehab seriously. I've been progressively overloading it with body weight exercises like squats and step-ups and also biking but now I've gotten to the point where I have switched from biking to running. While running I am using a patella tendon knee strap. What I'm wondering is how long should I run with it and at what point should I start running without one.

900,AskDocs,"Hi ya'll! I'm 29F, 115lbs, 5'4""
Non smoker, healthy and active, rarely drink, no medications

Long story short, I've had issues using the restroom my whole life. I recently in life somewhat solved this through diet and healthy eating. I avoid processed foods and all bread. I don't really do grains, except white rice every now and then and oats. I've been pretty disciplined with this and have been going regularly, almost every day at least once. Sometimes more. However, I had spent a couple days in a row eating unhealthy things, which I don't usually do and I'm reaping the repercussions. I was pretty constipated and was reading about magnesium helping. Most people get the shits when taking it and I simply do not. I can't afford a better brand, but I bought the cheapest brand from Walmart and it's 100mg a pill. I've slowly upped my dose as I have realized that, while I have been having movement, it's still not much. Yesterday I took 400mg two separate times in the day and then 200mg, right before bed. I expected to have better bowel movements and still not much. 

Is 1000mg safe to take in one day? Does anyone else do this or take even more? Should I take more at once?

I've found it to help a lot with my mood and anxiety. Perhaps I've been very deficient. It's also not taken me this much time to get my digestion back on track, so I'm a little frustrated. I've been back to eating my healthy foods too. Perhaps I just really messed myself up.

None of my medications are new, I have been taking the same dosage of all of them for about a month and this problem has only showed up within the past week.

She massaged my back and down the legs and i never felt any tight muscles or anything like that, only when she pressed those two spinal discs.

  
This backpain comes up when i for example: wear tight jeans, a belt that isn't even that tight around my waist, even underwear that just holds relatively comfortably tight.  I work out a lot and never feel any pain as long as i lift with a proper form which you should do always.

  
After getting an x-ray and nothing came up from the pictures she recommended physical therapy without even being able to know for sure what's wrong, all she could way was that my back pain isn't normal and she doesn't see anything wrong with the pictures.  


Could this pain be called chronic? I've had this pain for years and some days i feel mostly fine except this small tingling sensation that I cannot iritate ever. and sometimes i go a week or two in agony. This pain is on and off constantly, i've cooled the area with a cold bag hundreds of times, chowed down over the counter pain meds and inflimation regulating meds like ibuprofein and paratabs.

Progressively through day got swollen and red rash appearing (was on feet from ~1-6 walking around but not exerting much very slow walking nothing I am not used to)

I am now struggling to bend my toes, flex and point foot, turn ankle. Red rash has moved upward and right is worse than left. Below the rash toward toes almost looks a little blue-ish purple-ish? I’m worried about circulation?? This photo was taken in the morning after waking up. Onset was about 22 hours ago. Struggling to walk and limping with worst as right side. 

I’m a very active person (rowing 2x per week, boxing 2x per week, running 1-2x). 

I just took 2 dual action Advil/Tylenol, Claritin, and I have hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl cream to try but haven’t tried either. Which should I use if any? Do I need urgent care?

About 4 years ago I started getting extreme pain in my abdomen and lower back. I started having really heavy periods which basically haven’t stopped since. I live rural and the healthcare system sucks here basically. It took about 2.5 years before the Drs actually started booking me tests (ultrasounds, blood tests and MRI’s)

So I had to wait one year to see a Vascular specialist. I only saw her about 3 months ago. I can’t walk or stand anymore, the pain is too intense. I’m on OxyContin 24/7. Bedridden since May 23. 

At first the Vascular specialist thought it was Nutcracker syndrome. I got an MRI and went back to see her. She said it’s not Nutcracker syndrome but might be Venous syndrome? I don’t know what they’re called but the veins on the left side of my ovaries? Are all twisted up. She asked if any relatives of mine have varicose veins. I told her my mother and uncle have them really bad.

I have to wait months for these appointments and was wondering if anyone might know what’s wrong with me?

Why have I been heavily bleeding for 4 years straight? I got a Mirena implanted but it came out a few weeks later. Now I’m on the implanon contraceptive (6 months ago) and I’m still bleeding. Another thing the vascular specialist said was that she couldn’t locate the clip on my left side from when I got my tubes tied. Thankyou.",t2_vbaquwya,0,I’ve had my periods for 4 years straight.

4 months ago I had an acne breakout severely after using Tretinoin cream and was put on doxy for 2 months to clear everything, skin was fairly clear after the course and didn’t have any acne while using adapalene, but I had issues with very oily skin and decided to ask for a prescription for low dose isotretinoin, 1 week after using it and my skin broke up like how I did from Tretinoin, I was very worried and contacted my doctor and he said it is best for me to stop. I decided to continue it for one more week to see what happened and my skin did get slightly better, with less oil and more dry acne, I went back to the doctor and he still said I should stop because my worsening of acne is uncommon and he said my skin bacteria infected, he said I should just stop it and start doxy for a while. I’m very confused as many medical forums and accutane users mentioned initial worsening of acne when starting my my doctor said it was uncommon and that “not everyone is suitable for isotretinoin and my skin type might not suit it” so I’m asking for second opinion on what do you think?",t2_vzlsfgio,0,"Doctor advised me to stop isotretinoin, looking for second opinion, please help",[],r/AskDocs,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,#dadada,public,0,{},,b54d8de2-6c35-11e9-924d-122677b24742,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.AskDocs,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,[],,,t5_2xtuc,,12odfka,True,yourstoicfriend,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,dark,/r/AskDocs/comments/12odfka/doctor_advised_me_to_stop_isotretinoin_looking/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/12odfka/doctor_advised_me_to_stop_isotretinoin_looking/,475224,1681658998,0,,False,1681659012,1681659013,2023-04-16 15:29:58,,,

930,AskDocs,"Hi All. 46M. 25mcg levothyroxine for subclinical hypothyroid (~month now). 

IBS for 10 years, diagnosed with hypertonic pelvic floor in 2021 via manometey and defecogram. High resting tone and dyssynergia. Biofeedback, retraining and PT helped get it under control.

A week ago I had a sudden regression. I’m having daily BMs but they’re incomplete and very different from my normal pattern, and I’m definitely not opening up correctly. 

I recently started working with a personal trainer for overall fitness and strength building (I think some weakness in my core could be a contributing factor on the PFD) and did a lower body workout last Friday (this started 2 days later)—so that’s a likely cause—but I would have expected it to resolve by now. We’ve put things on hold for now. 

I am going to PT on Wed and following up with gastroenterology this week. I also have a message out to my endocrinologist to see if it’s worth stopping the levothyroxine since I’m subclinical and I saw some mention of muscle spasms as a side effect (I realize that this is unlikely but trying to remove variables at this point). 

I went to an urgent care type place on Friday and they suggested some MiraLAX in the interim which is sort of helping (I’m carrying a stool burden at this point it seems). I’m also doing stretching and mindfulness exercises and have a wand for internal release, etc. but it’s not really budging. 

Any other ideas/thoughts for some relief? I suspect my PT visit will help but I’m really uncomfortable so anything I can do in the interim would be great.

For context, i have always had high UNCONJUGATED BILIRUBIN since i was 14-15 y/o. The yellowing of my eyes led me to get tested and seek a doctor. I was eventually told i have a mild condition and should not be a cause of concern. But I was never told of the exact diagnosis or condition. I got on with my life but the yellowness of my eyes never really went away (some days its mild but some days when i feel sick/fatigue it is really yellow lol) 

Im seeking another doctor and waiting for an appointment. For the meantime, i’d like to know from your expertise of what you make of these from my prev tests?

For the past two days I've been having this muscle spasm/pulsating feeling in my RUQ, right up under my ribcage towards my side, tip of 9th costal cartilage if im counting correctly.  Very minor discomfort on palpation. As of this morning the area aches when I cough or move. The pulsating sensation began once ever few hours, and is now roughly every 5 minutes. The discomfort doesn't radiate anywhere and feels quite localized currently. I'd rate the overall pain quite low, its noticeable but more anxiety producing than anything, maybe a constant 2. The spasms feel how I would expect a baby kicking to feel (just at a different location). This sensation is visible through the skin. it looks different than muscle spasms I've had in other muscles in the past, more like somethings pushing out for a brief second (or pulsating). Hopefully an alien doesn't pop out.

Prior to this starting I had a very large AYCE sushi meal. Going to have a fatty lunch shortly to see if this triggers worsening symptoms. 

Trying to determine if its just an abdominal thing or if my gallbladders being funky.

Quick side note- I previously suffered stage 2 colorectal cancer, which was resolved with chemotherapy and radiation. I’ve been cancer free since December 2021, and I get check ups every 3 months (blood tests, MRI, sigmoidoscopy) and each check up has come back clear.    
   
Since the start of the year I’ve had some health issues intermittently. If I make a bad dietary decision (ie eat junk food or anything very fatty/greasy etc), I will usually end up in a lot of pain during the night. Symptoms will usually come on around 2-3am and last at least 3-4 hours.    
Symptoms include:   
- bloating   
- severe upper abdominal pain that gets worse when laying down   
- acid reflux and the need to belch   
- diarrhea   



Once or twice I also felt some nausea but did not vomit.   
I would say I’ve had these “attacks” a dozen times roughly since the start of the year. If I’m eating okay then I don’t get any of these symptoms, they seem purely to respond to unhealthy/fatty/fried foods. The only thing that helps when I get these symptoms is to go for a long walk and stay upright until the pain passes.   
I spoke to my GP a few weeks back and he believes I have GERD and prescribed me PPIs. I’ve noticed the PPIs helped with the reflux but I still got a late night attack of abdominal pain and diarrhea. I’m going to see my specialist next week and I’m going to bring these concerns to him but I’m just hoping for some advice in the meantime.   
Obviously I need to stay away from the bad food that’s triggering this. My anxiety has me worried that this is some form of upper GI cancer because of my history, but then idk if this is maybe gastritis or something related to my pancreas or gallbladder?

I lift weights fairly frequently, and at fairly heavy loads, but nothing that I would consider overuse.

959,AskDocs,"25, female, 115lb, 5’2. I do not smoke but have in the past a handful of times. I’m currently taking no medication. I was put on protonix (pantoprazole) for 14 days but I stopped halfway through because of extreme flatulence and didn’t feel it was helping my cause. 

It all began March 25th, when I felt food had gotten stuck in the center of my chest. It was so uncomfortable, and a few days into, I would get on and off chest pains where the food felt stuck. It eventually went away but after a full week, the feeling of food being stuck traveled up to the base of my throat. Food started feeling like it was getting stuck there even though I knew most of it/if not all of it was going down. I would get very nauseous over this feeling and felt bile rise up throughout the days. I was also burping whenever I had this feeling so my doctor prescribed me protonix and sent in a referral to a Gastroenterologist. Most of the burping and the feeling of acid rising has stopped but the globus sensation is still present. He scheduled me a endoscopy the following week which we had to reschedule to next Thursday. So I’ve been going through this 3 weeks. On top of this, I’ve had an accompanying dry cough that makes an appearance more often than not since January. And because of the constant swallowing after food, I’ve been feeling a sore-ish throat. I’m always feeling thirsty despite drinking water and pee every 10-20 minutes (kind of burns). This could be from a UtI I had the week prior but my urine culture came back clean. Also my breath begins to smell pretty fast which is something I never had before. 

The biggest concern of it all is I found a super hard, un-moveable, lump sitting against my throat, inside my neck under the jaw (left side). Feels embedded in the throat. I just found it a couple nights ago and now have worried myself sick and basically convinced myself it’s cancer. I’ve never had heart burn before, never really dealt with stomach issues since I was a child. I just wanted to know if a GI would find cancer if it’s unrelated to the stomach or esophagus from an endoscopy? Can I tell them about the lump? Are there more possibilities other than cancer?

She's had multiple rounds of UTIs and one round of pneumonia since entering the facility in December, which I'm reading are two areas the bacteria can be problematic.  She has been moved to isolation ""for the remainder of her life"" and the facility is all but forbidding me to visit.  They're saying I need to wear maximum PPE when I visit and should exercise extreme caution as the bacteria is highly contagious with no cure at this time.  They're also asking that I sign a waiver to release their liability which I will decline.

I'm trying to educate myself on this bacterial infection and I'm not finding much of anything.  Actually, that's not entirely true.  There is a ton of information regarding symptoms and prognosis, but I'm not finding anything regarding best practices and living with the condition long term, both first person and third person.

I'm wondering if I can solicit some advice or links covering the following concerns:
- Is the contagion factor really that high?  Is the PPE really needed or is this going overboard?  Do I need a Silkwood shower immediately after visiting?  Hugging, skin contact, airborne proximity, general contact and perimeter concerns; General best practices when being around folks with the condition
- I bring my mom's laundry home to wash; Any concerns with the bacteria lingering on the clothing, and/or special laundry protocols to follow (hottest water, special laundry soap, etc)?

I crossfit 3x a week and eat Mediterranean diet, no red meat, all homemade food but probably too much salt.

About to start a calcium channel blocker. I’m aware that I should also reduce my salt intake but I’m hesitant to make a drastic cut there because seasoning my food is basically the easiest way for me to continue eating an otherwise healthy diet (75% vegetarian, all homemade). If I cut a lot of salt, I’m simply going to get a lot less enjoyment out of eating. It’s basically my only “cheat”

Here is a picture if that helps:

I hope it’s not liver/kidney disease related. My diet isn’t great, possibly built up salt bile? 

I’ve never had an itch last this long in my life and will definitely make an appointment to see a doctor soon but any thoughts on what this could be would be appreciated.

No way it’s just an allergy right?

984,AskDocs,"Okay, I am asking here, because really. I am at wits end.

Since last Wednesday I suddenly suffer from high blood pressure. And it just does not make any sense to me.

Now, about me. I am 33, assigned female at birth but I have since been diagnosed as intersex (XY and high testosterone levels), am 167cm tall and 83kg in weight. I was born with a heart defect (on the Atrioventricular node, I do not know what the name of the defect is in English), though I had surgery on that 10 years ago. It should be noted that up until that point I had chronically low blood pressure, even though it would spike up at times and go really high, but never more than an hour. Since the surgery I had higher blood pressure that was slightly elavated (around 130/90, at times up to 140/100), but nothing high enough for the doctors to actually put me on medication.

Just before Easter I got an infection. A very light COVID infection, probably (the PCR test on Tuesday had very low levels of the virus, though another PCR test done in the hospital on Thursday already came back negative already). I had a very severe COVID infection last year in October.

Now, last weekend I was mostly just super sleepy and tired, with rather low blood pressure (at times as low as 90/50). But it was better by Monday. I visited the doctor's office on Tuesday, where my blood pressure was worrysome for the first time. I was first meassured with 170/110, at which the doctor ordered me to lie down at the office for 20 minutes. When I got up, my blood pressure dropped suddenly to once again 90/60, but stabilized to 140/100 after a while.

Wedneyday was fine. But on Thursday I woke up to my blood pressure already high at 160/110. It went up over the day up to 200/140, which was when I decided to visit the hospital. I got emergency medication and the blood pressure once again stabilized. They also did tests of blood and urine, which came back with nothing much of note, except the fact that the infection pointers were high. Which was to be expected due to COVID. Even though, again, the PCR test done at the hospital, came back negative.

But it is Sunday now and no matter what I do, I will not get my blood pressure to drop beneath 160/100. I have now emergency medication at home and it just does... nothing.

And honestly, I am at my wits end. What is causing this? Why is this suddenly an issue?

I spoke to a friend in the field yesterday, and she wondered, whether it could have to do with allergies, given that I suffer from real bad pollen allergies.

995,AskDocs,"Down below I will post notes from my ENT and in the comments I will post photos that I just took. I have been dealing with extreme undiagnosed allergies/sinus problems or whatever it may be. Started with chronic ear problems with itchy, a lot of bright yellow squishy soft ear wax, ringing, wooing sounds. Then it went to my nose and throat now it’s to my eyes and head. I’m currently having so much pain and pressure behind my eyes causing horrible headaches and migraines. I can’t even wear makeup anymore because my eyes are in pain and watering more than half the day. Floaters/blurry vision at times. I am scheduled for hear/allergy/connection testing by they can’t get me in until June. I also have a CT of my sinuses scheduled but that can’t be until mid May due to my insurance. Ugh! Any advice on what this all can be in the mean time and what I can do for some relief?

Below is the notes from my ENT visit:

The following list includes any diagnoses that were discussed at your visit.
1. Hypertrophy of nasal turbinates
2. Bilateral tinnitus
• audiogram + tympanogram
• auditory brainstem response (abr) (PROC)
3. Chronic maxillary sinusitis
• CT, sinuses, w/o contrast
4. Impacted cerumen of bilateral ears
5. Conductive hearing loss, bilateral
6. Allergic rhinitis due to pollen
• allergy test, skin
• Nasacort 55 mcg nasal spray aerosol

Discussion Note
Patient is seen back in evaluation to her ears and sinuses. She reports sinus congestion, sore throat, cough and ringing in ears. She has been using zyrtec daily with no improvement. She has also tried flonase in the past with no improvement. As well as tropical and oral medications, and steroids. Physical exam reveals mild cerumen impaction in both ears which was removed with the use of surgical instruments, turbinate hypertrophy and tonsils absent. 
Nasal endoscopy reveals leftward deviated septum with obstruction posteriorly, turbinate hypertrophy and lateralized OMC's. Patient has a history and exam findings consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis with failed medical therapy. I have discussed underlying factors for chronic sinus disease including the role of allergy. In order to help elucidate a diagnosis as well as to evaluate the sinus anatomy I have recommended a CT scan of the sinuses  as well as allergy testing for further evaluation. I am also recommending that she obtain a baseline audiogram at her earliest convenience. I would like her to start a saline rinse followed by nasacort daily. She may continue on zyrtec daily.

996,AskDocs,"For 2 months now, I’ve had the mildest of “pain” in my upper left abdomen. About two inches or so over to the left from the middle of the upper abdomen. It’s not necessarily painful, it’s more of just a sensation that probably wouldn’t bother the average person, but bothers me simply due to the fact that it is daily for 2 months and ALWAYS in the exact same spot. Went to doctor and gastro due to having some blood in my stool where I did mention this but neither seemed concerned. When I look up stomach ulcers, it does sort of fit the “burning/gnawing” description but neither doctor mentioned this possibility. I have been on and off of a prescription PPI for 3 years now due to acid reflux and have been taking it more consistently since the beginning of this year. Can you still develop ulcers on a PPI? It is definitely ON the abdomen and not in my chest and does not at all feel like acid reflux to me so I don’t think it’s that. Again, it is consistently in the exact same spot daily. It only comes on for a few seconds per day and goes away quickly but still just worries me. Occasionally it will intensify and “hurt” slightly worse but barely and again only lasts a minute or so.

So for a week now I have diarrhea with abdominal pain/cramps right before I have to go on a toilet.

The consistency of stool is changing alot. From complete watery to mushy, 4 days ago I had medium soft stool and then it went back to diarrhea again. The urgency seems to come very quick aswell.

I have tried eating rice for 3 days maybe that made my stool go from diarrhea to medium soft but I dont know. I have then eaten just cooked potato with some baked turkey without spices or oil, Rice and some soup for the past 4 days.

I have no fever or headache and I generally feel okay.

I dont take any medication or anything.
